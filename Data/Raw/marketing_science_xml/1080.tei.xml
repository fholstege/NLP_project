<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>An important element of a firm's innovation management strategy is the acquisition of know-how that forms the basis of future innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Drucker 1985)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jelinek and Schoonhoven (1990)</ref> highlight, in industries such as semiconductors, computers, and biotechnology, "success lies in not pulling it off once but replicate technological innovations repeatedly over the long run." Innovation in such industries relies on cutting edge developments in a number of basic scientific and engineering fields such as materials science, electrical engineering, and electrophysics, e.g., IBM's development of a copper (instead of the aluminum usually used) interconnect for use on chips, which relied on breakthroughs in photolithography, electrical engineering, and design testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Spooner 2000)</ref>. While the renewal of its technological knowledge base is crucial to a firm, this is by no means an easy task. Given the sheer number and breadth of technological fields to draw from, no one firm can possibly hope to come up with all the required research on its own. This immediately suggests that every firm needs to look outside its boundaries and acquire knowledge from other firms, research labs, and universities to keep pace with the changing technological landscape. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Our work builds on the literature suggesting the importance of marketing in technologically turbulent and "information intensive" markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glazer 1991, Glazer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weiss 1993</ref>) by looking at know-how as an information asset to be acquired and utilized by a firm in its innovation activities. This lets us discuss theoretically how marketing can affect the ability of a firm to value technological options as well as its ability to utilize them effectively. Given the central importance of <ref type="bibr">Narasimhan, Rajiv, and Dutta: Absorptive Capacity in High-Technology Markets Marketing Science 25(5), pp. 510-524, © 2006 INFORMS</ref> 511 such renewal, it is obvious that firms that do better at this task would gain competitive advantage over their rivals. In the language of the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this ability to acquire and utilize external know-how could serve as a dynamic capability of a firm, leading to a sustained competitive advantage. Drawing on past literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen and Levinthal 1990)</ref>, we refer to this particular dynamic capability as absorptive capacity (AC).</p><p>The identification of AC with a dynamic capability suggests a number of research questions. First, because a capability can be a source of competitive advantage only if there is heterogeneity among firms in the possession of that capability we ask, What causes some firms to have a higher AC than other firms? Second, by definition, a useful capability has to have a significant impact on profits if it is to be a source of competitive advantage. This leads to the question, What is the impact of AC on a firm's profitability?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Related Literature</head><p>The theoretical base that our paper relies on is the RBV. This theory has emphasized the role of firmspecific resources and capabilities in helping a firm enjoy a sustained competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wernerfelt 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Barney 1991</ref>. We build on this notion by conceptualizing dynamic capabilities in terms of regeneration of critical resources. In addition, we draw on the stream of work on AC pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cohen and Levinthal (1990)</ref>. Theoretically, we build on the notion of AC as a dynamic capability by conceptualizing the process of know-how absorption as essentially one of properly valuing and utilizing a number of uncertain knowledge assets. Empirically, we advance the literature by using objective and precise measures for constructs such as technological know-how absorption and suggesting an econometric methodology to infer AC. We view one of our major contributions as the merging of the AC and the RBV literatures in a meaningful manner.</p><p>From a substantive perspective, our paper is related to a rich stream of work in marketing that has looked at the link between marketing and innovation. This work has pointed to the important role played by marketing in the new product development process <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gupta et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Griffin and Hauser 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Wind and Mahajan 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Srinivasan et al. 1997</ref>. Our work is also closely related to prior literature examining the process of information acquisition and formal planning in technologically turbulent and "information intensive" markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glazer 1991, Glazer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weiss 1993)</ref>. It is also in accord with literature in marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sinkula 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Moorman and Miner 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Miner et al. 2001</ref>) that has examined the role of information processing and organizational learning and suggested that the efficiency with which a firm uses knowledge is a function of its prior learning. Our work complements a growing literature in marketing that examines the role of information and know-how acquisition by firms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rindfleisch and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moorman 2001, Prabhu et al. 2005)</ref>. Finally, our work is related to current research in marketing that has used the notions of resources and capabilities to study issues such as the impact of customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mittal et al. 2005</ref>) and the option value of marketing capabilities, which lets them be deployed against future opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Moorman et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section develops our conceptual framework. Section 3 discusses our empirical model specification and outlines the econometric methodology we use. Section 4 discusses the empirical application in more detail-we describe the data set, operationalize the variables, and report our empirical findings. Section 5 concludes with suggestions for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework</head><p>The RBV suggests that firm-specific resources and capabilities are crucial to explaining differences in profitability across firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wernerfelt 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Peteraf 1993</ref>. While both resources and capabilities are sources of competitive advantage, RBV draws important distinctions between them. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amit and Shoemaker (1993)</ref> suggest that "capabilities refer to a firm's capacity to deploy resources, usually in combination, using organizational processes, to effect a desired end. They are information-based, tangible or intangible processes that are firm-specific and are developed over time through complex interactions among the firm's resources." For example, a firm's R&amp;D capability could be its skill at converting R&amp;D expenditure (a resource) into innovations. Similarly, its marketing capability could be the excellence with which the firm converts marketing expenditure (a resource) into such metrics as sales or customer satisfaction. We should emphasize that we are not suggesting that resources can not be sources of competitive advantage themselves; capabilities, by virtue of being complex transformational processes, are more firm specific and, hence, harder to imitate or buy, which potentially confers a sustainable competitive advantage on the firm.</p><p>The notion of resources and capabilities was further enhanced in an important contribution by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hogarth et al. (1991)</ref> and other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Teece et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Eisenhardt 2000</ref>. These authors suggested a multistage framework of competitive advantage, with stages steadily increasing in order of complexity. Earlier stages are "static" in that they deal with existing resources and capabilities, while later stages are "dynamic" in that they deal with the ability of firms to renew their resources and processes of transformation. We follow past literature by conceptualizing dynamic capabilities in terms of regeneration of critical resources. Our focus is on high-technology markets, marked by rapid change in technological know-how both in terms of the depth of know-how required as well as the broad array of technical fields used. The need to look out and acquire knowledge, then utilize it meaningfully, is crucial to the task of know-how regeneration. Past researchers have referred to this ability to acquire and utilize know-how from outside the firm itself as the firm's absorptive capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Levinthal 1990, Henderson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cockburn 1994</ref>). Given its central importance in technological renewal, clearly AC would be an important dynamic capability for firms in technological markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Conceptualizing Absorptive Capacity</head><p>In the RBV/input-output framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dutta et al. 1999)</ref>, one could think of firms using a set of resources at their disposal (such as R&amp;D and marketing expenditures) and combining these in a complex manner to absorb the maximal amount of know-how from outside. Clearly, firms that have more resources should be able to absorb more; therefore, while measuring AC we need to condition on the level of resources deployed. Thus, our conceptualization defines absorptive capacity (AC) as the efficiency with which a firm absorbs, relative to what it could have absorbed given the resources it has deployed. Our measurement of AC is consistent with this conceptualization. In what follows, we explain each of the components of our conceptualization: first, the resources that a firm has at its disposal to achieve its goal of absorbing know-how (which explain how much it could absorb), and second, the reasons for a firm's differential abilities to absorb technological know-how from outside, which is our conceptualization of AC. <ref type="bibr">Knowledge Absorption (Know-How Frontier)</ref>. The amount of know-how a firm can possibly absorb will depend on the level of its resources. We suggest three resources that we think would be important in influencing know-how absorption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Resources Influencing the Level of</head><p>R&amp;D Expenditure. R&amp;D expenditure is the most fundamental resource available to firms to produce technological know-how. All else being equal, firms with higher R&amp;D expenditure should manage to absorb more know-how <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen and Levinthal 1990)</ref>. Following past literature <ref type="bibr">(Griliches 1984)</ref>, we normalize R&amp;D expenditure with the firm's sales.</p><p>Prior Stock of Innovation. A large literature has pointed out the important role played by a firm's technological achievements in shaping its ability to utilize new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stiglitz 1987)</ref>. This literature has suggested that both the quantity and the quality of one's prior technological experience enable a firm to recognize and assimilate more know-how from outside <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cohen and Levinthal 1990)</ref>.</p><p>The existing literature, however, has not explicated the exact relationship between a firm's prior technology base and the nature of technological know-how that it wishes to absorb from outside its boundaries and outside its domain of expertise. One argument-the learning-to-learn hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stiglitz 1987)</ref>-is that of positive spillovers from past technological base to absorption of know-how even from hitherto new areas. Alternatively, a larger stock of prior innovations may actually hinder the firm from actively pursuing technological know-how from outside (possibly because of something similar to the "not invented here" syndrome). We treat this as a purely empirical question.</p><p>Marketing Expenditure. Firms that spend more resources interacting with customers will have a richer sense of the issues customers face with existing technologies and any technological breakthroughs by competitors. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Iansiti and West (1997)</ref> speak of the marketing resources spent by firms that enhance the "market sensing" abilities of a lot of the high technology firms. These resources enable firms to increase their boundary spanning activity beyond the status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Han et al. 1998)</ref>. This enables them to scan the market for new technological options and offer them a larger base of technologies to draw from based on customer and competitor interactions. As in the case of R&amp;D, we normalize our marketing expenditure with the firm's sales.</p><p>Summarizing, the maximum amount of know-how a firm could possibly absorb will depend on its R&amp;D expenditure, its marketing expenditure, and its prior stock of innovation. We can write the expression for the maximum know-how absorbable as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Maximum Know-How Absorbable = f R&amp;D Expenditure Marketing Expenditure, Innovation Stock (1)</formula><p>We reiterate that the dependent variable in Equation (1) is not a firm's AC but only represents the best-case scenario for know-how absorption. In reality, there will be a "gap" between the actual and the maximal levels of know-how absorbed. It is the firm's ability to get as close as possible to this maximal that represents its AC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Factors Causing Heterogeneity in Absorp-</head><p>tive Capacity Across Firms. Given the criticality of technological know-how, all firms in the industry are likely to be aware of the importance of know-how regeneration and would try to renew their knowledge resource bases as best as they can. One can conceive of this process as that of "looking" outside the boundaries of the firm and making judgments on what knowledge to acquire and what price to pay for it. The key here is that if all firms are aware of the exact value of the asset they wish to acquire and if this value is common knowledge, they will end up bidding such that there are no ex post rents to be had from the asset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barney 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Peteraf 1993</ref>. At this point it is natural to ask, What would help some firms to erect ex ante/ex post barriers to competition in the process of know-how absorption?</p><p>To clarify the discussion and make it more precise, suppose that there are a number of knowledge assets out there with a distribution of valuations. 2 For a number of reasons, however, there is uncertainty surrounding this valuation (such uncertainty would be natural in turbulent markets). Now, firms use some criterion to decide which asset(s) to acquire-the criterion essentially tells them how much to pay for the assets they do wish to acquire. (One could think of a number of criteria-firms could try maximizing expected value, or they could try minimizing the mean squared error; the exact criterion is not of primary importance here.) In this scenario, firms are differentiated from each other in two ways. First, they differ in their ability to pick the "winning" technologies. In essence, this amounts to making superior guesses on the correct valuation of knowledge assets in the face of uncertainty.</p><p>Second, having acquired these knowledge assets, a firm needs to transform them into innovative output. We suggest that some firms are better at transforming these knowledge assets into innovative output because they possess superior combinatorial ability and/or complementary capabilities that help them achieve superior outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Helfat 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Previous scholars have suggested a multistage framework of competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hogarth et al. 1991)</ref>, with stages steadily increasing in order of complexity. Thus, they suggest that dynamic capabilities that deal with the ability of firms to renew their resources and processes of transformation tend to rely on other complementary capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Teece et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Eisenhardt 2000</ref>, that are firm-specific and developed over time through complex interactions among the firm's resources. We build on this literature and suggest that a firm's functional capabilities in the domain of marketing, operations, and R&amp;D play a key role in enhancing the firm's efficiency in absorbing and utilizing technological know-how from outside, through enhancing the firm's ability to value knowledge assets, and enhancing the firms ability to transform these assets into superior outputs. We now discuss how each of the three functional capabilities enhance the efficiency of knowledge absorption (AC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale I-Superiority in Valuing Technological</head><p>Assets. We argue that both R&amp;D and marketing are important capabilities that enhance a firm's AC by impacting its ability to value technological assets. R&amp;D Capability. A firm which is good at technological innovation has evidently demonstrated a proven expertise in picking important technologies to work on. In addition, the firm's R&amp;D excellence in various fields means that it would be in a strong position to judge the relative merits of various technologies. For example, Intel faced a plethora of technological possibilities in designing its new manufacturing planta number of these technologies were new approaches to lithography and planarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iansiti and West 1997)</ref>. Intel's genius in this case was to choose correctly from among these options to come up with a setup that would work best. We thus suggest that superior R&amp;D capabilities will significantly enhance a firm's ability to value technological assets.</p><p>Marketing Capability. Marketing capability would be an important factor affecting a firms ability to pick properly from a variety of technological assets. First, for a firm to keep abreast of various technological developments, it has to have excellent abilities to scan the environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kodama (1992)</ref>, Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hippel (1989)</ref>, and others point out how firms with superior market scanning abilities seem to be much better at sifting through technological options; i.e., the cost of sifting through various options seems to be much lower for such firms, since much of the infrastructure in terms of firm-specific routines (e.g., for getting customer feedback) is already in place. Sharp, for example, is a firm that lets "demand articulation" drive a number of its R&amp;D efforts. Its investments in a number of nascent technologies that later paid off, such as opto-electronics, were a direct result of its expectations of what the market was going to be like in the future. In summary, we suggest that firms with higher market-scanning ability would be more efficient at sifting through various technological options and, hence, have superior absorptive capacity.</p><p>Rationale II-Superiority in Utilizing Technological Assets. We suggest that the following functional capabilities would enhance a firm's AC by enhancing the efficiency with which it utilizes technological assets.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Day 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Srinivasan et al. 1997</ref> suggests that a firm's marketing capability is one of the most important complementary assets a firm can possess, helping it to utilize innovations better. A superior marketing capability confers both demand and supply-side advantages to a firm; i.e., it helps reduce the cost of marketing innovations and increase the demand for the innovation among consumers. An excellent example of the role of marketing capability in a high-technology firm is Intel, which has successfully executed a branding strategy in the face of stiff competition from AMD that had developed faster chips multiple times. The advantages of picking the right technology and bringing it to market are particularly salient in hightechnology industries, since they are marked by short life cycles and a huge first-mover advantage.</p><p>R&amp;D Capability. A firm's R&amp;D capability is the skill with which the firm transforms resources such as R&amp;D expenditure into high-quality innovations. Clearly, a firm with high R&amp;D capability will be able to derive much greater benefit from a given set of technological know-how acquired from outside, since its transformation skills are higher. We thus suggest that higher R&amp;D capability would lead to higher AC.</p><p>Operations Capability. Operations capability in technology intensive markets entails the integration and coordination of a complex set of tasks. These activities consist of combining components and materials from different sources and industries and managing material flows to enhance output in an efficient manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hayes et al. 1988</ref>). Thus, the more efficient a firm is in this domain, the higher its efficiency in integrating know-how from outside. The complexity of this process makes it less imitable and confers an advantage to the firm in utilizing know-how from outside. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Iansiti and West (1997)</ref> suggest the crucial role played by operations in ensuring the successful conversion of innovations into usable products. These authors and others such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Srinivasan et al. (1997)</ref> have suggested how R&amp;D and operations capabilities rely on each other to help a firm come up with high-quality innovations.</p><p>In summary, we suggest how the three functional capabilities of a firm-marketing, operations, and R&amp;D-enhance the absorptive capacity of a firm along two dimensions. First, superior abilities in recognizing the true value for the asset, which means the firm (on average) chooses and pays correctly. This is a very important advantage to possess when so much uncertainty surrounds every possible knowhow asset. Second, superior abilities to utilize technological know-how which results in higher marginal returns and, hence, competitive advantage over other firms that might have paid identically for the asset.</p><p>Formally, our conceptual framework so far suggests the following relationship, explaining interfirm differences in AC:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Absorptive Capacity = f R&amp;D Capability Marketing Capability, Operations Capability (2)</formula><p>We would expect each of the factors above to have a positive impact on a firm's AC.</p><p>Finally, if AC is to be a meaningful capability, its impact on various outcomes (such as profits) should be firm specific. The second part of our framework below discusses this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Why Absorptive Capacity Matters: The</head><p>Impact of Absorptive Capacity on Profitability A high absorptive capacity has to do with regenerating a firm's know-how base and keeping abreast of cutting-edge scientific developments taking place outside. When is this ability likely to be of most use?</p><p>The answer is, precisely when markets are changing so rapidly and the environment is so turbulent that today's knowledge becomes obsolete tomorrow. Past literature points to significant differences brought about in firm strategy because of the rate of change of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Glazer and Weiss 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Balakrishnan and Wernerfelt 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Pasa and Shugan 1996</ref>. What this suggests is that the pace of technological change is likely to moderate the impact of absorptive capacity on profitability and, further, that the higher this pace, the greater the impact of absorptive capacity on profitability.</p><p>Yet another reason for the greater importance of AC in more turbulent markets relies explicitly on RBV theory. Recall that one of the factors that make firmspecific capabilities such as AC so valuable is that they cannot be imitated or bought easily. Now, faster change in markets essentially makes comprehending AC even harder for competitor firms-in the language of RBV, it increases causal ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lippman and Rumelt 1982)</ref>. Thus, as before, we should expect that AC should be even more valuable in times of rapid change.</p><p>In the next section, we discuss the econometric methodology that we use to estimate AC, highlighting the close links between our estimation strategy and RBV theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Measuring Absorptive Capacity: Estimation Issues</head><p>The econometric challenge is to measure a firm's AC (which is unobservable and, hence, cannot be measured directly) and to estimate the impact of firmspecific factors responsible for interfirm differences in AC. Recall that in our conceptualization, AC refers to the efficiency with which a firm absorbs knowhow from outside. This is estimated by measuring the shortfall between the actual and the maximal levels of know-how absorbable (again, an unobservable variable) given the firm's resources. Thus, to estimate AC, we first need to estimate the know-how frontier that gives the know-how absorbable under the most efficient deployment of the firm's resources. The technique we use, called stochastic frontier estimation (SFE), is perfectly suited to this purpose. It helps us infer capabilities (AC, in this case) from an observation of the outcomes of superior or inferior AC, i.e., an observation that firms have absorbed more or less technological know-how from outside. The SFE technique thus helps us stay close to the basic notion of capabilities in the RBV in that it treats capabilities as unobservable complex transformational processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Estimating the Optimal Level of Know-How</head><p>Absorbed: The Know-How Frontier The know-how frontier represents, in the input-output terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dutta et al. 1999</ref>), the maximum "output" a firm could produce given a set of inputs. Based on the earlier discussion ( §2.1.1), the task is to estimate the unknown parameters ( 's) of the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ln Know-How Absorbed it = 0 + 1 × ln R&amp;D Expenditure it + 2 × ln Marketing Expenditure it + 3 × ln Innovation Stock it + 4 × Market Conditions i + it − it (3a)</formula><p>or, more compactly,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Y it = f X it + it − it = f X it + e it (<label>3b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>A few comments on this specification are in order. First, note that the know-how frontier is given by f x it + it , where the first term (the deterministic component) represents the impact of deployed resources, while the stochastic term it represents "luck," or the impact of factors beyond the firm's control (e.g., macroeconomic conditions). We assume that it is distributed normal with mean zero and variance 2 , i.e., it ∼ N 0 2 , so that both good and bad luck are equally likely. The term it captures the "gap"/shortfall between the maximal f X it + it and the actual Y it ) level of know-how absorption. We assume it to be an independent and identically distributed nonnegative normal random variable, defined by the truncation (at zero) of the N</p><p>2 ) distribution with mode &gt; 0. To facilitate estimation, we make some further assumptions on the error terms, namely, that the random shock it and the inefficiency error it are independent, i.e., E it it = 0, and that these error components are independently distributed of the independent variables in the model; i.e., E X it it = E X it it = 0.</p><p>Second, one could argue reasonably that our resources are actually endogenous variables in that the firm would choose appropriate levels of R&amp;D and marketing expenditures with the production of some output in mind. Endogeneity is a potential problem in our framework and subsequent estimation. Unfortunately, this problem has dogged the literature on productivity measurement for well over four decades now. The theoretical solution to endogeneity is well recognized-use instruments for those variables that might be endogenous. It is the implementation of this theoretical suggestion that has proved problematic in that effective instruments are almost impossible to find. To quote <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Griliches and Mairesse (1995)</ref> " the available instruments are likely to be quite poor and possess little resolving power " In our case, with factors such as the "innovation stock" of a firm (involving long time lags), the task of finding appropriate instruments becomes even harder.</p><p>Given our distributional assumptions, for a sample of N firms with T observations for each firm, it can be shown <ref type="bibr">(Stevenson 1980, Battese and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coelli 1988</ref>) that the sample likelihood function for the SFE formulation corresponding to Equation 3(b) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L = N i=1 T t=1 1 2 + 2 × 1− Y it −f X it 2 + 2 − 2 + 2 × Y it −f X it + 2 + 2 × 1− − −1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where • and • denote the standard normal density and distribution functions, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Estimating Absorptive Capacity</head><p>Having estimated the model parameters ( 's), the predicted frontier is computed as f X it and, hence, the estimated shortfall isê it = f X it −Y it . Now, the second econometric task is to estimate AC from the shortfallê it above. As suggested earlier, the smaller this shortfall, the lower the inefficiency in know-how absorption and, hence, the greater the AC. However, it would be incorrect to ascribe the shortfallê it completely to a firm's lack of absorptive capacity. Thus, Marketing Science 25(5), pp. 510-524, © 2006 INFORMS a firm may have done badly because of bad "luck," i.e., causes beyond its control such as macroeconomic conditions.</p><p>Given our distributional assumptions, it can be shown <ref type="bibr">Coelli 1988, 1995</ref>) that a consistent estimate of the inefficiency for firm i in period t is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">it = E it e it =ê it = * it + * 2 − * it * 2 1− − * it * 2 −1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">* it = 2 − 2 Y it −f X it 2 + 2 and * 2 = 2 2 2 + 2 (6)</formula><p>A consistent estimate of firm i's inefficiency in period t is given by it . We normalize the highest absorptive capacity in the sample to a value of 100%, i.e., that firm would have inefficiency it = 0. With this calibration, we can write a consistent estimate of the AC of firm i in period t as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">AC it = 1− it (7)</formula><p>3.3. Explaining Firm-Specific Differences in Absorptive Capacities One of the main features of our conceptual framework in §2.1 is the heterogeneity across firms in their AC. To account for heterogeneity in AC, we assume that the mode of the inefficiency error term is heterogeneous across firms. In particular, we assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ln it = * + 1 ×R&amp;D Capability it + 2 ×Marketing Capability it + 3 ×Operations Capability it + (8)</formula><p>where is a standard normal variable and 2 measures the variance in the mode of the inefficiency term due to unobservable effects. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure gives us estimates of the parameters. From our discussion of the conceptual framework ( §2.1) we would expect each of the parameters to be negative and significant in its impact. The negative sign implies that the variable has a negative effect on a firm's inefficiency in absorption; i.e., it has a positive impact on a firm's AC. For example, we would expect that an increase in the firm's marketing capability would actually lower the mean of inefficiency (equivalently, enhance AC). It should be pointed out that this specification of AC heterogeneity adheres closely to RBV theory in that it attempts to explain some factors that would cause differences among firms in AC but still leaves a portion of the heterogeneity unexplained. This is as it should be-if we could explain all the heterogeneity in AC across firms, the capability would be rendered completely transparent and, hence, easily imitable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Estimating the Impact of AC on Profitability</head><p>Our conceptual framework suggests that the impact of AC on profitability will be moderated by the pace of technological change in the market. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dutta et al. (1999)</ref>, we examine relative profitability. We thus specify the profitability equation as: <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Rel_Profit it</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">= 0 + 1 ×Rel_Profit i t−1 + 2 ×Rel_R&amp;D Capability it + 3 ×Rel_Marketing Capability it + 4 ×Rel_Operations Capability it + 5 ×Rel_AC it + 6 ×Rel_AC it ×Rel_Tech_Obsolescence it + it (9)</formula><p>We would expect all the coefficients to be positive and significant, although the parameter we are specially interested in is 5 , i.e., the impact of AC on profitability after accounting for the effects of static capabilities (viz., marketing, R&amp;D and operations capabilities).</p><p>In order to account for persistence in profitability <ref type="bibr">(Geroski et al. 1993, Erickson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jacobson 1992)</ref>, we include a lag of profitability as an explanatory variable. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Apart from the fact that including the lagged dependent variable is essential to avoid misspecification, given the known dynamic properties of profitability measures such as ROI, doing so also helps isolate the impact of AC as a dynamic capability and rule out alternative explanations for its significance. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The inclusion of the lagged dependent variable implies that the usual fixed effects estimator is biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nickell 1981)</ref>. We use a GMM estimator proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arellano and Bond (1991)</ref>, which consists of sweeping out firm-specific effects through first differencing and then using lagged values of the endogenous variable as instruments. One has potentially a number of instruments available, with the number growing as the length of the panel increases. The fact that the residuals are mean zero conditional on the instruments gives us a set of orthogonality (moment) conditions. Given more moment conditions than the number of parameters to estimate, the model is overidentified and one can check for the validity of the moment conditions using Hansen's J statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hansen 1982)</ref>. Further, it is important for the consistency of the estimator that there be no second-order autocorrelation in the residuals; again, one can check for this using a Lagrange multiplier test (Arrelano and Bond 1991).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Application</head><p>In this section, we illustrate the theory and measurement discussed above to estimate the absorptive capacities of firms in the semiconductor and computer industries. We chose these markets for a number of reasons. From a theory point of view, such markets are characterized by intensive use of science and technology and rapid change, with firms needing to innovate constantly to survive. This is an ideal setting where the regeneration of know-how would be of importance. Further, firms seem to differ greatly in their ability to come up with new generations of technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Description of the Data Set</head><p>Our sample consists of 64 publicly traded firms whose primary business is in semiconductors and computers (i.e., SIC codes 35 and 36). More precisely, the SIC codes used are <ref type="bibr">3571, 3572, 3576, 3577, 3661, 3663, 3669, and 3674</ref>. Because our focus is on technological knowhow absorption as measured through patents, a firm has to have some history of patenting. We restricted our sample to firms that had at least 15 patents over at least five years. These numbers were chosen to ensure that firms had a "reasonable" history of coming up with innovations as measured through patenting, and that we could get a representative panel data set of firms. We had the further restriction that the firms be publicly traded (as it turns out, there are essentially no private firms that patent extensively, so this restriction does not rule out any more firms than the restriction on patenting above). For each firm in our sample, we collected information pertaining to the resources available to R&amp;D and marketing domains of activity from the Compustat database for the years 1980-1998. Financial measures were also obtained from Compustat.</p><p>The Compustat database, however, did not give us information pertaining to firms' innovative output. For this we conducted an exhaustive content analysis of patent data gathered from the U.S. Patent Office. This data yielded a number of measures, notably the construct of "outside technological know-how." While we go into details in the operationalization section below, we would like to point out that in all we performed a content analysis of over 150,000 patents. This effort involved extensive programming both at the data collection stage and at the content analysis stage. Descriptive statistics for key variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Variable Definition for the AC Equation</head><p>Consistent with our conceptual framework, our discussion of variable operationalization is divided into two parts. We first enumerate the dependent and independent variables that are important to the determination of the know-how frontier (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3a</ref>). Following this, we discuss the variables that account for firm-specific heterogeneity in AC (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>). Readers who are more interested in the estimation results and discussion can proceed directly to §4.4 without loss of continuity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Determining the Know-How Frontier (Equation 3a).</head><p>1. Technological Know-How Absorbed TKH_ABS . Since this variable is central to our empirical focus, we discuss its operationalization in detail. The variable conceptually represents the amount of technological know-how actually absorbed by the firm from outside. There are two parts to this definition that need operationalization. First, what is technological know-how? Second, what is "outside?" To operationalize both of these issues, we rely on patents. Each patent is classified under various nine-digit classifications called the U.S. classification. This is an extremely detailed technological classification system devised by the U.S. patent office (USPTO). The classes to which a specific patent belongs are decided by the USPTO examiner who awards the patent. We can determine exactly what technical areas a patent lies in by looking at the classes it is assigned to. The following steps illustrate how our measure is created.</p><p>(a) We examine each patent for each firm, for each year (our unit of analysis is a firm/year). Consider firm i, with J j = 1 J patents in year t. We refer to each of its patents as the focal patents in what follows and denote them as F ijt .</p><p>(b) First, we determine what classes each focal patent is in. Thus, suppose there are only two Marketing Science 25(5), pp. 510-524, © 2006 INFORMS focal patents, with patent F i1t in classes A1 C1 Z1 and patent F i2t in classes B1 C1 G1 Z1 . From this, we construct an array of unique patent classes for the firm for that year. In our example, this array denoted D it is given by D it = A1 B1 C1 G1 Z1 . Now, D it represents the number of classes firm i has patented in, in year t-we refer to this as the firm's domain of expertise (DOE). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Note that this takes into account the firm's history of innovation; if a firm has been patenting with fecundity in a specific technological area, knowhow in that area is clearly not from "outside," as far as the firm is concerned.</p><p>(c) Given the DOE, we now look inside each patent and get a list of those patents it has cited. The USPTO examiner ensures that this list is as complete as possible, since the scope of a patent's monopoly is determined by it. The list represents in an exact sense the "prior art" in the field that this patent is drawing upon. Thus, it represents the technological know-how that the firm is drawing on. We first knock out those backward citations that belong to the focal firm itself (these are self-citations). We now examine each of the remaining backward cited patents to get at a list of their U.S. classes. Thus, suppose our two focal patents F i1t and F i2t have backward cited patents B 1 , B 2 , and B 3 . Also suppose that the array of unique classes that B 1 through B 3 lie in, denoted as K it is: K it = A1 C1 R1 L1 . Call this array the know-how drawn on (KHDO).</p><p>(d) Given both the DOE and the KHDO, we now compare the two. More precisely, we count the number of unique classes that are in the KHDO but not in the DOE. This represents the number of technological classes that the firm has drawn on from outside its domain of expertise and is our measure of knowhow absorbed from outside. For the example above, classes {R1, L1} lie outside the domain of expertise of the firm. This count is normalized with the total number of classes that are backward cited, so our measure is continuous.</p><p>(e) In summary, the following points are important to clarify. First, the use of patent classes helps us define technological know-how very precisely, using objective classifications developed by the USPTO. Second, the measure defines "outside" in a precise manner-both as outside the firm's areas of expertise and as outside the firm itself. This is a fairly stringent measure-previous research has either used nonself patents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jaffe et al. 1993)</ref> or outside technological areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahuja and Lampert 2001)</ref> but not both.</p><p>2. R&amp;D Expenditure R&amp;D_EXP . This is defined as the amount of R&amp;D expenditure for firm i for year t, divided by its sales for that year.</p><p>3. Marketing Expenditure MKT_EXP . We measure this as the sales and general expenditure (SGA) for firm i for year t, divided by its sales for that year.</p><p>4. Stock of Innovation INNOVSTOCK . The technological output of a firm has been frequently measured using patent counts (see, for example, papers in <ref type="bibr">Griliches 1984)</ref>, which represent the number of patents assigned to the firm over a time period. Such raw output measures have been subjected to much criticism because they treat all patents on an equal footing. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Scherer (1965)</ref> has shown that "the distribution of patent values is highly skewed towards the low end, with a long and thin tail towards the high-value side" <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Trajtenberg 1990)</ref>, thereby implying that patents differ in terms of "quality." Thus, we need to adjust for innovativeness (quality) while doing the patent counts.</p><p>Consistent with the empirical R&amp;D literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Trajtenberg 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Jaffe et al. 1993</ref>, we measure the innovativeness of technological output by measuring the number of times the patents of a firm have been cited. The underlying premise here is that the more innovative the technology, the higher its citation count.</p><p>We construct the citation-weighted patent count as follows. We first calculate the average number of citations received by all the patents belonging to the firms in our sample. The weight assigned to a firm's patent, then, is the number of citations the patent has received divided by the sample average. Call the sum of these citation-weighted patents, for firm i, for year t, TECH_INNV it . The INNOVSTOCK it is then given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">INNOVSTOCK it = t k=1 t−k ×TECH_INNV k (10)</formula><p>Consistent with past literature <ref type="bibr">(Griliches 1984)</ref>, we form a stock with declining weights ( = 0 4) on past innovative output. Note that our data is necessarily right truncated, since some patents would still be getting citations after the cutoff date of our sample. We correct for the resulting truncation bias. (Please see the Technical Appendix for details at http://mktsci. pubs.informs.org.) 5. Market Conditions MKT_COND . To control for market conditions that might differ across various submarkets the firms are in, we divide our sample on the basis of the four-digit SIC code that firms are in. Our sample has eight such codes, with most firms falling in SIC code 3674. For estimation purposes, the variables are coded as dummies-we thus have seven dummy variables. <ref type="formula">8</ref>). Our conceptual framework suggests that functional capabilities such as marketing, R&amp;D, and operations enhance a firm's AC. The theory base we rely on suggests that capabilities refer to a firm's capacity to deploy resources, usually in combination, using organizational processes to effect a desired end (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amit and</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoemaker 1993, McGrath et al. 1995)</ref>. They are information-based, tangible or intangible processes that are firm specific and are developed over time through complex interactions among the firm's resources. Our operationalization of capabilities attempts to capture each of these aspects. Thus, we explicitly consider the resources available along the three functional dimensions and the desired outputs in each case. We then estimate the functional capabilities by calculating the efficiency of the transformation from resources to desired output. The efficiency of this transformation would vary by firm and would likely be a function of the kinds of complex interactions that are generally unobservable and hard to imitate, satisfying the RBV's basic conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Factors Causing Heterogeneity in Absorptive Capacity (Equation</head><p>1. Marketing Capability MKT_CAP . We proxy the ability of firms to scan markets by their marketing capability. To estimate marketing capability, we use the conceptualization and technique suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dutta et al. (1999)</ref>, which is consistent with the notion of capability in the RBV literature. Briefly, we suggest that the objective of the marketing function is to use the resources at its disposal to maximize sales. Given a set of resources, we can, using the SFE methodology, estimate the maximum amount of sales the firm could have achieved. The closer the firm's actual sales were to this maximum, the higher its marketing capability. We use as resources available to the firm the level of sales, general, and administrative expenditures (SGA) and the level of its receivables. Estimation is done using SFE (and is similar to the estimation of AC). Since we use observable resources to infer the excellence of the firm's transformative processes, this ties our methodology closely to the notion of capabilities in the RBV tradition. Further details of the estimation of marketing capability are provided in a Technical Appendix at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org.</p><p>2. R&amp;D Capability RD_CAP . A firm's R&amp;D capability follows a conceptualization similar to other firm-specific capabilities. Thus, we suggest that a firm uses the resources available to it (R&amp;D expenditure, prior technological stock) to try to maximize its output of quality-weighted innovations. The closer it actually gets to this maximum, the higher its R&amp;D capability. We operationalize quality-weighted innovations through citation-weighted patent counts. As before, we use SFE to estimate capabilities. Further details of our correction for truncation bias in citation weights and our estimation procedure are given in the Technical Appendix at http://mktsci.pubs.informs. org.</p><p>3. Operations Capability OP_CAP . Similar to a firm's R&amp;D and marketing capabilities, its operation capability is a measure of its ability to take the resources available to it (such as capital and labor stock) and minimize costs. We take the resources available to firms as capital and labor expenditures. Our output variable is the cost of goods sold. Again, SFE is used to estimate operations capability-details are given in the Technical Appendix at http://mktsci. pubs.informs.org.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Variables for the AC-Profitability Relationship</head><p>(Equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>) 1. Relative Profitability REL_PROFIT . We use return on investment (ROI) as our measure of profitability. This is defined as operating income divided by assets. It has been widely used in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erickson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobson 1992, Hult and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ketchen 2001)</ref>. We obtain the relative profit of firm i for period t by subtracting the sample average ROI for period t from the firm's ROI in period t; i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">REL_PROFIT it = ROI it − 1 N N i=1 ROI it 2.</formula><p>Relative R&amp;D Capability REL_RDCAP . We obtain the relative R&amp;D capability of firm i for period t by subtracting the sample average R&amp;D capability for period t from the firm's R&amp;D capability in period t; i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">REL_RDCAP it = RDCAP it − 1 N N i=1 RDCAP it 3.</formula><p>Relative Marketing Capability REL_MCAP . We obtain the relative marketing capability of firm i for period t by subtracting the sample average marketing capability for period t from the firm's marketing capability in period t; i.e., Our measure of AC it is obtained from SFE estimation using Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>). 6. Relative Technological Obsolescence REL_TECH_ OBS . To operationalize technological obsolescence, we develop a new measure based on objective secondary data. The idea behind our measure is as follows: The more fast-changing a market, the greater its rate of technological turnover. Thus, if market A uses newer technology (on average) than market B, we would say that market A is more fast-changing. In terms of our measure, a more fast-changing market would correspond to a higher rate of technological obsolescence. To operationalize this idea we look at the patents produced by firms in a certain market. Call these the focal patents, and suppose there are P of these patents. Now, each of these patents has a certain issue data associated with it, which is the date the USPTO granted the patent. Denote the issue date associated with focal patent p as T p . Now, we look at the issue date for each of the backward citations of each patent. Denote these dates by T pb , with b = 1 B, where B is the number of backward citations. Recall that these backward citations represent the base of know-how that the focal patent draws on. TECH_OBS is then computed as the inverse of the average difference between the issue date of the focal patents and the issue dates of the backward citations. Formally, we compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">REL_MKTCAP it = MKTCAP it − 1 N N i=1 MKTCAP it 4.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">TECH_OBS = 1 PB P p=1 B b=1 T i −T ib −1 (11)</formula><p>Clearly, the lesser the average difference, the newer the technology firms in the industry draw on, and the higher the rate of technological obsolescence in the industry, i.e., the higher the value of TECH_OBS. Similar to the other variables, we obtain the relative technological obsolescence, REL_TECH_OBS of firm i for period t by subtracting the sample average technological obsolescence for period t from the firm's technological obsolescence in period t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results and Discussion</head><p>Pattern in AC Over Time. Before we discuss the factors that cause firm-specific differences in AC, it is interesting to look at broad averages for AC estimates over time. Figures <ref type="figure">1 and 2</ref> show the distribution of AC for two different time periods, 1985 and 1995 (these represent years near the beginning and end of our sample, respectively). Two things stand out. First, the average AC for our sample has gone up considerably from about 31% to about 54%. Second, the heterogeneity in the distribution of AC has not changed much between 1985 and 1995 (the standard deviations are about 17.8% and 17.3%, respectively). These factors suggest that firms seem to be enhancing their AC over time-to the extent that AC is a source of regeneration and competitive advantage, firms seem to be taking the right steps to ensure they stay in the race.</p><p>Estimating the Know-How Frontier. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the frontier equation are given in the top half of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. Not surprisingly, R&amp;D expenditure has a significant positive impact on the know-how frontier ( 1 = 0 2649, p &lt; 0 01), suggesting that firms with higher R&amp;D expenditures can absorb more technological know-how. Since our specification is in logs, we can interpret the coefficients as elasticities. Thus, the elasticity of R&amp;D expenditure is approximately 0.26; a 1% increase in R&amp;D expenditure increases the amount of know-how absorbed by 0.26%. Marketing expenditure also has a significant impact on the frontier itself ( 2 = 0 4185, p &lt;0 01). Finally, a firm's prior technological stock has a strong impact on the maximum amount of  know-how it can absorb ( 3 = 0 6377, p &lt;0 01). Recall that we had suggested earlier that past innovative stock could affect the frontier in two opposite wayspositively through learning-to-learn effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stiglitz 1987)</ref>, and negatively through effects such as the not-invented-here syndrome. We view our findings as evidence that learning-to-learn effects seem to be stronger in our sample-firms that have been engaging consistently in the production of innovations are well positioned to enter new technological areas. Finally, although not reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, four of the seven market dummies were significant. Factors Causing Heterogeneity in AC. Coming to the specification for heterogeneity in AC, we find that each of the firm-specific capabilities has a significant impact. (Note that a negative sign before a coefficient implies that it has a negative effect on a firm's inefficiency in absorption, i.e., it has a positive impact on a firm's AC.)</p><p>As we had discussed earlier, capabilities refer to a firm's capacity to deploy resources, usually in combination, using organizational processes to attain a desired objective. Thus, capabilities usually refer to tangible or intangible processes that are firm specific and are developed over time through complex interactions among the firm's resources. This makes it harder for other firms to imitate firm capabilities, making them useful sources of competitive advantage. The finding that absorptive capacity is significantly influenced by the three functional capabilitiesmarketing ( 1 =−5 89, p &lt;0 01), R&amp;D ( 2 =−2 45, p &lt; 0 05), and operations ( 3 =−0 10, p &lt;0 01)-suggests why higher-order dynamic capabilities such as AC are likely to be even harder to imitate. This is entirely in keeping with what a resource-based perspective of the firm would suggest and emphasizes the role of dynamic capabilities as sources of competitive advantage. It is also in accord with literature in marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sinkula 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Moorman and Miner 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Miner et al. 2001</ref>) that has examined the role of information processing and organizational learning, and suggested that the efficiency with which a firm uses knowledge is a function of its prior learning. Our paper speaks to this literature by examining how the complex routines and processes developed over time in firms (as represented by capabilities in marketing, R&amp;D, and operations) impact the firm's ability to learn from outside.</p><p>The significance of marketing capability to a firm's AC complements a number of research streams in marketing. For instance, prior literature has emphasized the importance of valuing information, especially in turbulent environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glazer 1991, Glazer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weiss 1993)</ref> and the role of marketing therein. This is directly related to our paper, since a major dimension of AC is the impact it has on correctly picking technologies. Our conceptualization explicitly hypothesizes a role for marketing capability in picking the right technologies and is the first to demonstrate this significant role. Further, our finding also complements earlier research in the market orientation literature that has found a relation between a firm's market orientation and its innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deshpande et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Han et al. 1998</ref>. Specifically, we demonstrate a role for the firm's marketing capability higher up in the value chain of ideas, as well as its role in enhancing the firm's ability to exploit the technology it accesses to develop new generations of technology.</p><p>Finally, by examining the factors behind differential absorptive capacity, our paper complements a growing literature in marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rindfleisch and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moorman 2001, Prabhu et al. 2005</ref>) that has examined the role of information acquisition in interfirm arrangements such as acquisitions and strategic alliances. The notion of relative absorptive capacity of the partner firms plays an important role in the ability of the firms to benefit from such an arrangement. By examining the factors behind differential absorptive capacity, our paper suggests a reevaluation of the For instance, a firm with high marketing capability may be able to benefit from an R&amp;D alliance in terms of enhanced absorption of technological know-how.</p><p>Link Between AC and Profitability. We had hypothesized that AC would have a significant impact on profitability, with the impact moderated by how technologically fast paced the environment was. The estimation results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. All the variables except operations capability are significant and of the expected sign. As expected, there is significant persistence in profitability ( 1 = 0 382, p &lt;0 01). Hansen's test of overidentifying restrictions suggests the appropriateness of the specification ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>182 = 86 32, p &gt;0 1) in that the overidentifying restrictions are not rejected. Finally, the Arellano-Bond test does not reject the null of no-second-order autocorrelation (z =−1 43, p &gt;0 1), which is important for the consistency of the estimator used.</p><p>Turning to the role of AC itself, we find that AC has a significant direct effect on firm profitability ( 5 = 0 264, p &lt;0 01). This is the immediate impact; we can calculate the long-run impact of AC as 5 / 1− 1 = 0 42. The interaction effect of AC and obsolescence ( 6 = 0 187, p &lt;0 05) is significant and positive, suggesting that indeed AC has a greater impact on profitability in markets where technologies become obsolete at a faster rate. These two findings complement and extend prior literature that has emphasized the importance of valuing information especially in turbulent environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glazer 1991, Glazer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weiss 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Although enhancing AC takes consistent efforts over a period of time, our results suggest that these efforts do pay off in terms of their impact on profitability. In fact, the long-run impact is even greater than the immediate impact. On a theoretical note, the positive finding also supports the conceptualization of AC as a dynamic capability. It is interesting that even though industry experts have highlighted that it is very important for firms to renew their technological base by accessing and utilizing know-how from outside their boundaries, there has been little empirical evidence of such an ability having an impact on firm profitability. We believe that our finding is among the first to demonstrate a link between AC and firm profitability.</p><p>Finally, the finding that absorptive capacity has a bigger impact on firm profitability in more fastchanging environments suggests that this capability has the potential to play an increasingly important role in the competitive advantage of firms. In particular, as globalization and know-how transfer across firm and national boundaries leads to faster rates of technological innovations across diverse industries, firms that have developed this ability are likely to enhance their competitive position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper proposes a conceptual framework, with the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm as its theoretical underpinning, to explain interfirm differences in firms' ability to absorb technological know-how from outside. The paper contributes to a number of different literatures.</p><p>First, it contributes to the RBV literature by conceptualizing dynamic capabilities in terms of regeneration of a firm's resources base. The paper identifies the acquisition and utilization of technological knowhow as a dynamic capability and develops a framework for examining the dimensions of absorptive capacity (AC). This contributes theoretically to the literature on AC, both by tying it in explicitly to the RBV and by elucidating the factors that would affect know-how absorption. Methodologically, the use of the stochastic frontier estimation (SFE) is an important step that permits us to infer a firm's AC purely by observing how much technological know-how it has managed to absorb and by other firm-specific variables.</p><p>From a substantive perspective, it contributes to the marketing literature by emphasizing the role played by marketing capability at the earliest stages of innovation, i.e., at the stage when technological options need to be valued and chosen from. Given the important role played by innovative capacity and innovativeness in general, in theories of market orientation further evidence of marketing's impact on innovative capacity is indeed welcome.</p><p>The paper also suffers from a number of limitations that provide opportunities for future research. First, methodologically, one would like to control for the endogeneity of firm choices such as R&amp;D expenditure. Not controlling for endogeneity could potentially lead to biased and inconsistent estimates for our parameters. An ideal way to account for endogeneity would be to model the innovation process structurally, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Olley and Pakes (1996)</ref>. Second, one could conceptualize AC along multiple dimensions, e.g., speed of absorption versus depth of absorption. That is, some firms may be excellent at absorbing know-how quickly but do it over a very narrow area, while other firms may absorb more slowly over a broader area. Such a conceptualization would tie the notion of AC to ideas of exploration and exploitation and potentially permit a more fine-grained analysis of firm innovativeness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Distribution of AC in 1985</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">In the discussion that follows, we shall be focusing exclusively on technological know-how or knowledge. However, for brevity, we shall often refer to this as just know-how or knowledge. It should be emphasized that our focus is only on technological know-how.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">This and what follows is clearly a simplification of the process of knowledge regeneration. However, the simplification comes with a major payoff-while abstracting away from a number of issues that are not our focus, it helps us narrow down issues such as the "true value" of the asset, the "uncertainty" surrounding this true value, and the ability of firms to bid correctly for this asset.3  We wish to emphasize that the two cases discussed are to facilitate exposition of the knowledge-absorption process. Clearly, firms will not be engaging in just one or the other-and, equally clearly, both of the cases will impact knowledge absorption in tandem. A recent paper<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Makadok 2001)</ref> discusses similar dimensions in a slightly different context and refers to them as resource picking and capability building, respectively.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Our definition of relative profitability differs from some earlier definitions in the literature (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dutta et al. 1999)</ref>. Please refer to §4.3 here for additional details. The current definition is better suited to measures such as return on investment (ROI), which could potentially be negative. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out to us.5  We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out the importance of accounting for dynamics in the profitability specification as well as suggesting the specification we now use.6  We also compare the specification that includes lagged profitability to one that accounts for dynamics through an AR(1) specification on the residuals (following Smith 1992), and find that the specification with lagged profitability is superior. We thank an anonymous reviewer and the associate editor for suggesting this comparison.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">We experimented with various heuristics here, e.g., assigning a class to the DOE only if showed up more than a certain number of times, considering only the first three digits of the class, etc. Also, we considered the domain of expertise over a period of two to three years, i.e., considering all the classes the firm had patented in during the past two to three years. None of this made a significant difference to the results.</note>
