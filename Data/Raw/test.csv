However, prevalent behavioral approaches to sustainability interventions often have the unintended consequence of generating consumer resistance, undermining their effectiveness. With a practice–theoretical perspective, the authors investigate what generates consumer resistance and how it can be reduced, using consumer responses to a nationwide ban on plastic bags in Chile in 2019. The findings show that consumer resistance to sustainability interventions emerges not primarily because consumers are unwilling to change their individual behavior—as the existing literature commonly assumes—but because the individual behaviors being targeted are embedded in dynamic social practices. When sustainability interventions aim to change individual behaviors rather than social practices, they place excessive responsibility on consumers, unsettle their practice-related emotionality, and destabilize the multiple practices that interconnect to shape consumers’ lives, ultimately leading to resistance. The authors propose a theory of consumer resistance in social practice change that explains consumer resistance to sustainability interventions and ways of reducing it. They also offer recommendations for policy makers and social marketers in designing and managing sustainability initiatives that trigger less consumer resistance and thereby foster sustainable consumer behavior. © American Marketing Association 2021.",consumer resistance; practice theory; social change; sustainability intervention; sustainable consumer behavior,,"University of Queensland, UQ","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge the grant from UQ Global Strategy and Partnerships Seed Funding Scheme: Round Two 2018.",,"Atkinson, P., Delamont, S., Analytic Perspectives (2005) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 821-840. , Denzin Norman K., Lincoln Yvonna S., (eds), 3rd ed, Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE Publications,,., eds; Bardhi, F., Eckhardt, G.M., Liquid Consumption (2017) Journal of Consumer Research, 44 (3), pp. 582-597; Blue, S., Shove, E., Carmona, C., Kelly, M.P., Theories of Practice and Public Health: Understanding (Un)Healthy Practices (2014) Critical Public Health, 26 (1), pp. 36-50; Bolderdijk, J.W., Steg, L., Woerdman, E., Frieswijk, R., Groot, J.I.M.D., Understanding Effectiveness Skepticism (2017) Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 36 (2), pp. 348-361; Bradford, T.W., Boyd, N.W., Help Me Help You!

However, establishing and quantifying marketing’s causal impact on firm growth, while critical, can be difficult. This article examines the effects of a business support intervention in which international professionals from different functional backgrounds (e.g., marketing, consulting) volunteered time to help Ugandan entrepreneurs improve growth. Findings from a multiyear field experiment show that entrepreneurs who were randomly matched with volunteer marketers significantly increased firm growth: on average, monthly sales grew by 51.7%, monthly profits improved by 35.8%, total assets increased by 31.0%, and number of paid employees rose by 23.8%. A linguistic analysis of interactions between volunteers and entrepreneurs indicates that the marketers spent more time on product-related topics than other volunteers. Further mechanism analyses indicate that the marketers helped the entrepreneurs focus on premium products to differentiate in the marketplace. In line with the study’s process evidence, firms with greater market knowledge or resource availability benefited significantly more than their peers when matched with volunteer marketers. As small-scale businesses form the commercial backbone of most emerging markets, their performance and development are critically important. Marketers’ positive impact on these businesses highlights the need for the field’s increased presence in emerging markets. © American Marketing Association 2021.",differentiation; emerging markets; firm growth; marketing–entrepreneurship interface; premium products; randomized controlled field experiment; volunteer marketers,,"Indiana University, IU

The authors propose that one reason people undersave is because they hold the positive illusion of being financially responsible. If this conjecture is correct, then deflating this inflated self-view may increase saving, as people should become motivated to restore perceptions of financial responsibility. After establishing that people do hold the illusion of financial responsibility, the authors developed an intervention that combats this self-enhancing bias by triggering people to recognize their frequent engagement in superfluous spending. This superfluous-spender intervention increased saving by enhancing people’s motivation to restore their diminished perceptions of financial responsibility. Consistent with theorizing, the intervention increased saving only when superfluous spending was under one’s control and among those who were motivated to perceive themselves as financially responsible. In addition to increasing saving in Western countries, the superfluous-spender intervention increased saving of earned income and a financial windfall over time among chronically poor coffee growers in rural Uganda. Collectively, this work shows that people view their financial responsibility through rose-colored glasses, which can undermine their financial well-being. It also endows stakeholders with a simple, practical, and inexpensive intervention that offsets this bias to increase personal savings. © American Marketing Association 2021.",behavioral intervention; emerging markets; financial well-being; positive illusions; saving; self-regulation,,"University of Notre Dame, ND

Specifically, the authors propose that price promotions increase consumers’ perceived resources, which in turn increase consumers’ donation behavior. A series of seven studies, combining field and experimental data, provide converging support for this proposition and its underlying mechanism of perceived resources. Furthermore, the authors show that the positive effect of price promotions on consumers’ donation behavior is attenuated when consumers focus on the amount of money spent (rather than saved), when consumers feel they have overspent their budget, and when the monetary savings cannot be realized immediately. Finally, the authors show that this effect is stronger when donation solicitation occurs immediately after the price promotion (vs. after a delay). This research documents a novel behavioral consequence of price promotions and uncovers a mechanism by which price promotions can lead to positive social consequences and contribute to a better world. © American Marketing Association 2021.",donation behavior; perceived resources; price promotion,,"Nanyang Technological University, NTU

One strategy employed to promote this approach is to portray humans as machines. Five studies (and three replication and follow-up studies) using different human-as-machine stimuli (internal body composition, face, appearance, and physical movement) revealed divergent effects of human-as-machine representations. While these stimuli promoted healthier choices among consumers who were high in eating self-efficacy, they backfired among consumers who were low in eating self-efficacy (measured in Studies 1 and 3–5; manipulated in Study 2). This reversal happened because portraying humans as machines activated consumers’ expectation of adopting a cognitive, machine-like approach to food (Studies 3 and 4)—an expectation that was too difficult to meet for those with low (vs. high) eating self-efficacy. We tested a solution to accompany human-as-machine stimuli in the field (Study 5): we externally enhanced how easy and doable it was for consumers low in eating self-efficacy to adopt a cognitive approach to food, which effectively attenuated the backfire effect on their lunch choices at a cafeteria. © The Author(s) 2021.",(performance) expectation; artificial intelligence; dehumanization; eating self-efficacy; health; human-as-machine representations; machine,,,"We would like to thank Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises, in particular William Montagne, Kimberly Risso, Ghislaine Challamel, and Jackie Bertoldo for their help with the setting up and data collection, and Eric Montell, Michael Gratz, and Dr Shirley Everett for their support on this project.
