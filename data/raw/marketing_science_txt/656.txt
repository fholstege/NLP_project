This research has three objectives: (i) to compile analytical results on national brand and store brand marketing obtained from mathematical models, (ii) to assess the external validity of those results and thus the applicability of the results to practice, and (iii) to identify avenues for further research on national brand and store brand competition.
A total of 44 analytical results (29 related to retailer strategies and 15 related to manufacturer strategies) are compiled from a survey of literature published between 1966 and 2006. Three criteria are then used to assess the external validity of these results--robustness (R), empirical support (E), and credibility (C) (collectively, REC). Each result is quantitatively assessed (scored) using these three criteria. Robustness is measured as the total number of relevant market conditions for which the result has been shown to hold. Empirical support is measured as the number of independent empirical studies in which the findings are consistent with the analytical result. Credibility is measured as the believability of the theoretical result as perceived by experienced brand managers and retail executives.
Thus, the REC scoring approach represents a triangulation of perspectives--robustness (modeler perspective), empirical support (empiricist perspective), and credibility (managerial perspective). In particular, this research serves in part as a bridge between scholars and practitioners in the context of national brand and store brand marketing.

1. Introduction
Private labels or store brands are brands owned and marketed by retailers. Private labels, especially in grocery products, have witnessed considerable growth in the United States and other regions of the world. Dollar sales of private labels in the United States have grown at an average annual rate exceeding 7% during 1996­2005, or nearly twice the growth rate of national brands (Private Label Manufacturers Association 2006). Barring Costco (which has a 10% private label share), all the other top 12 world retailers have a private label dollar share ranging from 25% to 95% (Kumar and Steenkamp 2007, Table 1.1). As a result of this increased penetration, private labels are a topic of growing importance to retailers who own these brands and to national brand manufacturers who compete with them.
There has been a significant growth in academic research on private labels, consistent with the increased managerial interest. Beginning in the 1960s, survey-based research focused on identifying the

characteristics of store brand consumers. In the 1980s, research focus shifted to estimating the effect of marketing actions on national brand and private label sales using scanner data. Concurrently, numerous research studies employed mathematical models to specify equilibrium national brand and store brand strategies when these brands compete with each other.
This paper reviews mathematical models of national brand and store brand competition. Over the last four decades, researchers from both marketing and economics have analyzed different mathematical models and provided potentially useful results. In particular, these researchers have analyzed game theoretic models and generated comparative statics results that specify how changes in an exogenous market variable (denoted as x) affect the endogenous variable (denoted as e) in the context of national brand and store brand marketing in grocery products. Our first objective is to compile the key findings from these analytical models in the form of x  e relationships for communication to researchers and managers.

Mathematical models often make restrictive assumptions about the market structure for analytical tractability. For example, modelers of national brand and store brand competition in grocery products often assume that there is a single manufacturer and one retailer in a market. Such assumptions enable researchers to better isolate and investigate the effect of an exogenous factor on an endogenous variable, i.e., x  e relationships. However, more applied researchers are also interested in knowing to what extent these theoretical results would hold under different conditions observed in the marketplace, i.e., external validity. Thus, the second objective of this research is to assess the external validity of analytical results using three criteria--robustness, empirical support, and credibility. Two articles (Berges-Sennou et al. 2004, Sayman and Raju 2007) have provided useful reviews of the private labels literature. However, their focus is neither on analytical models nor on the assessment of external validity.
The process of compiling the results from analytical models and assessing their external validity reveals gaps in the literature, both in terms of strategies of importance to managers that have not been considered, and in terms of real-world market conditions that have not been incorporated into the model structure. Therefore, a third objective of this paper is to elucidate several directions for future research.
In summary, this paper has three objectives: (i) to compile analytical results on national brand and store brand marketing obtained from mathematical models; (ii) to assess the external validity of those results and thus the applicability of the results to practice; and (iii) to identify avenues for further research on national brand and store brand competition. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the criteria for assessment of external validity. Section 3 compiles the results and computes their external validity scores. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the results and offer several avenues for further research. Section 6 concludes by summarizing the key insights and future research directions.
2. External Validity Criteria
The central focus of this research is to ascertain the external validity of the analytical results on national brand and store brand marketing. In this context, we define external validity as the extent to which a theoretical result derived from an analytical model applies to conditions observed in the marketplace. We use three criteria--robustness (R), empirical support (E), and credibility (C) (collectively, REC)--for ascertaining the external validity. We first define these three criteria and then discuss the role each plays in the assessment of external validity.

2.1. Definition of Criteria
2.1.1. Robustness. The concept of robustness is used widely in academic and scientific research and relates to the notion of being powerful and sturdy. In marketing research, mathematical results are derived using certain assumptions about the marketplace. For example, in the interest of parsimony and analytical tractability, a researcher may assume that there is one manufacturer and one retailer in the market when deriving a theoretical result. If the result is also valid when there are two or more retailers in the market, then the result is said to be more robust than if it is not proven to apply under these conditions. Accordingly, we conceptually define robustness as the extent to which an analytical result holds under a variety of market conditions observed in the marketplace. We operationally define robustness as the total number of relevant market conditions for which the result has been shown to hold.
2.1.2. Empirical Support. Marketplace observations that are consistent with the analytical result clearly enhance the external validity of that result. We conceptually define empirical support as the extent to which an analytical result has been observed in the market. We operationally define empirical support as the number of independent empirical studies in which the findings are consistent with the analytical result. The count approach is used because there are inadequate empirical observations to perform a meta-analysis.
2.1.3. Credibility. Often a question asked of analytical modelers is whether the result is intuitive or credible. This question is addressed through the credibility criterion. We conceptually define credibility as the extent to which the analytical result is believable. We operationalize the criterion using a rating scale that reflects the credibility of the theoretical results as perceived by potential end users of the results--store brand marketers and national brand marketers.
2.2. Relevance of Criteria The three criteria--robustness, empirical support, and credibility--are not new to marketing scientists. In fact, most analytical studies provide some discussion of these criteria. The only difference is that researchers provide intuitive explanations to show that the result is credible (makes sense). We take an additional step by ascertaining credibility (face validity) from managers. In this process, we assess external validity through a triangulation of three relevant perspectives, as represented in Figure 1.
Each perspective has a place in our understanding of the private label phenomenon and in setting a future research agenda. Because the focus is on analytical models, we believe robustness is the prime criterion for external validity. A high robustness score

gives greater confidence in the applicability of the result to the marketplace; a low robustness score limits the market conditions to which the result applies and highlights the need for further research.
The empirical evidence criterion is the first support criterion. If an analytical result is robust, consistent empirical evidence further enhances the strength of that result. Sometimes, however, due to problems of analytical tractability, mathematical models can incorporate only a limited number of market conditions (low R score). In this case, strong empirical support (high E) suggests that, despite the mathematical result emanating from a stylized model, it is reasonable to believe that the result offers one possible explanation for the observed phenomenon.
Credibility ratings from managers provide face validity to the analytical result. A robust result that is also highly credible suggests that modelers and managers are on the "same page." It should be noted that although the first two measures (R and E) are more objective, the measure of credibility is more subjective and, hence, deemed a secondary support criterion. Nevertheless, agreement or disagreement from managers can help decipher the nature of the gap between analytical results and managerial thinking.
3. Compilation of Results and Assessment of External Validity
In this section, we describe the procedure used for compiling the analytical results and the methodology used for scoring those results on the three criteria.
3.1. Compilation of Analytical Results We selected published articles that satisfied the following criteria: (i) incorporated the competition between national brand and store brand directly or indirectly, (ii) provided results or insights related to national brand and store brand marketing, (iii) arrived at those results or insights using mathematical analysis and related arguments, and (iv) were published between 1966 and May 2006 (this review was conducted in the summer of 2006). We identified relevant literature through a combination of online searches (e.g., Web of Science) and manual searches. There are 22 published journal articles that satisfy the above four criteria. They are listed in the appendix (Table A.1a).

From the 22 studies, we ascertained or inferred the analytical result(s) or insights produced by the research. For each analytical result, we attempted to identify the underlying exogenous variable x , the endogenous variable e , and the conditions under which the result is stated to hold. Where the exogenous or endogenous variables were not clearly identified by the authors, we made our best inference. Those studies with common exogenous and endogenous variables were grouped together. Where comparative statics showed that the results could go either way (+ and -), both results were stated as alternate views. Table 1 lists the 29 analytical results related to retailer strategies and store brand marketing. Table 2 lists the 15 results related to manufacturer strategies and national brand marketing.
We also obtained an explanation for each result as provided by the authors, if available. Where a clear explanation was not provided by the authors, we inferred such explanation from their discussion or used our judgment. The details of the results and their explanations, written in nonmathematical language, are provided in the appendix (Tables A.2 and A.3).
3.2. Scoring the Results on Robustness Robustness is operationalized as the number of market conditions for which the result has been shown to hold. First, we list the market conditions and then describe the scoring process.
3.2.1. Development of Relevant Market Conditions. Broadly, the marketing of national brands and store brands involves four potential participants (players)--manufacturers of national brands and manufacturers suppliers of store brands who sell the products to the retailers, who in turn sell it to consumers. National brand manufacturers, store brand suppliers, retailers, and consumers represent four structural characteristics in the market (see Table 3). In developing their marketing strategies with respect to national brands and store brands, manufacturers and retailers take into account their cost (cost structure), consumers' demand for their products (demand structure), and the nature of the decision process (decision structure), resulting in a total of seven structural characteristics. Table 3 presents these seven structures and the 28 conditions within them along with brief explanations for their inclusion.
Clearly, these 28 dimensions do not capture all possible real-world conditions that may influence national brand and store brand strategies. For example, manufacturers may sell multiple products to the retailer, there may be a wholesaler between the manufacturer and the retailer, and so forth. However, we believe the list captures the basic market conditions that are important for studying the marketplace competition between national brands and store brands.

Notes. See Table A.2 for more details on the results and for a list of analytical and empirical studies supporting each result. R score: Top number in bold is the measure of robustness (maximum possible score is 28). The bottom number in parentheses is the average number of conditions examined per study across all studies that support the result (see Table 5 for illustration). E score: Top number in bold is the net empirical score (number of studies supporting minus number of studies opposing). There is no maximum for E score. The bottom three numbers in parentheses are number of supporting studies, number of opposing studies, and number of studies showing nonsignificant effect, respectively. E scores for results R1, R2, R16, and R17 include studies that provide indirect empirical evidence (see Table A.2). C score: Top number in bold is the median credibility score (maximum possible score is 10). The two numbers below are mean and standard error.

Table 4 lists the market conditions incorporated in each of the 22 analytical studies.
3.2.2. Scoring Robustness. We illustrate our approach to the quantitative assessment of robustness using the analytical result R1, which states that an increase in price substitutability between national brand and store brand increases a retailer's category profits from store brand introduction. Twelve analytical studies directly or indirectly support the result and they are listed as the top row in Table 5. The market conditions incorporated in these studies are represented as X in Table 5. Ideally, if one study could incorporate all of the conditions and show the result, then we have a perfect robustness score of 28. However, such a scenario is nearly impossible even with numerical analysis. So, we quantify robustness as follows.
We operationalize robustness as the number of market conditions for which the result has been shown to hold. Following this definition, we mark a "yes" for each market condition, if it is represented in at least one of the 12 studies that have shown the result (Table 5, last column). The total number of "yes" marks gives the overall number of market conditions for which the result is valid, i.e., the robustness score. The score for result R1 is 17 out of a maximum

possible score of 28.1 Using the same procedure, the robustness scores for all 44 results are computed and presented (in bold) in Tables 1 and 2 (R column).
3.3. Scoring the Results on Empirical Support We operationalize empirical support as the number of independent empirical studies in which the findings are consistent with the analytical result. For each analytical result, we searched for publications that provided empirical observations related to the result.2
Empirical studies that were included in this review are listed in the appendix (Table A.1b). For each analytical result, the empirical support (E) score was
1 One concern with this approach is that the score of 17 would be questionable if there were 17 studies, each incorporating, say, just one condition. The greater the number of conditions examined per study, the stronger the case for robustness. To investigate this concern, we computed the average number of conditions captured by the studies that support result R1 (i.e., the average of the numbers in the last row of Table 5). The average is 7.58, or 8 when rounded to the nearest integer. This number is presented in parentheses in the R column of Table 1. The problem of each analytical study examining just one or two market conditions does not exist for result R1 (and for the other results).
2 However, we did not review articles in the business press because (i) there were too many (several thousand) press articles, and (ii) our initial review did not reveal relevant empirical evidence for the comparative statics results.

3.4. Scoring the Results on Credibility We operationalize this criterion using a rating scale that reflects the credibility as perceived by store brand and national brand marketers (potential end users of the results). Credibility of each result was measured using a single 10-point rating scale. We first stated

the result and its explanation (as given in Tables A.2 and A.3). Then, we asked the following

Based on the explanations provided or otherwise, please rate the credibility of the result, i.e., the likelihood that the result holds in grocery product markets 1 = not at all credible; 10 = very credible .

Finally, we asked for comments (open-ended responses) on each result. (Only a few managers provided comments.)

Table 3 Market Conditions Considered in the Computation of Robustness Score

Market conditions

Description

I. National brand (NB) manufacturer structure 1. One manufacturer 2. Two symmetric manufacturers 3. Two asymmetric manufacturers 4. Multiple >2 symmetric manufacturers 5. Multiple asymmetric manufacturers

Many studies (e.g., Mills 1995, 1999) assume one manufacturer for analytical tractability. Some studies (e.g., Raju et al. 1995b) incorporate competition among national brands by assuming the presence of two or more manufacturers. These manufacturers may be identical or symmetric, or the manufacturer's national brands may be nonsymmetric. Thus, we have five dimensions describing national brand manufacturer structure.

II. Retailer structure 6. One retailer 7. Two symmetric retailers 8. Two asymmetric retailers 9. Multiple >2 symmetric retailers
10. Multiple asymmetric retailers

Almost all studies listed in Table A.1a either did not incorporate the retailer or included only one retailer. Only Corstjens and Lal (2000) considered two symmetric retailers. Nevertheless, there are five possible retailer structures along the same lines as for the national brand manufacturers.

III. Store brand (SB) supplier structure 11. Independent strategic player 12. NB manufacturer

Store brand supplier is assumed not to be a strategic player in most analytical models--the retailer simply obtains the product from the competitive open market at cost. If the store brand supplier is included as a potential player, then it can be an independent strategic manufacturer or one of the national brand manufacturers.

IV. Consumer structure--Segments considered 13. NB loyal: rpd  0 14. NB preferrer: 0 < rpd < U 15. Price shopper: rpd = 0 16. SB preferrer: -U < rpd < 0 17. SB loyal: rpd  0

Some studies analyze aggregate demand models without explicit consideration of different consumer segments. Other studies capture consumer demand through characterization of consumer segments. These segments mainly differ in their reservation price differential (rpd), defined as the price premium that consumers are willing to pay for national brand over store brand. Five types of consumer segments are envisaged. National (store) brand loyals will always purchase the national (store) brand. National (store) brand preferrers will pay a positive premium (up to U, where U is a large number) for national (store) brands. Price shoppers will simply purchase the lower-priced brand.

V. Cost Structure (NB versus SB) 19. Constant equal marginal cost 20. Constant unequal marginal cost 21. Variable equal marginal cost 22. Variable unequal marginal cost

There are fixed and variable costs of manufacturing the national brand and the store brand. By and large, the fixed (sunk) costs do not influence the marketing of national and store brands. The marginal costs of national brand and store brand can be either constant or variable (change with quality of product or quantity sold). In addition, the marginal cost of national brand can either be the same as the cost of store brand or different.

VI. Demand structure 23. Linear in price 24. Nonlinear in price 25. Category demand fixed 26. Category demand variable
VII. Decision structure 27. Stackelberg leader-follower 28. Nash simultaneous moves

Most mathematical models, for analytical tractability, assume that the demand functions for the national brand and the store brand are linear in prices. Some assume that total category demand is fixed. However, brand demand can be nonlinear, and category demand may change with prices and introduction of store brand.
A common assumption, in keeping with the sequence of observed moves, is that the national brand manufacturers are Stackelberg leaders. That is, the manufacturers set their wholesale prices first and then the retailers set the retail prices. An alternate possibility is that there is no leader-follower structure and that they both simultaneously make decisions--often called the Nash structure.

three questionnaires--two for retailers and one for national brand managers. The surveys were pretested, refined, and administered online through SurveyMonkey (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey instruments are available on request from the authors.
Our desired respondents were those involved in store brand marketing and merchandising (for the retailer results) and national brand marketing (for the manufacturer results). Links to the surveys were e-mailed to a sample of 350 retail executives, national brand managers, and grocery consultants based on lists obtained from Chain Store Guide, The List, Inc., and informal contacts. Completed responses were received from 65 executives. The two retailer questionnaires were each completed by 21 executives, while the manufacturer questionnaire was completed

by 23 national brand managers. Tables 1 and 2 present the median and mean C scores for the retailer results and the manufacturer results, respectively. We now discuss the results.
4. Discussion of Key Results--Retailer Strategies
We first classify the results based on their REC scores. The mean REC scores across all observations are 9.3 (R), 2.1 (E), and 6.5 (C).3 Accordingly, we used the
3 The correlations are 0.47 (R and E), 0.44 (E and C), and 0.04 (R and C). If there are sufficient number of studies or data points for evaluating R, E, and C, we would expect the correlations to be positive and fairly high. In our review, some results are evaluated based on just one or two studies, so it is difficult to interpret the correlations.

following cutoffs to classify a result as high or low on the three criteria: 10 (for R), 3 (for E), and 7 (for C). This procedure yields eight groups of results, as presented in Table 6.
Below, we discuss the five groups 1 3 4 7 8 from Table 6, in which there are at least two retailer results. For each group, we discuss the key results and propose future research directions.
4.1. Established Generalizations--High R, High E, and High C
Results in this group have the highest external validity based on robustness, empirical support, and credibility.
4.1.1. Discussion of Key Results. Many studies show a positive relationship between national brand versus store brand price substitutability and incremental profits from store brand introduction (R1)

using multiple indicators of the price substitutability construct: (i) cross-price sensitivity parameter (e.g., Raju et al. 1995b); (ii) size of switching segment (e.g., Narasimhan and Wilcox 1998); (iii) store brand utility as a fraction of national brand utility (Mills 1995); and (iv) cost of exercising a call option on the national brand (Horowitz 2000). Multiple operationalizations strengthen the robustness of the result.
There are two explanations for this result. One rationale, offered by Raju et al. (1995b) and related studies, points to the high margins obtained from store brands. In their model, in equilibrium, the retail margin on the store brand is greater than the corresponding margin on the national brand. High price substitutability increases the quantity of private labels sold. Therefore, switching consumers to higher margin private labels increases total retailer profits.

Notes. Refer to Table A.1a for study references corresponding to the study numbers. Robustness measure: R = number of conditions incorporated in at least one study = number of "yes" = 17. Average measure: average number of market conditions incorporated per study = average of numbers in the last row = 91/12 = 7 58, or 8 (rounded to nearest integer).

A second explanation, forwarded by Mills (1995) and Scott-Morton and Zettelmeyer (2004), states that high price substitutability makes national brands less indispensable, i.e., reduces the incremental contribution of national brands to channel profits, thus eroding manufacturers' bargaining power. Hence, retailers can extract higher profits and a higher share of channel profit if there is a store brand that resembles the national brand. Multiple explanations suggest different paths leading from the exogenous variable x to the endogenous variable e , thus enhancing the robustness of the result.

Empirical support for this result is predominantly indirect and includes studies that showed a positive relationship between price sensitivity, quality sensitivity, perceived quality (all potential surrogates of price substitutability), and store brand share, store brand proneness, and store brand margins and profits (all potential store brand success factors). See Sethuraman (2006, Table 1) for a compilation. Managers also assigned high credibility to the result. This result (R1) validates the common belief that private labels proliferate in categories with little differentiation between national brands and store brands (Stern 1966).

Result R2 considers the role of quality beyond its ability to influence price substitutability. Raju et al. (1995b) and related studies capture this role through an intercept term in the store brand demand function, representing store brand strength. Corstjens and Lal (2000) operationalize the quality of a store brand in terms of the fraction of consumers who try the store brand and find it "acceptable." They show that under certain broad parametric conditions, total retailer profits are increasing in store brand quality even if the store brand does not have a cost or margin advantage. The basic intuition behind the results of Corstjens and Lal (2000) is that a high-quality store brand differentiates stores from each other and increases store loyalty. Hence, even when a highquality store brand is not profitable, the optimal strategy might be to introduce the high-quality brand because ancillary benefits derived through the purchase of goods elsewhere in the store by the loyal consumer may be greater. Indirect empirical evidence (along the same lines as for result R1) and managerial feedback also support this result.
A third key generalization relates to retailer margins (R10/R10A). Conventional wisdom suggests that retailers would get higher profit margins on the store brands because they often obtain the store brand directly from the producer and do not incur significant marketing costs. Empirical researchers have made the distinction between absolute dollar margin (price - cost) and percent profit margin or margin as a percentage of price [(price - cost)  100/price]. There is high external validity for the result R10A, namely, a retailer's percent profit margin for store brands is greater than that for national brands; however, empirical evidence for the result R10 regarding absolute dollar margin is mixed and the result received a lower credibility score from managers. That is, the retailer's dollar profit margin on the store brand may be higher or lower than the retailer's dollar profit margin on the national brand.
4.1.2. Future Research Directions. Despite high scores on all three dimensions, there are some caveats

that limit the generalizability of result R1. The first limitation is the cost factor. The implicit assumption in most analytical models is that the cost of supplying a private label that is a close substitute of the national brand will not exceed the cost of the national brand. However, as Bontems et al. (1999) show and Sayman et al. (2002) point out, if the cost of providing a substitutable store brand is high, retailer profits from a store brand introduction may not increase.
The second limitation is the presence of retail competition. The grocery products retail marketplace is becoming very competitive, especially following the entry of Wal-Mart. However, no published analytical study has addressed the relationship between store brand introduction and retail competition.
A third limiting condition relates to national brand innovation and marketing and its role in category expansion. Result R1 probably holds for many products in the mature stage of the life cycle (category demand is fixed and the market is price driven), but it may not hold for products in the early stage of the life cycle. The reason is that when a highly substitutable store brand is introduced at lower prices, the national brand manufacturer is forced to compete on the basis of price. This predicament could reduce the manufacturer's incentive to invest in category expansion activities such as advertising and product innovation, a situation that may be unprofitable to both the manufacturer and the retailer. Analytical models could capture the distinction between mature products and products in the early stage of the life cycle, including the impact of national brand advertising.
A fourth limitation relates to asymmetry in crossprice effects. Most analytical models that derive result R1 assume symmetry, i.e., the effect of national brand price change on store brand sales is the same as the effect of store brand price change on national brand sales. The asymmetric price-tier effect theory proposed by Blattberg and Wisniewski (1989) suggests that the former effect is greater than the latter effect. How would the analytical result change if there

Sethuraman: Assessing the External Validity of Analytical Results

769

were asymmetries in the cross-price effect? This is an interesting question for future research.
A logical extension to the consideration of store brand quality and retail competition is the issue of premium store brands. The distinction between premium private labels (e.g., Loblaw's President's Choice and Marks and Spencer's St. Marks) and traditional store brands (e.g., Kroger's Big K cola brand) is the vision of retailers to differentiate their premium brands from the national brands on quality as well as to increase store differentiation. According to Kumar and Steenkamp (2007), premium store brands are one of the hottest trends in retailing. Yet, there has been no significant modeling work or empirical work that attempts to analyze the conditions conducive for premium private labels.
With respect to the result on retail margin, we find that the percent profit margins (margin as a percentage of price) on store brands is generally greater than the margin for national brands; however, the absolute dollar profit margin that the retailer obtains from selling one unit of the store brand may be higher or lower than the profit margin obtained from selling one unit of the national brand. Because a retailer's profit equals absolute dollar margin per unit times unit sales, the focus of the researchers and the managers should be on absolute dollar margin. Future theoretical and empirical research can identify the market conditions in which the absolute margins are higher for the store brand than for the national brand, and identify the conditions in which they are lower.
4.2. Potential Generalization Lacking Empirical Validation--High R, High C, but Low E
Results belonging to this group are those in which the empirical support score was less than two, but which are otherwise high on external validity.
4.2.1. Discussion of Key Results. Result R3 states that a high level of price competition among national brands decreases retailers' profits from store brand introduction. When price competition among national brands is high, the average national brand retail price decreases. The lower national brand price in turn depresses the price and retail margins for the store brand, resulting in lower category profits. For example, if Coke and Pepsi compete with each other aggressively on price, there may be little room for a store brand to enter the market and be profitable.
We believe result R3 is not so obvious and has important implications for retailers because it draws attention to both the price competition between national brand and store brand and the price competition among national brands. The two types of price competition have opposing effects on profitability from store brand introduction.

The effect of store brand introduction on national brand wholesale price, retail price, and retail margin are interrelated and, hence, are discussed together. The conventional economic view holds that a store brand introduction increases price competition for the incumbent national brand. The increased price competition depresses both the wholesale price and the retail price of the national brand, as shown in Raju et al. (1995b) and many other studies. It also predicts that retailers' gross margin on national brand also decreases with store brand introduction.
On the other hand, the bargaining model of ScottMorton and Zettelmeyer (2004) implies that retailers will be able to extract lower prices from the manufacturer by introducing (or threatening to introduce) a store brand of similar quality. In this scenario, the national brand wholesale price goes down but the retailer's price and margins on the national brand may go up.
Kim and Parker (1999) and Soberman and Parker (2004) offer a price discrimination view of store brands. They theorize that as national brand manufacturers increase advertising, retailers increase the price of both national brands and private labels because advertising allows retailers to better price discriminate across two segments (national brand seekers versus product seekers at whom the private labels can be targeted). Bontems et al. (1999) make a costbased argument that suggests that if obtaining a highquality private label is costly for the retailer, the national brand manufacturer need not accommodate store brand entry by lowering its wholesale price.
Which direction has greater external validity in our review? First, let us consider the question of whether national brand wholesale price increases or decreases with a store brand introduction. Comparing M4 and M4A (Table 2), we find that there is greater external validity support for the notion that national brand wholesale price decreases with store brand presence (M4). Comparing R23 and R23A (Table 1), we find that there is no clear winner. Retail prices of national brands may decrease or increase with a store brand introduction. Comparing R9 and R9A (Table 1), we find that there is greater external validity support for the notion that national brand retail margin increases with store brand presence (R9).
4.2.2. Future Research Directions. Perusal of the results in this group (Table 1) indicates that an E score of less than two was simply because of the paucity of empirical studies pertaining to those results. Therefore, a recommendation for future research is to conduct more empirical work.
In particular, analytical models provide multiple (price competition, bargaining, price discrimination, and cost) perspectives on the movement of national brand prices and margins in response to a store brand

Sethuraman: Assessing the External Validity of Analytical Results

introduction. One perspective may dominate the others depending on the market conditions. For example, the price competition perspective may dominate in mature or commodity products while the price discrimination argument may apply in advertising sensitive (hedonistic) product categories. Researchers can develop hypotheses linking market conditions to national brand price movement and test them empirically.
In addition, retailers said the directional movement of the national brand price will depend on the size and negotiating power of the retailer, strength of the national brand, store brand positioning, retailer objectives, and retail competition. These factors should be better understood and perhaps incorporated in future analytical models.
4.3. Theoretical Results Lacking Practice Substantiation--High R, Low E, Low C
Results in this group imply that despite fairly strong robustness, the empirical support and credibility scores are low.4
4.3.1. Discussion of a Key Result. A key result that falls into this category relates to price promotions. Price promotions are temporary discounts from regular prices. Two articles (Lal 1990, Rao 1991) state that the weak store brand, promotes infrequently or does not engage in price discounting at all. Their general reasoning is that the incentives for brands to price promote stem from having to charge a regular price to cater to its loyal customer base and occasionally make forays into the switcher segment through price cuts. Because store brands are primarily viewed as brands with little loyalty and catering mainly to the price sensitive (switcher) segment, this incentive does not arise. Therefore, store brands do not promote unless its switcher base is significantly threatened. Though not explicitly stated as a proposition, Narasimhan (1988, p. 441) also offers a similar recommendation--in categories where there are many brands with intense rivalry, the (store) brand that has the least amount of pulling power may want to keep a permanent low price and not discount at all.
However, this result was not validated on criteria E and C. Retailers disagreed with the theoretical premise that store brands should promote infrequently (R27 and R29). This disagreement is also
4 An analytical result with low external validity scores does not mean that the theoretical result is inherently wrong or invalid. In fact, an analytical result cannot be wrong unless the mathematics behind the derivation are wrong. A low E/C score means that the stated result is not generally observed in the market. It may be that conditions imposed in the analytical model are different from the conditions observed in the market, or perhaps decision makers' behavior in the real world is different from the behavior assumed in the theoretical model.

reflected in empirical work, which shows that private labels do engage in high levels of price promotions in grocery products. Ailawadi et al. (2006) explain (from CVS pharmacy data) that store brands have higher margins even after discounting, so promoting store brands is often profitable for the retailer.
Result R29 is a strong result that states that a store brand should not be price promoted. A counter-result (M14) by Raju et al. (1990) and supported under certain conditions by Narasimhan (1988) shows that the strong national brand promotes less often than the (weak) store brand. This result received mixed support with a credibility rating of five.
4.3.2. Future Research Directions. The above discussion reveals that while store brands are promoted fairly frequently, it is not clear whether they are promoted more often than national brands. The reasons for promoting private labels, as stated by managers, include (i) the need to protect store brand turf, (ii) the need to generate trial and repeat of store brand, (iii) the desire to simply promote what customers want, and (iv) the potential for higher margins. Future research could incorporate some of these factors and illuminate the reasons for store brand price promotion through more theoretical and empirical investigation.
4.4. Conventional Wisdom--Low R, Low E, but High C
Results in this group have low R scores primarily because very few analytical studies have investigated the comparative statics results. These results have low E scores because few empirical studies have tested them. However, because they score high on managerial credibility, we refer to the results as conventional wisdom.
4.4.1. Discussion of Key Results. Common belief would indicate that there is no place for a store brand when there is already a large number of national brands. Accordingly, Schmalensee (1978) argues that preemptive product differentiation and proliferation by incumbents in a market can deter a store brand entrant. Contrary to this common belief, Raju et al. (1995b) show analytically that retailers would find it more profitable to introduce a store brand in categories with a large number of national brands. They reason that it is easy to "sneak in" a store brand without affecting the profits of the existing brands when the number of existing national brands is large. Although they do not explicitly model the number of national brands, Scott-Morton and Zettelmeyer (2004) argue that more manufacturers actively producing national brands indicates fewer barriers to entry; hence, the retailer can easily find a supplier for its store brand.
Our assessment of external validity suggests that result R4 dominates result R4A. That is, categories

Sethuraman: Assessing the External Validity of Analytical Results

Marketing Science 28(4), pp. 759­781, © 2009 INFORMS

771

with a large number of national brands may actually be conducive for store brand introduction. In addition to the explanations provided above, a supporting argument offered by the managers is that when there are many national brands, each one on average tends not to be very strong and, therefore, provides an opportunity for store brands to enter.
When selecting a store brand supplier, the retailer has three options: (i) procure from an independent (fringe) manufacturer, (ii) obtain from a national brand manufacturer (dual branding), or (iii) produce its own store brands. Broadly, there are two considerations for both the retailer and the manufacturer to participate in dual branding--cost consideration and strategic consideration.
Cost consideration is advanced by Peles (1972) and Mills (1999)--results M1 and R7. If, and only if, the national brand manufacturer has a cost advantage of supplying a private label over other competitive suppliers, then in equilibrium the manufacturer will offer to produce the private label, and the retailer will accept the offer so long as there are no externalities such as increased bargaining power. The intuition is that if there is cost advantage, the manufacturer can foreclose supplies from an independent manufacturer, and the brand manufacturer makes more profit than it would selling just its own premium brand. Cost advantage can arise through economies of scale or excess capacity (Peles 1972, Quelch and Harding 1996).
Price discrimination is one strategic consideration for dual branding. Soberman and Parker (2004) argue that if consumers are clearly segmented as product seekers (who buy only based on price and are not advertising sensitive) and brand seekers (who prefer national brands and are advertising sensitive) and if the manufacturer can determine the wholesale price of both the national brand and the private label, then the manufacturer should always be willing to supply private labels. In their model, the private label is a gift from the retailer to the manufacturer because it allows manufacturers to discriminate between brand seekers and product seekers (Soberman and Parker 2004). Price discrimination as a motive for dual branding has been a subject of many Federal Trade Commission enquiries even from the 1960s (Stern 1966).
Other considerations for engaging in dual branding from a retailer perspective are: (i) quality assurance and (ii) increased cooperation from the national brand manufacturer, especially in a market where there are many store switchers. Considerations from the manufacturer perspective include (i) increased bargaining power with the retailer and (ii) possible cooperative arrangements with the retailer (Quelch and Harding 1996, Dunne and Narasimhan 1999).
4.4.2. Future Research Directions. Dual branding is fairly common in the grocery products market.

However, there is scant literature on both the analytical and empirical fronts. Given the richness of the phenomenon and the high level of managerial interest, there is a need to advance our understanding of dual branding through further analytical and empirical work.
4.5. Unsupported Results--Low R, E, and C Scores
Results in this group have low external validity along all three dimensions.
4.5.1. Discussion of a Key Result. Many results in this group have been discussed earlier. The one result that we believe needs greater understanding relates to preference heterogeneity.
Suppose there are two markets, both having the same average relative preference (reservation price differential) for national brands over store brands. In one market, the distribution of preference is homogeneous around the mean--all households have the same relative preference. In the other market, the distribution of preference is heterogeneous. In which market should a store brand be introduced? Narasimhan and Wilcox (1998) have shown that the likelihood of store brand introduction decreases with an increase in heterogeneity. The reason is that by introducing a store brand in a homogeneous market, the retailer can avail its ability to significantly alter market shares through small changes in price differential and gain profits.
4.5.2. Future Research Directions. Heterogeneity among consumers is an important consideration for modelers and practitioners alike. There is a clear need for understanding the effect of consumer heterogeneity on the marketing of national brands and store brands.
5. Discussion of Results--Manufacturer Strategies
Because of the scarcity of analytical work and manufacturer data, most manufacturer results have low R and E scores and fall in the conventional wisdom and unsupported results groups, depending on whether the results were considered more credible C  7 or less credible C < 7 by managers.
5.1. Conventional Wisdom--Low R, Low E, but High C
5.1.1. Discussion of Key Results. Because of their interrelated nature, some key manufacturer results have already been discussed in §4 along with retailer strategies. Among other results, advertising highquality national brands (M3) and offering a twopart tariff (quantity discount) to retailers to sell more

Sethuraman: Assessing the External Validity of Analytical Results

772

Marketing Science 28(4), pp. 759­781, © 2009 INFORMS

national brands (M6) were two national brand counterstrategies that received a good credibility rating (7 of 10). One national brand manager commented that offering quantity discounts was a "great idea and [I] hope the retailers can be convinced of the same!" The strongest managerial support was for result M7, which states that slotting allowances are not a viable strategy for deterring private label entry. In addition, coupons targeted at private label buyers accompanied by an increase in the regular price of national brands could increase the profits for both manufacturers and retailers. Another result with high credibility is that the national brands are discounted more deeply than the store brands (M15).
5.1.2. Future Research Directions. Many analytical results related to national brand counterstrategies were obtained from just one article (Mills 1999). This article studies only a two-firm vertical market structure (one manufacturer and one retailer). Clearly, there is a need to include more market conditions in the analytical models. Recognizing that retailers set (control) the prices of both national brands and store brands, Mills (1999) identifies counterstrategies that are profitable to both manufacturers and retailers. This approach could be extended to explore the scope for retailers and manufacturers cooperating through the sale of national brands and store brands for mutual benefit.
5.2. Unsupported Results--Low R, Low E, and Low C
5.2.1. Discussion of Key Results. These results do not pass muster when tested for external validity. However, some results offer insights. Wu and Wang (2005) provide an interesting model that suggests that if the leading national brand offers the store brand (dual branding), then the retailer may demand less of a trade deal from the national brand manufacturers. Many national brand managers believed that store brand quality or cost would not significantly influence their wholesale prices because they are more focused on the prices of other national brands than on the store brands.
5.2.2. Future Research Directions. As stated in §4.4.2, research that identifies the antecedent and consequent factors of manufacturer dual branding is an important topic for future research. Furthermore, as retailers start to build a loyal segment through their premium private labels, it is important to understand the implications of premium store brands for national brand manufacturers.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we have reviewed the literature on mathematical models of national brand and store brand

competition. Specifically, we compiled 44 analytical results related to national brand and store brand marketing based on a review of 22 studies published between 1966 and 2006. These results are presented in the form of comparative statics in Table 1 for retailer strategies and in Table 2 for manufacturer strategies. We then assessed the external validity of the 44 results using three criteria--robustness, empirical support, and credibility. We provide a quantitative assessment of external validity by scoring the results on these three criteria and obtaining an REC score of external validity. The REC scores for the 44 analytical results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Key retailer and manufacturer results are discussed in §4 and §5, respectively. Important results and insights from this discussion are summarized below.
6.1. Summary of Key Results and Insights 1. An increase in price substitutability between
national brand and store brand increases retailers' profits from a store brand introduction.
2. An increase in store brand quality (leading to store brand loyalty or store loyalty) can increase the retailers' profits from a store brand introduction.
3. Higher levels of price competition between national brands and store brands increase retailers' profits from store brand introduction while higher levels of price competition among national brands decrease retailers' profits from store brand introduction.
4. Overall, national brand wholesale prices decrease with store brand introduction; however, retailers' margins on national brands increase with store brand presence.
5. Retailers' gross profit percent margins on store brands are generally higher than gross profit percent margins on national brands. However, retailers' absolute dollar margins on store brands may be higher or lower than those for the national brands.
6. Conventional wisdom that states that new brands should not enter an already crowded market does not seem to apply to the introduction of private labels. Research findings favor the introduction of a store brand when there are many national brands in the category.
7. The theoretical premise that store brands should price promote infrequently was met with broad disagreement from retail executives. The reasons for promoting private labels include (i) higher margins, (ii) the need to protect store brand turf, (iii) the need to generate trial and repeat of a store brand, and (iv) the desire to simply promote what customers want.
8. National brand differentiation, advertising, and quantity discounts may be effective counterstrategies to combat private label penetration, but slotting allowances would not be a viable strategy to prevent private label entry.

9. National brand coupons specifically targeted at private label consumers accompanied by regular price increases may be a profitable strategy for both manufacturers and retailers.
10. There is high external validity for the result that national brands offer larger dollar discounts than store brands; however, the evidence on the relative frequency of price promotions of national brands and store brands is mixed.
6.2. Future Research Agenda Based on our review (§§4 and 5), we believe the following research topics are important and germane for future analytical and empirical research:
1. Effect of retail competition on national brand and store brand marketing.
2. Store brand strategies in different stages of the product life cycle.
3. Dynamics of store brand competition with leading and secondary national brands.
4. Cost and strategic considerations for dual branding.
5. Conditions conducive for premium private labels. 6. Market characteristics that influence store brand prices and margins relative to national brands. 7. Reasons for private label price promotion. 8. Manufacturer strategies--especially those benefiting both manufacturers and retailers. Finally, our review pertains only to grocery products, because there is little or no research on nongrocery products such as appliances and apparel. Private labels are a major force in these markets as well. Would the results for nongrocery products be different from the ones specified above? Future research could study market structures in nongrocery settings.
6.3. Limitations The method used in compiling and scoring the results has several limitations. When compiling the results, where the authors did not clearly state the analytical results or the intuition, we used our best judgment. We may have missed some results or modified the

intuition to some extent. We may also have inadvertently omitted some studies pertinent for this review.
We operationalized robustness based on market conditions that were generally deemed pertinent (Table 3). We did not include certain market conditions such as the presence of a wholesaler, nor could we include specific parametric conditions for which the analytical results were shown to hold. More conditions can be incorporated.
Because of the difficulty of obtaining data on the parameters considered in the analytical results, many empirical studies provided only indirect evidence. Hence, there was some subjectivity (we tended to be more inclusive) in mapping the empirical studies to the particular analytical result. Furthermore, because of the paucity of empirical studies and lack of adequate study-related information, we could not use formal meta-analytic approaches for integrating the empirical results. We computed the empirical support score using an unweighted count approach (net number of studies supporting the result).
Finally, our credibility scores come directly from managers (potential end users). Thus, this project serves as a bridge between scholars and practitioners. However, the relatively low response rate limits the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of managers. Future research can address some of these concerns and update researchers and managers on the progress made in the analysis of national brand and store brand competition.

E46 (S) E39, E47 (K)

When conditions are conducive for store brands, the higher the category sales, the greater the profit incentive for a retailer to introduce a store brand.

Retailers gain profits from the sale of their store brands. Store brand gross profit equals category sales × SB market share × SB gross margin. For given SB margins and SB shares, higher category sales implies higher profitability for the retailer to cover fixed costs and earn profits.

Retailer's margin and profits on the national brand increases with the introduction of a close store brand substitute.

When a close store brand substitute is introduced, because of increased competitive pressure, both the wholesale price and the retail price of national brand go down. However, the decrease in retail price is less than the decrease in wholesale price, with the result that the retail margin on the national brand increases.

Because the national brand faces increased competition from the store brand, retailers' margin and profits on the national brand also go down.

When a private label is viable, retailers' gross dollar profit margin on private labels is generally greater than the retailer's gross dollar profit margin on national brands.

Double marginalization (i.e., having to pay the wholesale price to the manufacturer) squeezes the retailer's margins on national brands. However, because store brands are generally directly obtained from the supplier, there is no double marginalization; hence, the retail margins are higher on the private label.

Cost permitting, it is more profitable for a retailer to target the leading (#1 share) national brand than to target the #2 or #3 national brands.

When a store brand targets the leading national brand, the retailer is able to extract better terms of trade, thus lowering wholesale price and increasing retail margin on the national brand. In addition, by targeting the high-share brand, the retailer sells greater quantities of the store brand, thus increasing profits from both the national brand and the store brand.
