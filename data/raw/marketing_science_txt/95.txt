Abstract. This paper studies probabilistic selling for vertically differentiated products, whereby consumers do not know the exact identity of a product until after making the purchase. An important feature of probabilistic selling overlooked by previous literature is that it changes the product line, which often determines consumers' choice context. Our work discovers the crucial role of context effects taking into account consumers' salient thinking behavior: consumers focus their limited attention on and hence overweight the salient attribute of a product in their perception, leading to context-dependent preferences. We show that probabilistic selling can improve the seller's profit with salient thinkers even when this strategy does not emerge with rational consumers. With salient thinking, the probabilistic product enables the seller to transform the consumers' choice context favorably and direct their attention to quality. Our findings demonstrate the importance of exploiting consumers' salient thinking behavior and suggest that probabilistic selling, as a context management tool, can be more beneficial than previously shown.

1. Introduction
Recently, many companies are utilizing a unique selling strategy, which assigns consumers a product in a probabilistic manner. For example, Thrifty has one "Smart Bet, Wild Card" program.1 With this program, consumers can obtain a compact car or a larger one at the same rate charged for the compact car, advertised as a "special car" on Hotwire (Figure 1(a)). For online retailing, Massdrop.com offers a grab bag containing different versions of earphones, whereby each consumer receives a product randomly assigned by the seller on the basis of a preannounced probability at the same price of the lowest-end earphone (Figure 1(b)).2 In the hotel industry, a deeply discounted Run of House room is a virtual room whereby the customer books a generic or unspecified room within a hotel with the possibility of being assigned to any room type (e.g., ocean-view or not).3 In the internet broadband service industry, a provider offers two levels of service, Gold and Palladium. The Gold service has a guaranteed download speed of 50 Mbps with a price

of $59.95, whereas the Palladium service with a price of $49.95 offers a download speed varying between 20 Mbps and 50 Mbps (Zhang et al. 2015).
In the above examples, these products exhibit characteristics of a vertically differentiated market; that is, all consumers prefer a high-quality product (e.g., ocean-view room) to a low-quality product given the same prices. These firms also offer a synthetic product, known as probabilistic product, which consists of a lottery among different quality-differentiated products.4 That is, consumers do not know which component product (either high or low-quality product) they will receive before the nonrefundable payment is made. Following the term coined by Fay and Xie (2008), we refer to the practice of offering the probabilistic product as probabilistic selling. An important feature of probabilistic selling is that the introduction of probabilistic products can change consumers' local choice context. Behavioral researchers have documented through experiments that when facing choices with multiple attributes, consumers evaluate each option by considering both its absolute utility and its relative standing in the choice

set, leading to context-dependent preferences (e.g., Huber et al. 1982, Simonson 1989, Drolet et al. 2000, Kivetz et al. 2004). A growing body of literature further shows that firms change their strategies significantly when consumers exhibit context-dependent preferences (e.g., Chen and Turut 2013, Narasimhan and Turut 2013, Azar 2014, Hedgcock et al. 2016). Given a product line, probabilistic selling enriches consumers' choice set by adding a synthetic product, and choice reversals may occur across contexts.
Interestingly, both Massdrop.com and Thrifty set the price of the probabilistic product the same as the low-quality product, and Run of House rooms have the cheapest rate. Why do the firms price the probabilistic products so differently? What role does the context-dependent behavior play in probabilistic selling? Indeed, to incorporate context-dependent behavior into probabilistic selling seems especially pertinent from both a theoretical and an applied perspective.
From the theoretical perspective, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind probabilistic selling in vertical markets is necessary to further explain this nascent strategy. Although others have focused on probabilistic goods in horizontally differentiated markets (e.g., Jiang 2007, Fay and Xie 2008, 2010, Jerath et al. 2010, Fay and Xie 2015, Fay et al. 2015), our work examines probabilistic selling for vertically differentiated products a` la Mussa and Rosen (1978) and is most closely related to Fay and Xie (2008) and Zhang et al. (2015). However, Fay and Xie (2008) sustain negative correlation in the values for the vertically differentiated products as in a horizontal market, which is different from the traditional literature on vertical differentiation. Indeed, negative correlation is the driving force behind probabilistic selling, which cannot arise under positive correlation. Zhang et al. (2015) consider two types of consumers, and thus the demand jumps at certain values of the

prices and remains constant otherwise. They find that probabilistic selling can be a way to profitably dispose excess capacity of high-quality products, which cannot explain why Thrifty adopts this strategy even in a short supply season. Additionally, in a market with a large population of heterogeneous consumers (i.e., a continuous valuation distribution), probabilistic selling never emerges regardless of the capacity constraints. Furthermore, all of the existing theories, including two recent behavioral papers (Huang and Yu 2014, Chao et al. 2016), cannot adequately account for this contemporary pricing strategy in practice: the compact cars offered by Thrifty seem trivial given that they are priced the same as the special cars, which could be a better car.5
From the applied perspective, it remains unclear how a firm should design and price the probabilistic product in the presence of context-dependent behavior. The extant theoretical literature has explored the optimal product line design when consumers exhibit context-dependent preferences (e.g., Orhun 2009, Dahremo¨ ller and Fels 2015). However, in revenue management applications and in the retail industry, the product line is fixed, and thereby sellers do not have much freedom to exploit context-dependent preferences. Because a probabilistic product is a convex combination of the high- and low-quality product, the seller can change the choice context by endogenously determining the "expected quality" of the probabilistic product, which is between the high and low quality. The positioning of the probabilistic product should take into account both roles of price discrimination and context management. Although this strategy is appropriate for a seller with limited access to alternate product variants, it is not readily apparent how the probability associated with the probabilistic product and corresponding prices should be optimized, given different possible combinations of the high- and low-quality product.

To model context-dependent behavior, we draw on recent work in the area of multiattribute choice and notably the concept of "salient thinking" as advanced in Bordalo et al. (2013). It has been suggested that consumers focus limited attention on and hence overweight the salient attribute in their perception (DellaVigna 2009, Fehr and Rangel 2011). The salience mechanism has explained a plethora of experimental evidence on context-dependent behavior of consumers, including well-established decoy effects (Huber et al. 1982) and compromise effects (Simonson 1989). Decoy effects pertain specifically to our motivation examples: the decoy (either an inferior or extreme option) plays an important role in influencing consumers' salient thinking, because its presence directs consumers' attention to the relative advantage of the dominating or superior product.
We build a stylized model of vertical differentiation with a continuous valuation distribution. Consumers may overweight the quality or price of a product when making comparisons, depending on whether its price or quality differs more compared with the respective market average. Absent salient thinking, the rational model advocates that the seller should not adopt the probabilistic selling strategy regardless of the supply capacity constraints, which departs sharply from the work of Fay and Xie (2008) and Zhang et al. (2015) (Section 3). The distinction lies in the assumptions of value correlation and consumer distribution. Specifically, negative correlation drives the emergence of probabilistic selling in Fay and Xie (2008), and the cannibalization effect is underestimated under a binary distribution in Zhang et al. (2015). By contrast, our salient model indicates that probabilistic selling can be used as an important context management tool to improve the seller's profit when the low-quality product has a higher cost/ quality ratio than the high-quality product (Section 4). Our work contributes to the literature on probabilistic selling for vertically differentiated products by discovering the pivotal role of consumers' salient thinking behavior and demonstrating that probabilistic selling might be more attractive than previously shown.
Further, we characterize the optimal probabilistic selling strategy in the presence of salient thinking. The seller meticulously designs the probabilistic product and sets prices so as to establish either the high- or low-quality product as the decoy with sufficiently high price/quality ratios and zero demand. We find that, when the cost of the high-quality product is relatively low, the seller offers all three products in the assortment. However, the low-quality product only plays a decoy role such that the highquality and probabilistic products are quality salient and used for price discrimination. When the cost of

the high-quality product is in an intermediate range all three products are still included in the assortment, but the seller instead sets the high-quality product as the decoy. In this case, quality is salient only for the probabilistic product. When the high-quality product has a relatively high cost, it should be excluded from the assortment. The seller would use the low-quality product as the decoy to boost the sales of the probabilistic product. These results have managerial implications on the design of probabilistic products for an existing product line in the presence of context-dependent behavior.
Recall the earphone example at the beginning of the paper. The grab bag is sold at the same price of the lowest quality earphone ($49), yet consumers obtain a higher-quality product with a probability of 62%, which seems to be a good deal for consumers, as discussed on the website.6 Thrifty uses a similar pricing scheme that the "special car" is priced at the same rate of a compact car. With aforementioned pricing schemes, consumers' attention is distracted from price as quality becomes more salient. These are examples in which firms profit from probabilistic selling, thereby creating a virtual product with quality salience for consumers. Note that probabilistic selling is particularly valuable when providing an additional midrange quality product is too costly or logistically impossible, because its implementation cost is negligible for online sellers. In particular, if the cost structure of the component products varies with advancements in technology or cost shocks in the short run, then the seller can easily adjust the associated probabilities and prices.
Our paper also belongs to the growing literature on context-dependent behavior, or broadly behavioral pricing. We refer readers to O¨ zer and Zheng (2012) for an excellent review on behavioral pricing and Bordalo et al. (2013) for a discussion about alternate approaches for context effects. We herein highlight the differences between the loss aversion model and the salience theory. Several models rationalize context-dependent choice by incorporating loss aversion relative to a reference point (see Tversky and Kahneman 1991, Tversky and Simonson 1993, Bodner and Prelec 1994). However, these models cannot reconcile their predictions with some experimental evidence concerning context effects, as reviewed in Bordalo et al. (2013). For example, because consumers avoid losses across all attributes, one prediction is a bias toward middle-of-the-road options, in contrast to the evidence that consumers do choose extreme options in many situations. As such, the formalization of context dependence based on loss aversion cannot give rise to the asymmetry of decoy effects (Heath and Chatterjee 1995): adding an appropriate decoy typically boosts the demand for

high-quality products but cannot work for lowquality products. As opposed to disappointment in the loss aversion model, salience captures the idea that choice is driven by attention. One would expect that the decoy induces consumers to focus more on the hitherto neglected upside of the target product instead of the painful disappointment of losing the target product that they expect to own. Because of its ability to accommodate a slew of disparate evidence and appealing psychological intuitions, we adopt the salience theory a` la Bordalo et al. (2013) in our setting. Based on the salience mechanism, our work contributes to the literature on behavioral pricing by substantiating an emerging practice in the internet age: probabilistic selling for vertically differentiated products, which is difficult to elucidate through a rational model.7
The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Model setup is in Section 2. We present the results for the rational and salient model in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, Section 5 concludes our work and provides directions for future research. All proofs are presented in the Appendix.
2. Model Setup
Consider a monopolist seller offering two vertically differentiated products, h and l, representing highand low-quality products, respectively. He also has an option of selling the probabilistic product, in which the consumer receives the high-quality product h with a preannounced probability of   (0, 1) and the lowquality product l with probability 1 - , as in Zhang et al. (2015) and real-life examples such as Massdrop .com. The focus of this paper is to examine whether and how the probabilistic product can be used as a context management tool. Consequently, we treat the design of probabilistic products (i.e., ) as a strategic decision variable for the seller rather than determined by the game interaction between the seller and consumers as in Fay and Xie (2008, 2015) and Jerath et al. (2010).
We use the variable p to denote the probabilistic product. Let ci  0 and qi > 0 denote the variable cost and the quality of product i, i  {h, p, l}, respectively, and qh > ql. We do not restrict our attention to ch  cl, and our model applies to damaged goods (ch < cl) as well. The expected variable cost of the probabilistic product is cp ch + (1 - )cl. We use ri to denote the selling price for product i  {h, p, l}. We assume that the seller does not incur any fixed cost of offering a product and min cl/ql, ch/qh  1 to ensure that at least one product is offered in the optimal strategy, as shown below. To ease interpretation, we define relative versus absolute strength, specifically that product i is relatively stronger than another product j if ci/qi < cj/qj, and product i is absolutely stronger if qi - ci > qj - cj (Inderst and Obradovits 2016).

We normalize the utility of no purchase (denoted by B) and the market size to zero and one, respec-
tively, without loss of generality. Absent salience distortions, a consumer with valuation  obtains a net utility ui() qi - ri from product i, where   [0, 1] denotes the consumer's heterogeneous willingness
to pay for the quality. The seller cannot identify the  value associated with each customer but knows the valuation distribution F() with density f (). Define ()   - (1 - F())/f (), also known as vir-
tual valuation in the literature on mechanism design. We assume that the distribution F() is regular, namely, ()/ > 0. This assumption holds for
many common unimodal distributions, such as the uniform, exponential, normal, logistic, and 2 dis-
tribution. Consumers are risk-neutral and the utility from the probabilistic product is expected to be up() qh + (1 - )ql - rp (qh + (1 - )ql) - rp. We can define qp  qh + (1 - )ql, which is a convex combination of qh and ql. It is independent of  and can be seen as the (expected) quality of the probabilistic
product.
Following Bordalo et al. (2013), we introduce a "reference good," whose attributes are the market average, denoted by (q¯, r¯).8 Thus, the reference good
is endogenously determined by the context (i.e., the
selling strategy). According to proposition 1 in Bordalo
et al. (2013), which attribute is salient essentially
depends on the relative difference of attributes, compared with the market average. Specifically, if qi > q¯ and ri > r¯ for product i, quality is salient when ri/qi < r¯/q¯, and price is salient otherwise; if qi < q¯ and ri < r¯, then price is salient when ri/qi < r¯/q¯, and quality is salient when the converse holds strictly.
Because salient consumers overweight the most
salient attribute when evaluating a product, we spec-
ify that the nonsalient attribute is discounted by some
scale factor. In other words, quality salience induces
consumers to become less price sensitive (i.e., overvalue
the product), whereas price salience makes consumers
undervalue the product. Formally, the perceived utility from (qi, ri) is

 qi - ri if quality is salient;

usi ()



qi - ri qi - ri

if price is salient; if equally salient,

(1)

where the superscript s reflects the distortion by salience, and the parameter   (0, 1] captures the severity of salient thinking.9 A lower value of  indicates more severe distortion by salience. When  1, con-
sumers behave rationally. Consistent with Bordalo et al.
(2012, 2013), we assume that all the consumers have
the same level of salient thinking for simplicity. Let Di(S) denote the demand proportion for product
i  S and S  {h, p, l}, which is the proportion of

446

Zheng, Pan, and Carrillo: Probabilistic Selling with Salient Thinkers Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 442­460, © 2019 INFORMS

consumers who purchase product i given the as-
sortment S offered. A salient consumer with valuation  chooses product i if usi () maxjS usj () and usi () > 0. In such a framework, demand proportions can be characterized by the valuation of indifferent
consumers (e.g., Pan and Honhon 2012, Chen et al.
2013). Let i be the indifferent consumer between product i and i - 1, where i has a higher perceived
quality than i - 1. Then any consumer with  > i would strictly prefer product i to i - 1 because usi () > usi-1(). We can obtain Di(S) as follows.

Di(S)



1 - F(h) F(h) - F(p

)

for i for i



F(p) F(l)

-

F(l)

for i for i

h; p; l; B.

The seller's profit is then (S) iS(ri - ci)Di(S) for a given set of products S. The seller's objective is to find S and the optimal selling prices ri for i  S such that the profit is maximized. Because there is a oneto-one correspondence between r (rl, rp, rh) and 
(l, p, h), we can also optimize S and . Note that S includes the decision of  if the probabilistic
product is present. The notation is summarized in
Table A.1 in the Appendix.

3. Rational Model:  1
When  1, consumers' perceived utility for one
product does not depend on the other products of-
fered by the seller (no context effects). Removing
product i from consideration in the assortment is equivalent to preserving it but setting a sufficiently
high price ri such that no consumer purchases it. Therefore, the seller can regard the retail prices r (rl, rp, rh) as the only decision variables when consumers are rational (i.e., nonsalient) thinkers. In this regard, S contains those products that have positive demands corresponding to optimal r.
Without loss of generality, we assume that prices r are set such that 0  l  p  h  1. As a direct result of the one-to-one correspondence between r (rl, rp, rh) and  (l, p, h), given any , we can rewrite the profit function as a function of  only, (; ).

(; ) (1 - F(h))[(h(qh - qp) - (ch - cp)]

+ (1 - F(p))[p(qp - ql) - (cp - cl)]

+ (1 - F(l))(lql - cl)

Hence, the seller's profit maximization problem is

max (; )


s.t. 0  l  p  h  1.

(3)

Obviously, if no probabilistic products are offered for any given  in (3), probabilistic selling should not be adopted. Surprisingly, in contrast to the literature, we

find that with rational consumers, probabilistic selling does not improve the seller's profit for vertically differentiated products, as shown in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. When consumers are rational, probabilistic selling is never optimal, and the optimal strategy is as follows:

On the one hand, the probabilistic product enhances

price discrimination by segmenting consumers more

effectively (price discrimination effect). On the other

hand, the availability of a probabilistic product might

encourage some consumers who were planning to

purchase a high-quality product to save money by

purchasing the probabilistic product instead. Spe-

cifically, the introduction of the probabilistic prod-

uct would cannibalize the high profit margin that

the seller can obtain from the high-quality product

(cannibalization effect). Because cp ch + (1 - )cl and

qp

qh

+

-

)ql,

we

have

ch -cp qh -qp

cp -cl qp -ql

, ch -cl
qh -ql

which

implies that the probabilistic product does not have a

cost/quality advantage over the high- or low-quality

products. Therefore, the introduction of the proba-

bilistic product cannot improve the total profit be-

cause the cannibalization effect dominates the price

discrimination effect. Interestingly, under abundant

supply, Proposition 1 implies that the optimal selling

strategy depends only on the cost and quality of both

products but does not depend on how the consumer

valuation of quality is distributed: offering the high-

quality product only when the high-quality product

is relatively stronger than the low-quality product,

the low-quality product only when the low-quality

product is absolutely stronger than the high-quality

product, and both products otherwise. Note that this

result holds for any given quality levels, so that the

absence of probabilistic products cannot be attributed

to the assumption of exogenously given quality levels.

Moreover, as shown in the proof of Proposition 1, the qualitative result that probabilistic selling is never optimal still holds for any level of supply. This robust result is in stark contrast to the findings of Zhang et al. (2015), where the probabilistic product is offered along with the high- (and low-) quality products in the optimal strategy; that is, S {h, p, l} or {h, p}. They assume, however, two discrete types of consumer in the market: high valuation and low valuation. The demand of each product changes (jumps) at the price that equals to the value of the discrete consumer valuation of the high- or lowquality products only, and is constant otherwise.

A necessary condition in their paper for probabilistic selling to emerge is that the seller has excess capacity of the high-quality product. The seller can dispose of excess capacity by creating probabilistic products that only target low-valuation consumers. The introduction of the probabilistic product does not affect the high-valuation consumers' demand for the high-quality product because only low-valuation consumers would purchase the probabilistic product as long as the incentive compatibility constraints are satisfied. That is, the cannibalization effect is limited. In our model, consumer valuation follows a continuous distribution, and the demand of each product continuously responds to a price change. Consequently, some consumers who were going to purchase the high-quality product switch to the probabilistic product if it is offered, which entails significant cannibalization so that the seller would not offer the probabilistic product.
The insights from Zhang et al. (2015) are applicable when the valuation distribution is bimodal; for example, consumers come from two separating sources (e.g., home and business sectors). Then, probabilistic selling could improve the profit by disposing the excess supply of the high-quality products. In a market with a large population of heterogeneous consumers, however, the demand continuously responds to any gradual change in price, and thus their insights are inapplicable. We find that probabilistic selling cannot improve the seller's profit when the valuation of fully heterogeneous consumers follows a continuous distribution.
Fay and Xie (2008) focus on horizontally differentiated products and show that probabilistic selling allows the seller to segment a market. Consequently, the seller can raise the selling prices of the component products to extract high surplus from consumers with strong preferences and offer a discounted probabilistic product to attract consumers with weaker preferences. In addition, they find that this advantage of probabilistic selling holds qualitatively in a quality-differentiated market defined in their work. Similar to the classic model of vertical differentiation (Mussa and Rosen 1978, Maskin and Riley 1984), their model also highlights that consumers always prefer the high-quality product over the low-quality one if they are offered at the same price. However, a key distinction between Fay and Xie (2008) and the classic models lies in the characterization of the underlying preferences. More specifically, Fay and Xie (2008) avail themselves of a Hotelling style model, and under this assumption probabilistic selling can still improve the profit in the vertically differentiated market in their work owing to the nature of negative correlation in the values for the component products. In contrast, we adopt the classic model, whereby the values for the quality-differentiated products are positively correlated.

We show that the qualitative results concerning the advantage of probabilistic selling shown in Fay and Xie (2008) no longer hold when utilizing this canonical model of vertical differentiation.10
In summary, this rational benchmark demonstrates that the extant driving forces (Fay and Xie 2008, Zhang et al. 2015) for probabilistic selling would not arise in a standard model of vertical differentiation, which calls for a new theory.

4. Salient Model:  < 1
In this section, we incorporate the consumers' salient thinking behavior into the model. First, we consider a benchmark without the probabilistic product to identify a fundamental tension in a small assortment. Then, we show how to meticulously design the probabilistic product and determine the assortment so as to optimize the profit. Essentially, the seller has more flexibility to manipulate consumers' attention through endogenously determined salience by including the probabilistic product in the assortment.

4.1. Benchmark Without Probabilistic Products
The reference good associated with the assortment S {h, l} has attributes q¯ (ql + qh)/2 and r¯ (rl + rh)/2. The seller can change consumers' reference good by removing or adding a product in the assortment. In the rational model presented in Section 3, if a product has zero demand, preserving or removing it in the assortment does not change the results and implications. In contrast, in the salient model, offering the zero demand product could change consumers' reference good, possibly engendering different selling strategies. Before we present the optimal selling strategies, we first establish an important property concerning different salience relationships in Lemma 1.

Lemma 1. In the assortment S {h, l}, we have the fol-

lowing homogenous salience relationship for both products:

i.

quality

is

salient

if

and

only

if

rh qh

<

rl ql

;

ii.

price

is

salient

if

and

only

if

rh qh

>

rl ql

;

iii. price and quality are equally salient if and only if

rh qh

rl ql

.

By definition, price and quality are equally salient for any assortment containing only one product. Nevertheless, for any assortment with two products, Lemma 1 states that both products have the same salient attribute (i.e., they possess a homogeneous salient feature). The seller can offer either a single product ({h} or {l}) or both products ({h, l}). Note that we highlight the decoy product with zero demand in bold. Additionally, the assortment {h, l} could have three salience relationships depending on different prices. Through excluding dominated strategies, we can reduce the number of potential optimal

selling strategies as summarized in Lemma A.1 in the Appendix: {h, l}, {h, l}, and {l}, which stand for the strategy of offering both products with quality salience but the low-quality product serving as the decoy, offering both products with price salience and positive demands on both products, and offering only the low-quality product with equal salience, respectively. The corresponding optimal profits and prices are

cpe cqe as shown in Figure 2(b). Figure 2(a) and 2(c) show how the profits change with ch when  0.96 > ^ , where cpe > cqe > cqp and when  0.86 < ^ , where cpe < cqe < cqp, respectively.

Note that {l} is independent of ch and . Ceteris paribus, as  decreases, consumers' preferences are distorted more severely, impacting the profit under quality salience ({h,l}) and price salience ({h,l}) in an opposite manner. Specifically, under quality sa-
lience, consumers overvalue the high-quality product more as  decreases (positive effect). Thus the

Figure 2. Profit as a Function of ch with  0.96, 0.91, and 0.86 in Example 1

profit improvement from consumers' salient thinking is more pronounced and cqe increases as  decreases (see the formal proof of Lemma A.2 in the Appendix).
However, under price salience, the seller adopts a price discrimination strategy but consumers become more sensitive to price as  decreases (negative effect), leading to a deeper profit decrease; consequently, cpe decreases as  decreases. From Figure 2, we observe that as the salience effect increases (i.e.,  decreases), the range of ch where price discrimination occurs ({h,l}) disappears. Essentially, the optimal strategy depends on the relationship among cqe, cpe, and cqp, which are functions of . Proposition 2 summarizes the results formally.

Owing to the homogeneous salience relationship

between two products, price salience arises from the

second-degree price discrimination. Intuitively, when-

ever the firm screens consumers who self-select their

own favorite product, price has to be the salient at-

tribute so that the low-quality product can indeed

attract low-valuation consumers. A lower value of

 ( ^) indicates a stronger price salience effect such

that the price discrimination effect is dominated and

the seller would not adopt a price discrimination

strategy. When the cost of the high-quality product

is relatively low ( < cqe), the seller should offer the

high-quality product along with the low-quality prod-

uct, which serves as a decoy to induce consumers to

overvalue the high-quality product; otherwise, only the

low-quality product is offered. This analysis pro-

vides a new explanation for damaged goods besides

the traditional screening explanation (Deneckere and

McAfee 1996): Offering damaged goods makes the

consumers overvalue the superior product and thus

boosts its sales.

Instead, when ^ <  < 1, the price salience effect

is not strong, so the seller would adopt a price dis-

crimination strategy for the intermediate range of ch

([cqp, cpe]). Yet, this range of ch shrinks compared with

the rational counterpart (

qh cl ql

,

cl

+

qh

-

ql

) because the

price salience and price discrimination effects work

in the opposite direction. Hence, the price salience

effect constrains the seller's ability to implement a

second-degree price discrimination strategy.

The above analysis reveals that, in the assortment

with two products, salient thinking turns out to be a

double-edged sword, in that it not only enables the

seller to exploit quality salience when the cost of

the high-quality product is relatively low but also

leads to less profitable price discrimination other-

wise. Under price discrimination, the incentive

compatibility constraints cause the price attribute to

become more pronounced, making it less profitable

in comparison with the rational counterpart. In other

words, the coexistence of quality salience and price

discrimination is impossible, a fundamental tension

with only two products. Typically, retailers do not have

control over a product line but choose what products to

offer from a given set of variants developed by man-

ufacturers. Probabilistic selling avails the seller to al-

leviate this tension by creating a virtual product,

expanding the assortment, and further manipulating

consumers' preferences so that quality salience and

price discrimination could coexist, as shown in the

next section.

4.2. Consideration of Probabilistic Products
On the basis of the benchmark obtained in Section 4.1, we investigate whether probabilistic selling can arise as the optimal strategy. By the same token, the reference good of the assortment S {h, p, l} is (q¯, r¯) with q¯ (ql + qp + qh)/3 and r¯ (rl + rp + rh)/3. With the option of offering the probabilistic product, the seller has more flexibility to control the salient attribute for each product by setting different values of the price rp and the probability .
In contrast to the homogeneous salience relationship in the absence of the probabilistic product shown in Lemma 1, the salience relationship for the assortment S {h, p, l} can be heterogeneous, as illustrated in Example 2.

Lemma 2. It is possible for the salience relationship for S {h, p, l} to be heterogeneous.

Example 2. rh > rp > r¯ > rl

Suppose

rp

and qh > qp > q¯ > ql.

namely,

<

r¯ q¯

<

rh qh

,

we have the situation in which quality is salient for the

probabilistic product but price is salient for both the

high- and low-quality products.

Observing the change of the salience relationship, we next examine certain conditions under which the probabilistic strategy is not optimal.

Proposition 3. When the high-quality product is relatively

stronger

than

the

low-quality

product

(i.e.,

ch qh

<

cl ql

),

a

proba-

bilistic selling strategy is never optimal and S {h, l}

where no consumers demand the low-quality product.

Absent the probabilistic product, Proposition 2

shows that the seller offers both the low and high-

quality products (i.e., S {h, l}) when the high-quality

product is relatively stronger. In this situation, qual-

ity is salient for the high-quality product owing to the

decoy l in the assortment. Further, because the high-

quality product has a lower cost/quality ratio than

<

cl ql

),

price

discrimi-

vein as Proposition 1.

Therefore, offering a probabilistic product cannot

further improve the profit through either enhancing

price discrimination or inducing quality salience. This

result implies that the probabilistic selling strategy is

not effective for information goods, consistent with

the observation in practice.

However, when the relative strength between the

high- and low-quality product reverses, probabilistic

selling improves the profit, as shown in Proposition 4.

Let the notation {h, p, l} represent a strategy whereby

the low-quality product serves as a decoy, leading to

quality salience for all products. Denote {h, p, l} as a

strategy whereby the high-quality product serves as

a decoy such that the probabilistic product is qual-

ity salient whereas both the high- and low-quality

450

products are price salient. Finally, let {p, l} represent a strategy whereby the low-quality product serves as a decoy such that quality is salient for both products. As shown in the proof of Proposition 4 in the Appendix, only the above three probabilistic selling strategies can be optimal. Following Herweg et al. (2017a), we refer to such a decoy described above as an appropriate decoy good.11 To formally illustrate how the appropriate decoy good works, we next present the formulation for strategy {h, p, l} as an example.

that

Proposition 4 in the Appendix for more details. Note

that the appropriate decoy good receiving zero de-

mand does not influence the objective function di-

rectly but instead indirectly impacts the salient

attribute of other products. Solving the maximization

problem with this simplified constraint gives us the optimal prices and probability (rl , rp, rh, ) for strategy {h, p, l}.

Similar to the benchmark in the absence of the

probabilistic product, for any given , we define cqe, cpe, and cqp for ch such that {h,p,l}(cqe) {p,l}(cqe), {h,p,l} (cpe) {p,l}(cpe), and {h,p,l}(cqp) {h,p,l}(cqp), respec-

tively. The optimal probabilistic selling strategy de-

pends on the relationship among cqe, cpe and cqp, which

The price/quality ratio, ri/qi, plays a central role in

shaping salience and determining price discrimina-

tion. Comparing with the reference good (r¯/q¯) and

other products (rj/qj) respectively, we can determine

which attribute is salient and which product may

have positive demand accordingly. Because the ref-

erence good is endogenously determined by the

selling strategy, any change in ri and  would poten-

tially reverse the salience relationship. With more

products in the assortment, the seller has more flex-

ibility to select the appropriate decoy with zero demand

ingeniously to configure the price/quality ratio of the

market average and thus change the salience rela-

tionship to his favor. Meanwhile, the seller can op-

timize the price/quality ratios of the nondecoys to

implement price discrimination under certain con-

ditions. In other words, the products in the enlarged

assortment are partitioned into two parts: the decoy

with zero demand to influence the reference good

and thus the salience relationship, and the nondecoys

with positive demand to achieve price discrimination.

Therefore, probabilistic selling extends the seller's

capability to capitalize on both quality salience and

price discrimination. We next discuss each specific re-

addition to quality salience, probabilistic selling al-

lows the seller to implement second-degree price

discrimination on the probabilistic and high-quality

products by optimizing their price/quality ratios

(i.e.,

rp qp

<

rh qh

).

At

optimum,

the

price

of

the

probabi-

listic product is the average price of the high- and

low-quality products, but the probability is greater

than

half

(i.e.,

1 2

<

<

1).

As the cost increases (i.e., in the intermediate range

cqp  ch < cpe), the high-quality product is no longer

effective when offered alongside the probabilistic

product but can serve as the appropriate decoy with

a

sufficiently

high

price/quality

ratio

(i.e.,

r¯ q¯

<

rh qh

).

All

three products are still offered, but unlike the pre-

vious case, we have a heterogeneous salience rela-

tionship: quality remains salient for the probabilistic

product, whereas price becomes salient for the low-

and

high-quality

products

(i.e.,

rp qp

<

qr¯¯,

rl ql

<

qr¯¯,

and

r¯ q¯

<

rh qh

).

Compared

with

strategy

{h, l}

in

the

bench-

mark without probabilistic selling, price discrimi-

nation

is

still

sustained

(i.e.,

rl ql

<

rp qp

),

but

we

create

a

decoy effect driving more consumers to buy the prob-

abilistic product with quality salience. It is interesting to

observe that the price of the probabilistic product is still

the average at optimum as in the previous case, but the

associated probability is approaching one now. Another

interpretation of this strategy is misleading sales as in

Bordalo et al. (2013): the original price of a product on

sale acts as a decoy to increase the salience of its

quality. At optimum, because the probabilistic and

high-quality products have almost the same quality, the

probabilistic product can be regarded as the sale version

of the high-quality product. Misleading sales boost

demand for the high-quality product at the expense

of demand for the low-quality product, consistent

with the salience relationship here.

When the high-quality product cost is relatively

high (ch  cpe), it should be excluded from the assortment because it cannot act effectively as a decoy

or for price discrimination. Compared with the

benchmark in which only the low-quality product

is offered, the probabilistic product turns equal

salience into quality salience. Specifically, the low-

quality product is now offered as the decoy to ren-

der the quality salient for the probabilistic product

(i.e.,

rl ql

<

r¯ q¯

<

qrpp).

At

optimum,

the

seller

should

set

rp

rl and   0. Of course, the extremely high or low

probability associated with the probabilistic product

in theory can be implemented as, for example, 95% or

5% in practice. Note that although the high-quality

product is not available for purchase individually, its

specification information should still be present to

consumers so that they can perceive the quality of the

probabilistic product.

We next proceed to the scenario with severe salience distortion (i.e.,  < ~). The major distinction lies in the profitability of strategy {h, p, l} when cqp  ch < cpe. Recall that the probabilistic product is quality salient but the low-quality product is price salient when the high-quality product serves as the decoy. With salient thinking being more severe (i.e.,  is lower), the negative effect of price salience would overrun the benefit of price discrimination and quality salience, making the strategy {h, p, l} suboptimal. Therefore, whether the high-quality product can serve as a decoy at optimum depends on the level of consumers' salient thinking. Put differently, when  < ~, the only strategy with a heterogeneous salience relationship (i.e., {h, p, l}) cannot be optimal, and thereby at optimum, the seller always sustains a homogeneous salience relationship, namely, quality salience no matter what products are offered. Interestingly, we observe that, regardless of the strength of salient thinking and cost structure, the optimal assortment always includes the low-quality product, which may not be purchased by any consumer.

Lemma 3. The low-quality product is always offered (i.e., l  S).

Conventional wisdom in assortment planning sug-

gests that the seller should not provide the lowest-

quality product when it does not own any cost/quality

advantage relative to other products (for example,

when

ch qh



cl ql

as

shown

in

Proposition

1).

By

contrast,

in

the presence of salient consumers, the lowest-quality

product should always be included in the assortment.

Apart from the role of price discrimination under

certain conditions, the lowest-quality product is most

effective to serve as a decoy. Further, from Proposition 4,

we have the following lemma concerning the prob-

abilistic product.

Lemma 4. The probabilistic product never serves as the decoy. Moreover, quality is always salient for the probabilistic product.

Lemma 4 indicates that the probabilistic product, as a virtual product with intermediate quality, is actually not effective to serve as a decoy. Instead, the seller should tilt consumers' attention to the quality attribute of the probabilistic product, which then is perceived as a "good deal" relative to the decoy.

Example 3 (Continued from Example 1). Suppose  0.92.

We consider the optimal strategy for four instances

corresponding to ch 4, 8, 27, 40, respectively. Table 1 lists the optimal solutions in the presence and absence

(benchmark) of the probabilistic product and the mag-

nitude of the profit advantage from probabilistic selling.

in Proposition 27 < cpe, and ch

4(i) (i.e., 40 > cpe,

qh cl ql

8 < cqp, cqp < ch

respectively). Compared

with the benchmark, probabilistic selling enables the

seller to take an additional advantage of price dis-

crimination in instance (2) and turn price and equal

salience into quality salience in instances (3) and (4),

respectively. The decoy effect raises the seller's profit

significantly by 31.98% in instance (3) and 11.62%

in instance (4).

4.3. Discussion
A few remarks are in order. First, these results concerning the importance of consumers' salient thinking behavior on probabilistic selling extends beyond those immediately shown here. In Proposition 4, we demonstrate the impact of salience based on regular distributions of consumer valuation. As a matter of fact, the salience mechanism also applies to discrete distributions as adopted in Zhang et al. (2015). A

necessary condition for the probabilistic product to emerge in their work is that the supply of the highquality product is abundant. Our salience theory does not impose any conditions on supply. In essence, probabilistic selling expands the set of candidate products and enables the seller to manipulate consumers' preference structure favorably by tilting their attention to quality without weakening the ability to implement price discrimination. This manipulation only depends on the choice context (i.e., the assortment) facing the salient thinkers rather than any operational conditions. Therefore, our noteworthy findings apply to settings in which a seller faces uncertain demand, capacity constraints, endogenous quality, or a general case with more than two component products. It is imperative for practitioners to re-evaluate the implications of adopting a probabilistic selling strategy in light of these salience effects.
Second, salient thinking provides different implications on the marketing mix decisions for probabilistic selling compared with other theories (Fay and Xie 2008, Zhang et al. 2015). In our paper, whether the

Zheng, Pan, and Carrillo: Probabilistic Selling with Salient Thinkers Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 442­460, © 2019 INFORMS

453

seller should offer the probabilistic product is contingent only on the relative strength between the low- and high-quality products. In addition, in stark contrast to Zhang et al. (2015), the low-quality product is always included in the assortment regardless of the cost structure in our model. At optimum, the probabilistic product is sold either at the average price (with a probability greater than half) or at the price of the low-quality product (with an extremely low probability). As shown in practice, this product mix strategy can be implemented easily, providing sellers a context management tool to exploit consumers' salient thinking behavior.
Last, it is worthwhile to point out the difference between the salience model and reference dependent models that incorporate loss aversion. An important implication of the loss aversion model is a bias toward middle-of-the-road options (e.g., a midquality probabilistic product), whereas the salience theory may predict that consumers prefer extreme options (e.g., a nondecoy). Consider a representative consumer with  1 choosing from the following three products of (qi, ri): (50, $39), (41, $31), (30, $20). Our salience definition suggests that price is salient for all three products. A rational consumer would choose product 1, yet the loss aversion and salience models would predict that this consumer chooses product 2 and 3, respectively, for most parameters.13 Therefore, re-examining the results on the basis of the loss aversion model in different settings, such as product line design, will be interesting for future research.
5. Conclusion
We study whether probabilistic selling improves the profit of a seller offering vertically differentiated products. Interestingly, we first show that adding the probabilistic product in the assortment cannibalizes the existing sales such that the profit decreases for any level of supply when consumers are rational. Next, we extend the model by incorporating consumers' salient thinking behavior. The seller can include the probabilistic product to manipulate the consumer's attention to a particular attribute. Specifically, when the low-quality product is relatively stronger than the high-quality product, the introduction of the probabilistic product leads to a higher profit through either enhancing price discrimination with an enlarged product line or mitigating the negative effect of price salience by transforming the salient attribute to quality for some products. Our findings provide a new rationale for this novel selling strategy: consumers' salient thinking. We show that probabilistic selling could be more attractive than previously exhibited in the literature when considering the effects of salience.

Our results also have important implications for the design of probabilistic products and assortment planning. The seller can establish either the high- or low-quality product as the decoy with sufficiently high price/quality ratios such that its demand is driven to zero by meticulously designing the probabilistic product. Specifically, when the cost of the highquality product is relatively low or high, the low-quality product would serve as the decoy and quality is salient for the products in the assortment. When the high-quality product has an intermediate cost, it instead acts as the decoy such that quality becomes salient only for the probabilistic product, resembling a misleading sales policy. Moreover, these results are especially useful to a seller who does not control the product design decisions. A key benefit of the probabilistic product is that no supplementary fixed costs and lead time are incurred with the design and physical production of the probabilistic goods.
For future study, we provide several interesting directions. First, in some business situations (e.g., car rental and hotel industry), the probability is not prespecified, and the seller assigns the component product according to the product availability at the consumption time. An analysis of this characteristic would shed light on revenue management techniques appropriate for addressing dynamic capacity issues. Another extension could address the possibility of endogenizing the choice of the quality levels in the presence of salient thinking. For a market with homogeneous consumers, Herweg et al. (2017b) show that a manufacturer always under-invests quality when competing against a competitive fringe. In a rational model a` la Mussa and Rosen (1978) with two types of consumers (i.e.,   {h, l}), it is well known that the monopolist either offers the standard screening contract or targets on consumer segments of high valuation h only. In the salient thinking model, Herweg et al. (2017b) show that the monopolist may also offer a pooling contract whereby all the consumers are served with a single product when the high-type consumer segment is not large enough. Moreover, together with a single target product having positive sales, the monopolist always offers a decoy good so that consumers would overvalue the quality and have a higher willingness to pay. It would be interesting to investigate product line design with salient thinking behavior in a market with fully heterogeneous consumers.

Appendix. Notation and Proofs For ease of illustration in the subsequent optimization problem, we introduce additional notation of salience function.
Definition A.1. Salience function s(·, ·) is a symmetric and continuous salience function satisfying the following properties.
Ordering: s(x, y) < s(x , y ) if [x, y]  [x , y ] for any x, y, x , y  R+;
Homogeneity of degree zero: s(x, y) s(x, y) for any  > 0 with s(0, 0) 0.
The two properties imply diminishing sensitivity and further induce proposition 1 in Bordalo et al. (2013), a central result in the salience mechanism. We refer readers to their seminal paper for psychological motivations. Therefore, the salience of quality and price for a product i is given by s(ri, r¯) and s(qi, q¯), respectively. Utilizing this nomenclature, we state that quality is salient for product i if and only if s(ri, r¯) < s(qi, q¯), price is salient for product i if and only if s(ri, r¯) > s(qi, q¯), and price and quality are equally salient if and only if s(ri, r¯) s(qi, q¯).
Proof of Proposition 1. We prove the result for a general case with any level of supply. The corresponding model is
max (; )

s.t. 0  l  p  h  1 Dh + Dp  kh Dl + (1 - )Dp  kl,
where kh and kl are the capacity of the high- and low-quality products, respectively. The last two constraints ensure that the demand for the each quality product does not exceed the corresponding supply. Note that ki 1 corresponds to the unlimited supply case because the demand for each product is bounded by one.

The seller maximizes the profit function (2), subject to the constraints:

For the case with kh kl 1 (i.e., under abundant supply), we obtain the optimal solutions as shown in (4). The simplified KKT conditions imply that the products in the optimal assortment must have strictly increasing ratios of cost differential to quality differential in the quality levels, consistent with lemma 5 in Pan and Honhon (2012). Moreover, the seller's optimal strategy depends on the cost/quality ratios only.

Lemma

1.

For

part

(i),

when

rh qh

<

rl ql

,

we

have

rh qh

<

r¯ q¯

<

rl ql

.

Therefore,

quality

is

salient

for

both

products.

In

a

similar vein, we can obtain part (ii) and (iii). 

Lemma A.1. i. For strategy S {h, l}, a. the seller can maximize the profit by optimally setting the
prices such that quality is salient and no consumers desire the lowquality product for any  (i.e., {h, l}) and

(h) {h,l}

and l > h,

b. the seller can maximize the profit by optimally setting the

prices such that price is salient and both products have a positive

demand

ch -cl qh -ql

<

(i.e.,

{h, l}),

and

(l )

cl ql

and

(h)

ch - cl (qh - ql)

,

{h,l} (1 - F(h))[h(qh - ql) - (ch - cl)]

+ (1 - F(l ))(l ql - cl) and

{h,l} ch

< 0.

c. this strategy is never optimal when price and quality are equally salient.
ii. Strategy S {h} with equal salience is never optimal. iii. For strategy S {l} with equal salience, the seller can maximize the profit by optimally setting the price of the low-quality product such that

(l )

cl , ql

{l}

(1 - F(l ))(l ql - cl) and

{l} ch

0.

Proof of Lemma A.1. The proof is organized according to

different salience relationships.

1. When quality is salient (i.a), from Lemma 1, we have

rh qh

<

rl ql

and

thus

rh qh

<

rl ql

;

that

is,

l > h.

Therefore,

no

con-

sumers demand the low-quality product, but it is still offered

along with the high-quality product because it renders the

quality salient for the high-quality product and consumers

overvalue

the

quality

qh 

.

Consequently,

the

seller

can

charge

a

higher price on the high-quality product compared with the

case without the low-quality product. The seller maximizes

the following problem:

{h,l}()

(1 - F(h))

hqh 

-

ch

,

subject to the constraints: l > h. Then we have

(h)

ch qh

and l > h.

By

the

envelope

theorem,

{h,l} ch

-(1 - F(h)) < 0.

subject to the constraints: l < h < 1. Then we have

(l )

that

is,

no

con-

sumers purchase the high-quality product but price is still

salient. Then we have the following problem:

{h,l}() (1 - F(l))(lql - cl).

The optimal solution is

(l )

cl ql

and (h) > 1.

In summary, we can set the prices such that:

(l )

cl ql

and (h)

ch - cl (qh - ql)

,

and the corresponding profits are

{h,l}

However,

when

cl ql

, ch -cl
qh -ql

h > 1

and

no

consumers

desire the high-quality product. In this case, trimming off

the high-quality product would prompt more sales of the

low-quality products and thereby enhance the profit. In

other words, it is dominated by offering the low-quality

product with equal salience (iii) and thus can be excluded.

Note

that

when

<

cl ql

,

price

salience

is

never

optimal

be-

cause no consumers purchase the high- or low-quality

product.

3. When price and quality are equally salient, we have

three possible situations: {h, l}, {l} and {h}. If S {h, l} (i.c),

according to Lemma high-quality product

1,

we

have

rh qh

has positive

rl ql

and

demand

thus (h

only l).

the No

one would purchase the low-quality product, and thereby

it achieves the same profit as offering the high-quality

product only (ii). Therefore, the equal salience for S

{h, l} is excluded. Moreover, offering the high-quality

product only (ii) is dominated by offering both prod-

ucts with quality salience (i.a) because consumers overvalue

the quality and thus more consumers would purchase the

high-quality product.

After excluding the dominated equal salience with {h, l}

and {h}, we only need to consider the case of offering the

low-quality product only (i.e., S {l}) (iii). The seller maximizes the following problem:

{l}() (1 - F(l))(lql - cl).

Then we have

(l )

cl . ql

Obviously,

{l} ch

0 for S

{l} by the envelope theorem. 

Lemma A.2. The cost thresholds changes with  in the op-

posite

direction:

cqe 

<0

and

cpe 

> 0.

Proof of Lemma A.2. cqe() is the solution to the implicit

function {h,l}(cqe; ) {l}. By the implicit function theorem, we

have · + {h,l} cqe
cqe 

{h,l} 

0.

Because

{h,l} cqe

<0

from

Lemma

A.1

and

{h,l} 

- (1-F(h))hqh
2

<0

by

the

envelope

theorem,

we

have

cqe 

< 0.

In

a

similar

vein,

we

can

obtain

cpe 

> 0.



Proof of Proposition 2. In the we have {h,l}(ch) > {h,l}(ch)

If

cpe < cqe, then there is no intersection point between {h,l}(ch)

and {h,l}(ch) in that range; if cpe > cqe, then {h,l}(ch) and

{h,l}(ch) intersect only once in that range at cqp, that is,

{h,l}(cqp) {h,l}(cqp). Because cpe(^ ) cqe(^ ), according to

the price discrimination on any two or three products is not

implementable

because

ch qh

<

cp qp

<

cl ql

,

and

thus

offering

all

the

three products even with one product as a decoy cannot

improve the profit. 

Proof of Proposition 4. We first characterize the locally

optimal probabilistic selling strategy when the low-quality,

high-quality, and probabilistic product serve as the decoy,

respectively, and then identify the globally optimal strategy.

Note

that

the

subsequent

analysis

focuses

on

i. The low-quality product serves as a decoy. We have two

probabilistic selling strategies: (a) {h, p, l}, both the probabilistic

and high-quality products have positive demands, and (b) {p, l},

only the probabilistic product has a positive demand.

a. The profit maximization problem with both the prob-

abilistic and high-quality products having positive demands

({h, p, l}) is stated as follows.

max (rh, rp, ) (1 - F(h))[(h(qh - qp)/ - (ch - cp)]
r,

+ (1 - F(p))(pqp/ - cp)

s.t. s(qh, q¯) > s(rh, r¯) s(qp, q¯) > s(rp, r¯) max{ush(), usp()}  usl (),   [0, 1]
0 < p < h < 1

(A.6) (A.7) (A.8) (A.9)
(A.10)

Constraints (A.7) and (A.8) ensure that quality is salient for the high-quality and probabilistic product, respectively. Constraint (A.9) ensures that no consumer indeed buys the decoy good (i.e., the low-quality product) when all three products are offered. Constraint (A.10) ensures that both the probabilistic and high-quality products have positive demands.
As suggested in Herweg et al. (2017a), we observe a defining feature in the optimization problem, which helps to solve it without using the traditional KKT conditions: the decision variable (i.e., rl) associated with the decoy (i.e., product l) only plays a role in the constraints, and thereby we can manipulate it so as to extend the feasible region of other decision variables as large as possible. The salience relationship defined by the price/ quality ratio enables us to reformulate constraints (A.7) to (A.10) as follows, respectively.

rh qh

rp < qp

rp < rh , qp qh

which is equivalent to

rp qp

rh qh

<

r¯ q¯

<

rl ql

and  >

1. 2

(A.11)

As we can see from condition (A.11), quality is also salient
for the low-quality products, and we have rh > rp > r¯ > rl and qh > qp > q¯ > ql. For an appropriate decoy product l, we

can manipulate rl, which should be as large as possible (i.e., raising qr¯¯) but still bounded by rl  2rp - rh as r¯  rp. Therefore, we can set rl 2rp - rh and then r¯ rp. Condition (18) reduces to

rh qh

<

rp q¯

<

2rp - rh , ql

i.e.,

rpql 2rp - rh

Therefore, we need to have

Constraint (A.18) makes sure that only the probabilistic

product has a positive demand when both the low-quality

ensures that some consumers desire the probabilistic prod-

ii. The high-quality product serves as a decoy. The pos-

to solve the following profit maximization problem when the

high-quality product serves as a decoy.

Constraint (A.21) ((A.22)) ensures that quality (price) is

salient for the probabilistic (low-quality) product. Con-

straint (A.23) makes sure that no consumer indeed buys

the decoy good (i.e., the high-quality product) when all

three products are offered. Constraint (A.24) implies that

both the low-quality and probabilistic products have

positive demands. Using the first order conditions, we can

obtain the optimal value of  and then

solution rp() the optimal 

and rl () for by examining

any given the change

of () with . In the absence of the probabilistic product,

strategy {h, l} is optimal for [cqp, cpe], and thus () is in-

creasing in . Indeed, we can show that the upper bound of

feasible  approaches one.

To this end, we reformulate constraints (A.22)

and (A.21) as follows.

meeting

condition rh  2rp - rl as r¯  rp. Therefore, condition (A.25)

holds under the strategy {h, p, l} with   1 and rh 2rp - rl

as r¯ rp. Moreover, the probabilistic product dominates the

high-quality product because the probabilistic product is

quality salient with qp/ > qh and rp < rh, and thus no consumers purchase the high-quality product, satisfying

condition (A.23). In summary, we can set rh 2rp - rl for the decoy good h and   1 for the probabilistic product, which

can be regarded as an upgraded high-quality product with

an approximate quality of qh/. To show that this optimal selling strategy improves the profit over {h,l}, we consider the following suboptimal solution.

the

demand

for both products and the unit profit of the low-quality

product are the same, but we have a higher unit profit for

the probabilistic product because p(qp/ - ql) + lql - cp > h(qh - ql) + lql - ch. Therefore, the optimal probabilistic selling strategy improves the profit when cqp  ch < cpe.

iii. The probabilistic product serves a decoy. We next

show that the strategy is dominated by the above three

strategies: {h, p, l}, {h, p, l}, and {p, l}, and will be excluded for

further consideration. For the strategies with the probabi-

listic product as the decoy and without price discrimination,

the probabilistic product is offered only to make the high- or

low-quality product quality salient. Having the high- or low-

quality product as a decoy can achieve the same profit. On the

other hand, for the strategies with price discrimination, we

With

this

decoy, price is salient for the low-quality product, whereas

quality is salient for the high-quality product. However, this

strategy does not yield a higher profit than case ii, where the

high-quality product is the appropriate decoy.

the paper.

5 Huang and Yu (2014) assume that the probability of obtaining

component products when purchasing a probabilistic product is

unknown to consumers who have to utilize anecdotal reasoning to

infer these probabilities. Chao et al. (2016) consider a duopoly model

in which consumers would experience the potential postpurchase

regret because of the possibly assigned inferior products.

applications of salience theory in industrial organization.

8 Note that we put zero weight on the outside option and abstract it

away from the market average. This assumption does not change our

major results qualitatively (Bordalo et al. 2013, 2016).

9 As in Bordalo et al. (2016) and Herweg et al. (2017a), in the utility function (1), we omit the normalization factor 2/(1 + ) in Bordalo

et al. (2013) for ease of exposition.

12 Owing to the salience constraints (i.e., strict nonequality) or practical restrictions (i.e., 0 <  < 1), the optimal  can only be close to a specific value.

13 This result holds when the sensitivity to losses with respect to the reference point (i.e., (40.33, $30)) is greater than 0.125 (the sensitivity to gains is normalized to zero) and  < 0.95.
