In the original version of the paper "New Perspectives on Customer `Death' Using a Generalization of the Pareto/NBD Model" by Kinshuk Jerath, Peter S. Fader, and Bruce G. S. Hardie (Marketing Science, Articles in Advance, May 27, 2010, DOI: 10.1287/mksc.1100.0568), some issues were brought to the attention of the journal by the authors after online publication in Articles in Advance. The accepting editor-in-chief, Steven M. Shugan, has chosen to retract the original published paper, allowing the authors the opportunity to resubmit a new paper that fully resolves those issues to the satisfaction of the authors and the journal.
