Abstract. Cash back sites are referral intermediaries that help retailers attract consumers and serve consumers through rebate offers. What exactly is the strategic impact of cash back sites on retailer pricing? We examine this by analyzing two competing retailers that use a cash back site to serve consumers, some of whom are loyal, some of whom are switchers, and some of whom are searchers. We formulate a multistage game by innovating on extant models of consumer price search and solve for the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium prices. We find that the cash back site can allow retailers to profitably eliminate consumer search and that makes retailer sites more sticky. Thus, cash back sites can act as strategic partners of retailers. Surprisingly, even consumers that use the cash back site can be worse off in the presence of cash back sites under some conditions. In particular, if search prevention is profitable even without a cash back site, then cash back sites result in higher prices to consumers. We also offer practical guidance through our finding that the optimal discount offer should be proportional to price rather than a flat sum.

1. Introduction
A common practice in e-commerce is for sellers to gain customers through affiliate sites. An affiliate site has links to the seller and when a customer is directed to the seller, the affiliate is compensated for "generating" the lead. The contract between the seller and the affiliate site could be pay per click or pay per sale, consisting of a commission proportional to the sale. The affiliate site serves as a way to acquire customers similar to search engine advertising. What is different is the way a potential customer is identified: the cue is not a search keyword but a visit to the site. Thus, how the site attracts visitors and whether visitors are sorted are key to the effectiveness of the site. In this paper, we study the strategic role of affiliate sites that attract customers with offers of rebates.
Online cash back is a new type of reward for consumers who make a purchase via affiliated links provided by cash back websites. Examples of such websites include Rakuten.com (original Ebates.com), BeFrugal.com, Coupon Cactus, Mr. Rebates, and LafaLafa.com. In practice, sites differ on the emphasis and implementations of cash back. Rakuten.com and Mr. Rebates can be thought of as pure cash back sites. Coupon Cactus, on the other hand, bundles both

coupons and cash back. BeFrugal.com positions itself as a more general portal. The cash back offers may also carry restrictions. In Appendix A, we display relevant pages from these sites that illustrate the specifics (Figures A.1­A.6). An interesting aspect of these sites is that a retailer may be found on all of them. For example, we see that Walmart appears on all sites, though the cash back rebate rate is not identical across sites. These sites often list more than 2,000 retailers, including large merchants like Walmart, Amazon, eBay, and Macy's, offering cash back. In 2014, Rakuten Inc., Japan's biggest online shopping mall, paid $952 million to acquire Rakuten.com. It was reported that in fiscal year 2013, Rakuten.com posted an operating income of $13.7 million on a net revenue of $167.4 million from its 2.5 million active members. Thus, cash back websites are an integral part of e-commerce.
How do online rebate websites differ from their offline counterparts? First, users of cash back websites can know ahead of time how much they can get back for each purchase at a specific retailer. In order to be listed on cash back websites, retailers have to negotiate a contract with the cash back site. After settling on all the terms, it may not be that easy to change the

amount of cash back frequently. Thus, frequent users of cash back websites could have a general idea about how much they can get by using online cash back. Second, because consumers make their purchase on the retailers' websites, unlike Groupon, for example, cash back websites invest little to provide customer support for each purchase. They are more like portals through which consumers can access additional benefits but at the same time have to expend some effort to do so. For instance, users have to log in as a member in order to use the affiliated links. Then they have to locate the link and go through it in order to be eligible for cash back. This effort can serve to profitably sort consumers. Third, the amount of cash back will be automatically calculated and recorded for each purchase. Technically, to get cash back, users do not have to do anything after shopping. Technology, such as browser extensions, allows the site to monitor each individual's purchase activity once he or she goes through the affiliated links. Extra effort is not needed in the postpurchase stage for consumers, so online cash back reduces uncertainty about whether consumers would really redeem their eligible rebates. That is a common concern that must be accounted for when modeling offline rebates. Finally, we should note that rebates on purchases at retailers are also available when consumers use certain credit cards for their purchases. Such rebates are determined by and paid for by the credit card issuing banks, not the retailer. Thus, these rebates appear to be part of the strategy of the credit card issuers. We study the situation in which the cash back sites are compensated by the retailer, so our emphasis is on the strategies of the retailer.
Another question that comes to mind is: what is the difference between cash back websites and shopbots studied by Iyer and Pazgal (2003)? We know that consumers can find suitably aggregated and sorted information, such as prices, by visiting online infomediaries or a shopbot and in this way reduce search costs. Viswanathan et al. (2007) study the potential segmentation effect of online buying services, that is, online infomediaries. What they found is that consumers pay different amounts for the same product depending on what kind of information they obtain. In particular, those getting price information obtain a lower price while those getting product information pay a higher price. Note that when consumers visit a cash back site, they cannot obtain price information but learn only the level of cash back for each retailer. In other words, consumers must still visit retailers' websites to obtain price information, and so comparing retailer prices entails costly search. Cash back websites do not directly affect consumers' search, so their strategic role differs from that of shopbots. Cash back sites can, however, help to segment the market

just as shopbots do in Iyer and Pazgal (2003). Do they have an additional strategic role?
Our goal in this research is to explore the strategic role of cash back websites. Our main finding in this paper is that cash back sites can make it profitable for retailers to limit consumer search and thereby increase the size of the effective loyal segment of consumers. Thus, the existence of cash back sites can serve to increase retailer stickiness. We also find that consumers using the cash back site can benefit from the discounts, but contrary to intuition, under some conditions they pay higher prices than what they would in the absence of a cash back site. Several questions arise naturally: How does online cash back affect price competition among retailers? What would be the equilibrium pricing strategy in this situation? Who benefits from having a third-party website that offers online cash back? Is it better to have a contract that specifies cash back as a percentage discount or flat discount? Is there an optimal cash back level? Are equilibrium transaction prices lower for users of the cash back site compared with a situation without these sites? In this paper, we develop a model of cash back sites, consumer search, and retailer pricing and, by analyzing it, provide answers to these questions. We also contribute from a modeling perspective by extending the models of Narasimhan (1988) and Stahl (1989) on competitive strategies by incorporating a segment of searching consumers that is absent in Narasimhan's model and a segment of loyal consumers that is absent in Stahl's model.
2. Literature Review
Although online cash back has grown into a large industry, there are limited past research findings. Ho et al. (2017) build an analytical model to shed light on the potential benefit of online cash back. They argue that cash back websites help to price discriminate consumers based on transaction costs that consumers must incur to become eligible for the cash back. They find that use of cash back sites is profitable for a monopolist only when consumer product valuation is sufficiently diverse and the fraction of low-valuation consumers is relatively small. In a duopoly, they show that when the merchants are asymmetric in valuations of the products, the low-valuation merchant has more incentive to use online cash back. This implies that it is more likely to see low-valuation merchants listed on sites, but casual observation fails to confirm that. Our work is different, because we do not model the merchants' decision to use a cash back site. We take as given that a cash back site can help segment the market, and then we ask whether retailers can enjoy additional benefits. It is tempting to think that the extra discount that cash back sites offer would make the competition among retailers

more intense. We find, counter to intuition, that if the segmentation is successful, cash back changes the nature of price competition and indeed retailers' profits are higher. Thus, the whole industry would benefit from having cash back websites in the marketing channel.
Vana et al. (2018) conduct an empirical study on the influence of cash back payments. They find that receiving cash back payments increases the purchase likelihood through the cash back sites in subsequent weeks. Besides, receiving cash back payments increases the size of the new purchase. They also provide an interesting discussion of possible explanations behind their findings. Ballestar et al. (2016) study consumer behavior when using cash back sites. They found that when the number of consumers increases, the total amount of transaction increases and consumers respond differently in different categories.
Online cash back is sometimes referred to as online rebates. There is prior work on offline rebates in the literature. Chen et al. (2005) argue that rebates are able to discriminate between consumers based on their postpurchase states. However, consumers will increase up-front willingness to pay when offered rebates. Lu and Moorthy (2007) compare coupons and rebates, pointing out that the uncertainty in terms of redemption cost for consumers is a key difference between these two promotion tools. Although both of them can act as price discrimination methods, rebates are more efficient in surplus extraction, whereas coupons offer more control over whom to serve. Moreover, consumers may underestimate the cost of redeeming the rebates at the time of purchase (Akerlof 1991, Kahneman and Lovallo 1993, Loewenstein 1996, Soman 1998). Empirical work includes Bruce et al. (2006), who show that in durable markets, such as cars, manufacturers can use cash back to reduce negative equity problem. Dogan et al. (2010) examine rebates both theoretically and empirically. Their empirical findings support the theoretical result that lower-end products benefit from rebates used to price discriminate in a competitive setting.
3. Model
We are interested in exploring whether a cash back site can help retailers to profitably limit consumer search by innovative pricing strategies. To this end we consider a market with two stores indexed by i, i 1, 2. They sell to consumers who are in the market for a basket of goods. In our model all consumers are willing to pay V for the basket but differ in their sensitivity to price. To simplify the calculation, we normalize V to 1. It is useful to think about the reasons for the heterogeneity in retail price sensitivity from a practical point of view. First, on a given purchase occasion a consumer may differ in the size and

composition of her planned purchase basket causing

the returns to price search to vary. Second, across

consumers, and possibly even across purchase oc-

casions for a given consumer, there would be dif-

ferences in the cost of time. Finally, although stores

are identical in our model, in practice, stores' as-

sortments would overlap, but not be identical, so

depending on the composition of the basket, the

returns to price search may also vary. Keeping these

considerations in mind we have chosen to model

heterogeneity in price sensitivity by supposing that there are three types of consumers.1 We modify

Narasimhan's (1988) model to capture consumer het-

erogeneity. We denote a proportion ,  > 0, of con-

sumers as being loyal to one or the other store, and

further

assume

that

each

store

serves

 2

proportion

of

loyal consumers. The loyal consumers buy from their

"preferred" store, or go-to store, if the price at the

retailer pi  V. It is useful to understand what store loyalty means. On a given occasion, because of the

composition of the basket and store assortment, some

consumers may wish to visit only one store. These

then are "loyal" to that store. Note that they may still

be price sensitive for the basket, as will become clear

when we discuss cash back sites. Consumers who are

not loyal in this sense are assumed to be one of two

types, depending on their cost to search across stores.

A proportion ,  > 0, consists of consumers with

zero search costs, corresponding to "switchers" in

Narasimhan's model, and buys from the lower priced

store. We label this the switching segment. This

segment can be thought of as extremely price sensi-

tive. Finally, a fraction ,  > 0, of consumers is as-

sumed to be moderately price sensitive. Consumers in

this segment go to the store offering higher expected

utility. Having arrived there, they stop search if they

see a sufficiently low price, reflecting their moderate

levels of price sensitivity. We denote S as search cost

and label the  proportion as the searching segment. It

is useful to see how our model is related to prior work.

Stahl (1989) studied a model with only switching and

searching segments as defined in our model, whereas

Narasimhan's model consists of loyal and switching

consumers. Our model consists of all three segments

and so can be thought of as a combination of the

models of Narasimhan (1988) and Stahl (1989).

An important innovation in our model is the pres-

ence of an online cash back website. Consumers who

visit the cash back site first and then subsequently

visit store i, using a link, become eligible for a dis-

count Di at store i usually on their entire basket. To see why our model of consumer heterogeneity in price

sensitivity that combines the Narasimhan and Stahl

models is appropriate for studying the cash back site,

note that the essential feature of a cash back site is to

offer price incentives. Moreover, the cash back site

746

represents competing stores on its site, making it more attractive to consumers who are not store loyal. Finally, the price incentives require a consumer to invest in time, provide private information, and receive rewards after the purchase. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that store loyalty and price sensitivity both matter in who would use the cash back site, and to what extent. We know from practitioners that not all consumers use cash back sites. We do not know the exact fraction of consumers that uses these sites, but it is thought to be well below 50%. The use of cash back sites involves a time cost due to the need to login to the site and possibly a cost due to loss of privacy. Thus, given our reasoning behind the three segments, it makes sense to assume that some loyal consumers would use the cash back site. Of course, the fraction of loyal consumers using the cash back site is likely to be higher if the discount were higher. Casual evidence suggests that, even for holiday shopping, nearly 33% of consumers patronize their "go to store" rather than shop around for the best deal on the Internet, based on Accenture's (2016) finding in a survey that only ". . . 67% of shoppers will purchase items from different stores or websites (than their usual go to store) to get the lowest price . . . ." These could be thought of as loyal consumers in our model. Price sensitive consumers are the most likely to use the cash back site given their extreme price sensitivity. What can we say about searching consumers? Because searching consumers are not store loyal, they can potentially avail themselves of discounts at either store and so are more likely to search than the loyal consumers, but perhaps less than the switching consumers. To keep the analysis tractable, we assume that switching consumers and searching consumers all use the cash back site. We capture the behavior of different segments depending on the level of the discount. Thus, in the presence of a cash back site, each store's loyal segment consists of two subsegments: those that use the cash back site and those that do not. In Section 5, we will specify the fraction of the loyal segment that uses the cash back site as a function of D. Our approach is that of a reduced form formulation of the loyal consumers' decision to use the cash back site. A fully endogenous representation would consist of a utility framework and a characterization of loyal consumers' expectations of prices of their store. Of course, these expectations would depend on the competing brand's strategy, in addition to own brand's strategy. We do not pursue this approach, which would complicate the analysis, and we think would not provide additional insights.
It is useful to think about the role of the cash back site. Note that the site does not display the prices at the stores. Thus, it is not a price comparison website. In our case, the cash back site informs consumers of

the discount and provides them with a link that makes them eligible for a discount. It will turn out that the equilibrium pricing strategy in our model is in mixed strategies. Therefore, knowing only the discount does not tell a searching consumer whether or not she should engage in search. That will depend on the price realization at the retailer.
We model the strategic interaction between retailers and consumers as a three-stage game of perfect information. In the first stage, retailers choose the discount. In the second stage, some consumers in the loyal segment and all consumers in the switching and searching segments visit the cash back site and become eligible for discounts. Furthermore, conditioned on the discounts, searching consumers choose the probability of visiting first each store, and retailers choose prices. Finally, in the third stage, searching consumers decide whether to stop search and buy from the first store or, as switching consumers do, continue to search and buy from the store with the lower discounted price. The retailers' decisions in two stages captures the reality that discounts are fixed over a longer horizon and prices are changed more frequently. This is analogous to airlines choosing baggage fees (negative discounts) that are fixed over time while prices vary. Next, we derive, in Section 4, the retailers' equilibrium pricing strategies when there is no intermediary in the form of a cash back site and in Section 5 in the presence of the cash back site.
4. Equilibrium Without an Intermediary
In the absence of a cash back site, equilibrium outcomes can be one of two types. In one outcome, the retailers' pricing is such that searchers do not find search profitable and so in equilibrium they do not search. Essentially, the pricing strategies are such that they eliminate search by searching consumers. This is basically Stahl's result. In the other outcome, the retailers do not find it profitable to eliminate search. Rather, they charge prices such that for a range of prices consumers search in equilibrium, but for a (lower) range of prices they do not search. So search is partially prevented. We consider each of these outcomes in turn to identify the equilibrium.
4.1. Outcome 1: Eliminate Search This outcome, were it to occur in equilibrium, can be characterized by extending Stahl's (1989) analysis with the additional condition  > 0. Of course, switchers buy from the lower-priced store. Searchers, on the other hand, first decide to visit one store. Given that the retailers are symmetric, searchers have no reason to believe that one store has a lower price and so we assume that half of them go to one store and the other half to the other store.2 A consumer that visits store 1 will encounter a price p1, and must decide

superscript denoting outcome 1. Note that consumers

Stahl (1989) has characterized the mixed strategy

Nash equilibrium that eliminates search. Stahl's anal-

ysis is based on  0, so we must extend his analysis

to the case  > 0. To characterize the equilibrium that

eliminates search, we must solve for the store's profit 1, l, p, and f 1, noting that in light of symmetry we

can drop the subscript i. Moreover, from Stahl (1989),

we know that equilibrium consists of a continuous function f 1 over [li, pi]. For the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we require that a retailer's profit be equal

for all prices in [li, pi]. Mathematically, this can be written as

Consider equality (2). The profit when a retailer
chooses the highest price p is given by multiplying the
price by the sales to its loyal consumers and the half of searchers who come to it first. This must be equal to 1. Similarly equality (3) says that the profit when charging l must also equal 1. Note, however, that at this
low price the store sells not only to its loyal consumers and the half of searchers who come to it first
but also to all the switching consumers. Finally, equal-
ity (4) says that when a store charges any intermediate prices the profit should again be equal to 1. In
this situation, the probability of selling to switchers is the probability that the rival's price is higher, given by 1 - F1(p). We also require that in equilibrium
search is completely eliminated. For this to happen
even when a searcher encounters the highest price

p, it must be unprofitable for her to search. Mathe-

matically, following Weitzman (1979), after simpli-

fication we can get

Lemma 1 is easy to understand. Preventing search profitably requires a sufficiently high search cost. For example, as the cost approaches zero, searchers' behavior resembles that of switchers, and preventing search is possible only if p is sufficiently small. But then this results in decreased profits from the loyal consumers, and so preventing search is not profitable compared with the security level of charging a price of V 1 to the loyal consumers. Indeed, if S is very high, search can be prevented even at p 1, the maximum willingness to pay.

4.2. Outcome 2: Searchers Search Partially
To solve for the equilibrium pricing strategies in this case, we must extend Narasimhan's (1988) analysis, because, unlike the switchers in Narasimhan's model, searchers continue to search at high prices and do not search at low prices. Thus, in contrast to Narasimhan's model, in which the relative size of loyal consumers and switchers is exogenous, in our model it can be thought of as being endogenous. As opposed

748

Qiu and Rao: Increasing Retailer Loyalty Through the Use of Cash Back Rebate Sites Marketing Science, 2020, vol. 39, no. 4, pp. 743­762, © 2020 INFORMS

to outcome 1, search by searchers is not completely

prevented in this equilibrium. There exists a price

point in the support, a reservation price, such that

if the searchers see a price that is higher than this price after arriving at the first store, they continue

searching. If on the other hand, the searchers see a

price that is less than or equal to this price, they would remain and purchase at the first store they visit.

We can use an approach similar to that of Gangwar

et al. (2014) and additionally incorporate the Weitzman's search condition to solve for the equilibrium of

this outcome. Doing so leads to a mixed strategy of the

type in Gangwar et al. (2014). It consists of two continuous functions fl2(p), p  [l, h] and fu2(p), p  [h, p], 0 < l; h  h; p  V 1 and a hole with f 2(x) 0, x  (h, h).

As before, we can drop the subscript i in light of

symmetry. Intuitively, the hole exists because the

expected sales are different at the two prices p h and

p h, which we will discuss later. The superscript 2 on 2 and f 2 correspond to outcome 2.

Consider equality (6). At p, the profit to each retailer

because

Thus,

the

profits

is

 2

And,

as

in

Narasimhan (1988), it is easy to see that the security

level is maximized at p 1, and equals 2. Equality (7)

says that the profit when charging l must also equal 2.

Note that equality (7) is different from equality (4). This

is because the store now has an additional source

of profit from those searchers who go to the com-

petitor store first but finding a high price, decide to

search and finally purchase at the focal store. This

additional

profit

is

To

complete

the

equi-

profit argument, we require that the profit at any

price p  [l, h]  [h, 1] also must be equal to 2. This

condition leads to equalities (8) and (9). Equality (8)

says that when the store prices above h, the searchers

who first come to it actually search. The profit from

these

consumers

is

because

only if the competitor's price is higher than the focal

to the competitor's store may stop search or continue

to search depending on the competitor's price. So the

be-

cause they buy only if the competitor's price is higher

than p. Similarly, equality (9) shows the profit when

the retailer's price is lower than h. Now, the half of

searchers who first come to it stop further search. The

other half of searchers who first go to the other store

and decide to continue search also purchases at the

focal store, because they only search when they find

the competitor's price to be higher than h and p 

h  h. In sum, equalities (6)­(9) represent the equi-profit

conditions for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Two other conditions must hold in equilibrium. The

first arises because the cumulative discount factor of

the mixing distribution must be monotonically non-

decreasing. In other words, f 2(p) 0, p  (h, h), and so

we have

()

F2l (h) F2u h .

(10)

We also require that in equilibrium h be such that

when consumers encounter a price below h, they do

not search. For this to hold, it must be unprofitable for

her to search when seeing a price p  [l, h]. Mathe-

matically, following Weitzman, after simplification

we can get

h

S

F2l (x)dx.

(11)

l

We can now solve for 2, l, p, h, h, and f 2 using the six conditions (6)­(11).

Lemma 2. When S < (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, there exists an equilibrium in which both stores allow search. Moreover, the

pricing strategy is given by the mixing distribution:

F2l (p) (p2-pll), if l  p  h

F2l (h) F2u(p)

The equilibrium profit is 2 2.

Proof of Lemma 2. We first equate (6) and (7) to solve

for F2l (h). Note that, according to our previous discussion, p is equal to V 1, because both stores max-

imize the expected profit in equilibrium. Here, we get

F2l (h) (+2(+l))l-. Next, we equate equality (6) and (8)

to get F2u(p) (6) and (9),
we can get

1 - 2((1-+p))p. Similarly, if we equate and at same time, plug in the value F2l (p) (p2-pll).

Now we are able to solve for h and h from F2l (p h) F2l (h) and F2u(h) F2l (h).

Two conditions are necessary for this equilibrium

to exist. First, it must be that h < 1, equivalently

+.

If

exist, because the searching consumers will never

equiv-

alently S < (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, where z 2+.

Can we rule out the possibility that h  h? We have

calculated h and h in (12). Note that the numerators are

identical. We can therefore compare the denominator

to get the relationship between h and h. From calcu-

lation, we have (+2)-2l(+2( +))-(2( +)-

l(+2) (+2( +))) (l(+2(+))-). We know,

by using the equi-profit conditions, that this value

will always be larger than zero, unless F2l (h) 0. In the equilibrium, F2l (h) is always larger than zero. 

The mixed strategy in Lemma 2 has an intuitive interpretation. First, it says that if search cost is sufficiently small, then complete search prevention is not a profitable strategy, because it would yield lower profits than the security level. So consumers search at high prices and do not search at low prices. Thus, the relative size of the segment of consumers who compare prices is a function of price and so the mixed strategy must account for this. This leads to a hole because the demand at the store has a jump decrease if the price p is higher than h. When a searcher sees a price like this, he or she would continue to search, and purchase at the other store with a probability F2u(p). Hence, the difference between the demands at the store when pricing at h and when pricing at h is larger than zero. This loss of the demand from searching consumers forces the store to increase price by a positive amount to maintain the expected profit at the same level. That is why we observe a hole in the equilibrium price distribution in outcome 2.

As we can see from Lemma 2, there is no analytical solution for l. So it is useful to briefly illustrate the equilibrium strategies numerically. Figure 1 does this. We present a numerical example with V 1, S 0.1,  0.25,  0.25, and  0.5. The dashed line corresponds to the hole where f 2(p) 0.
4.3. Equilibrium When There Is No Intermediary We can combine our results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 on the expected profits in the two outcomes, and determine the equilibrium depending on the parameters. We state this formally in Proposition 1. The proof is omitted, because the parameter regions are nonoverlapping, and so there is a unique equilibrium in each region.
Proposition 1. Suppose there is no cash back site. If S < (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, where z 2+, then both stores adopt strategies such that the searchers search partially in equilibrium; if S  (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, then both stores adopt strategies such that search is prevented in equilibrium.
The intuition behind Proposition 1 is as follows. Lemma 1 shows that when the search cost is extremely large (S  (1 - ln(1z+z))), the stores can prevent search without decreasing prices. In this case, their profits are higher than what they can obtain from the loyal consumers. As the search cost decreases, the stores still find it profitable to prevent search but in order to do that, they have to lower prices. Thus, there is a trade-off between preventing search to increase profit, on the one hand, and losing profit from loyal consumers by lowering prices, on the other. This is outcome 1. However, if the search cost is too small, the stores no longer prefer to prevent search, because the prices will be too low. In this case, they choose to allow search and the equilibrium will result in outcome 2. Moreover, their profits are simply the security level they can obtain from the loyal consumers.

Outcome 2 profits are lower than outcome 1, because search is not prevented in outcome 2.
Next, we derive the retailers' equilibrium pricing strategies when there is an intermediary who is a cash back site.

5. Equilibrium with an

Intermediary Present

With online cash back, a store can offer a "discount"

only to those people who use the cash back site. In

other words, the store is able to engage in price dis-

crimination, permitting the store to prevent search by

searching consumers without lowering the price to

consumers that do not use the cash back site. The

effect of this is different in the two outcomes identi-

fied in the absence of a cash back site. In outcome 1,

search prevention is profitable, and so with the ability

to price discriminate, stores would continue to pre-

vent search but could also obtain higher profits with a

discount strategy. On the other hand, if the equilib-

rium is outcome 2 in the absence of a cash back site,

stores must ask whether they can prevent search

profitably and earn higher profits. More important,

would that be part of a Nash equilibrium with stores

competing not only on prices but also on discounts at

the cash back site? That is the question we answer in

this section.

As noted earlier, in our model, all consumers in the

searching and switching segments use the cash back

site. Turning to the consumers in the loyal segments,

we model the fraction that does not use the cash back

site

for

store

i

as

consumers using

(1 - Di)2, the site.5

with the Thus, if

remaining Di 0, no

loyal loyal

consumers of store i use the site, while if Di 1, so that

there is a 100% discount, leakage is at a maximum and

all loyal consumers use the site. Our model of con-

sumers' use of the cash back site implies that as the

discount approaches 1, only a vanishingly small seg-

ment of consumers does not use the cash back site. In

reality, like loyal consumers, some searching consumers

also can be expected to not use the cash back site, and

stores serve these consumers too, and so to capture that

within our model we assume that both stores serve all consumers.6

As in the case of no intermediary, the equilibrium

turns out to be in mixed strategies. However, deriving

the equilibrium strategies is more complicated, be-

cause the game is now multistage and involves the

choice of both discount and prices. We wish to solve

for a subgame perfect pure strategy Nash equilib-

rium in discounts under complete information. Our

analysis proceeds backward by first examining the

second-stage equilibrium in Section 5.1 and then the

first stage in Section 5.2. We focus on second-stage

equilibria in subgames induced by first-stage discounts: D1 D2 D > 0 that are part of a symmetric firststage candidate equilibrium. Given our interest in search prevention, we derive in Lemma 3, the necessary conditions for second-stage search prevention to be a Nash equilibrium for the subgame.
Turning to the first stage, in Section 5.2, in Lemma 5, we show that if the search cost is not too high, then, in any symmetric Nash equilibrium, the first-stage discount must be higher than a minimum level, D. In Proposition 2, we establish our main result and show that if the search cost is also not too low, the profits from a discount strategy D1 D2 D leads to higher profits by preventing search in the second stage. Having established that the cash back site can increase profits, we elaborate in Section 5.3 on the implications of the presence of the cash back site. In particular, we discuss how it affects price paid by consumers, and its role if either searching or switching consumers were not present. Then, in Section 5.4, we establish subgame perfectness of the D in Lemmas 6, 7, 8, and 9 contained in the online appendix. This is an analytical result for a complicated game. To provide shaper insights, we illustrate the equilibrium in Proposition 2 through a numerical example and discuss the intuition behind our findings. Following that, we consider the case if S is large and provide a discussion of the equilibrium that obtains in this case with D < D, omitting a formal proof of subgame perfectness. We demonstrate subgame perfectness for this case through a numerical illustration.

5.1. Second-Stage Equilibrium

It will be convenient to work with the discounted

price to characterize the mixed strategies in the sec-

ond stage, so let us denote ppi to be store i's price after discount so that ppi (1 - Di)pi with pi denoting the undiscounted price. We only will be interested in

search preventing pricing strategies in the second

stage. This is because if the second-stage equilibrium

does not prevent search, then such a discount strategy

can be ruled out as a Nash equilibrium candidate,

because it would result in lower profits than the security level of 2.7 We define the effective loyal segment, denoted by , as consisting of consumers who

buy at the store they visit without comparing prices.

This includes two groups of consumers. One group

consists of the searching consumers who do not

search in equilibrium as well as loyal consumers who

use the cash back site. This group, in equilibrium,

pays ppi. The other group consists of loyal consumers

who do not use the cash back site. This group, in

equilibrium, pays pi the mixed strategies

Focusing on symmetric first-stage discounts, D1 D2 D, we will seek stores' mixed strategies of prices pp  [l, pp], pp  1 - D such that searching consumers

do not want to search at any price in the support.

and the resultant symmetric mixed strategies in the

second stage render the expected prices at the two

stores to be equal. Moreover, the continuation profits

in second stage from a search prevention strategy, given discount D in the first stage, 3(D), is

3(D) pp(D)(D).

(15)

Then Lemma 3 states the necessary conditions for search prevention to be the outcome in a symmetric Nash equilibrium mixed strategy.

both stores choose an identical discount, D. Then the nec-

Lemma 3 and its corollaries tell us how second-

stage equilibrium outcome depends on the first-stage

decision D when D1 D2 D, which in turn implies

that the effective loyal segments of the two stores are

equal: 1 2 .8 Note that if the conditions in Corollary 2 are satisfied, then pp  pp, and so in that

case the profit in the second stage is  pp. Moreover, pp

depends on  and the parameters. So the continuation

value in the subgame induced by D can be solely

expressed in terms of the corresponding . This key

point allows us to characterize the second-stage equi-

librium profits in terms of . Now, we can see from

12.

Therefore, if D < 12, a higher D results in higher pp and

higher  and thus higher continuation profits.

It is useful to elaborate on the intuition behind why

pp increases with D, up to 12.9 In our model, there are two groups of consumers who pay different prices,

with or without discount for the same basket. For

example, it is better to charge 0.8 as part of a strategy

with D 10% to people vising the site rather than

charge 0.8 as part of a strategy with no discount. The

reason is that one of the groups (loyal consumers not

visiting the site) is paying a higher price than 0.8, namely, 1-0.08.1. Moreover, as D increases, the price this group pays is even higher. If charging any price p is

more beneficial for a larger D, the price competition is

less severe. Hence, the price distribution shifts up-

ward, allowing for a larger value of pp. Note that if all

loyal consumers were to visit the cash back site, the

cost of preventing search cannot be reduced by making

consumers pay different prices and so the equilibrium

752

Qiu and Rao: Increasing Retailer Loyalty Through the Use of Cash Back Rebate Sites Marketing Science, 2020, vol. 39, no. 4, pp. 743­762, © 2020 INFORMS

outcome would be the same as what obtains when there

is no cash back site.

Turning to the case when D > 12, a higher D results in lower  because of "leakage" of loyal consumers

shrinking the size of the group paying the higher price

even though the price they pay relative to those who

use the site increases. Thus, the benefit of larger D is

actually diminishing and even could be negative if the

size of this group shrinks faster. This explains why

5.2. First-Stage Equilibrium Discounts chosen in the first stage must consider the consequences of attracting more searching consumers or deriving greater benefit from price discrimination or both. The discounts then determine how searching consumers decide to visit each store and also the stores' pricing strategies. If stores offer symmetric discounts in the first stage, then consumers visit each store with probability 12.10 Conceptually, the discounts can range from 0 to 1. We proceed by showing first that if the search cost is not too high, a symmetric Nash equilibrium has a minimum discount level, D. Lemma 5 proves this result by showing that in any candidate symmetric equilibrium with discount D < D one store can deviate profitably to D. This allows us to restrict our attention to possible candidates for Nash equilibrium. The proof of Lemma 5 invokes Lemma 4 in which we characterize searching consumers' choice of  if one store chooses D and the other chooses D < D. Our central result then is in Proposition 2 in which we identify the conditions on search cost S for a profitable discount strategy to be a Nash equilibrium outcome: search cost must be bounded from below in addition to satisfying the condition in Corollary 2. The lower bound on S ensures that search prevention results in profits higher than the security level. What is also interesting is that the D equilibrium has higher profits than any other candidate Nash equilibrium with symmetric discount D > D.

Proposition 2 establishes our central result that a cash back site can lead to higher profits by preventing search on the part of searching consumers even if such search prevention strategies are unprofitable in the absence of a cash back site. In other words, if equilibrium is outcome 2 with no cash back site, then there exist conditions under which a symmetric discounting strategy with a cash back site can increase profits by preventing search. Moreover, if profitable search prevention occurs even in the absence of a cash back site, corresponding to outcome 1, a cash back site can increase profits by preventing search with less leakage to loyal consumers. What remains to investigate is if such strategies are also subgame perfect. In other words, would one store want to deviate from the symmetric strategy identified in Proposition 2? Subgame perfectness imposes further restrictions, in addition to those identified in Proposition 2. The mathematical challenge is to characterize, for every possible deviation, the second-stage Nash equilibrium in the three-player game consisting of consumers' choice of  and mixed strategy pricing by the two stores that also satisfy search conditions. We discuss subgame perfectness in Section 5.4 along with a numerical illustration of subgame perfect equilibria corresponding to both outcomes 1 and 2. In Section 5.4, we also explore the equilibrium if search cost S is large. It is not possible to analytically establish sufficient conditions for subgame perfectness in this case. Nevertheless, subgame perfect equilibria exist, as a numerical illustration demonstrates. We then discuss the nature of this equilibrium and provide useful insights.
5.3. Discussion of the Results
Proposition 2 is our central result. An obvious consequence of the cash back site is the ability to sort consumers, in particular at least a fraction of the loyal consumers from the rest. What is interesting, however, is that this sorting can allow firms to prevent search by searching consumers and do so profitably. This is because the discount consumers can avail of at the cash back site accrues to only a fraction of the loyal consumers. In the absence of a cash back site all consumers face the same price, and if the search cost is not too high, S < (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, search prevention would not be profitable as established in Proposition 1. In such a situation, the cash back site that sorts consumers offers a way to achieve higher profits by increasing retailer loyalty or stickiness and preventing search by a segment of a store's consumers, because discounts are targeted at searching consumers. Of course, if search cost is high, S  (1 - ln(1z+z)) +, stores can profitably prevent search even in the absence of a cash back site. In this situation too, the cash back site can lead to higher profits by selectively lowering prices to searching consumers. We emphasize

that the cash back site need not be perfect in its sorting

function. Indeed, our result obtains in a model in which

the leakage of loyal consumers is related to the (lower)

differential price targeted at the searching consumers.

We can now ask who benefits from the presence of a

cash back site. Clearly retailers can benefit under the

conditions identified by us. Because retailer profits

are higher, the wedge between the profits with and

without a cash back site makes it possible to make the

cash back site also profitable. What is the effect on

consumers? Consider first the case in which stores

find it profitable to prevent search even in the absence

of a cash back site. So we have outcome 1. In this case,

all loyal consumers pay the same price as searching

consumers. On the other hand, in the presence of a cash

back site, only a subsegment of loyal consumers that

visits the site pays the same price as searching con-

sumers. So the effect of this increased loyalty makes

prices higher, and all consumers end up paying higher

expected price, even after the discount. Thus, we can see

that cash back sites may prove to be harmful to con-

sumers. This effect on consumers is counterintuitive, be-

cause we may expect cash back sites to always make users

of the site better off than if there were no cash back site.

We can also contrast outcome 1 finding with the

case of outcome 2 in the absence of a cash back site.

Outcome 2 prevails if without the cash back site, re-

tailers do not prevent search, and so prices do not

have to satisfy a restrictive search constraint. They

remain high. However, once a cash back site appears,

retailers find it profitable to prevent search. This

causes prices to be lower for consumers that use the

cash back site but higher for those that do not. In other

words, the sorting of consumers leads to a differen-

tiated pricing of the kind we would expect. The dif-

ferent consequences of the cash back site in outcomes

1 and 2 also can be verified in the numerical illustration

in the online appendix and discussed in Section 5.4.

It is interesting to explore the role of a cash back site

if the size of the switching segment  0, and so the

market has only loyal and searching consumers. In

the absence of a cash back site, a Nash equilibrium

consists of searching consumers visiting each store

with

probability

1 2

based

on

their

expectation

of

each

store's price to be 1; and stores' choosing prices to be 1.

This is a rational expectations Nash equilibrium exhib-

iting a Diamond (1971) paradox and occurs also in Lal

and Matutes (1994) and Lal and Rao (1997). Note that each store's profit is +2. What would happen if there were a cash back site? In this case, we can construct

the following subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.

second stage, stores choose their prices to be 1. This is
clearly a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium if the first-stage discounts constitute a Nash equilibrium. The problem resembles Narasimhan's model, be-
cause searching consumers essentially choose the
store with the lower price. It is easy to see that Nash
equilibrium discounts are in mixed strategies and each store's profit is 2. This is lower than the profit with no cash back site. Thus, in the absence of
switching consumers in our model, cash back sites lead to lower profits. In this case, if all loyal con-
sumers visit the cash back site, the equilibrium will reduce to Narasimhan's model although the mixed
strategies will be different from the model in which
the leakage is partial.
Now we ask how a cash back site would affect pricing if the size of the searching segment  0, and
so the market consisted only of loyal and switching
consumers. With no cash back site, this case again resembles Narasimhan's model and so equilibrium prices are in mixed strategies and each store's profit is 2. In the presence of a cash back site, the security level of profits remains 2, corresponding to a discount D1 D2 0 in the first stage. Suppose store 1 chooses D1 0. What is store 2's best response? If it also chose D2 0, the two stores would compete away the profits from switching consumers, and in equilibrium each store's profit would be the security level. But, in fact, store 2 can do better by choosing a discount D2 > 0 and compete for the switching consumers with low
discounted prices that are not available to the loyal
consumers who do not visit the cash back site. When D1 0 and D2 > 0, store 2 is more willing to lower its price, because a proportion of loyal consumers still
pay the high price. In this case, store 1 cannot do better
than the security level. The question is: how high should D2 be? Note that store 1's price in the second stage is bounded from below by +2, and so store 2 can assure itself of the entire segment at a discounted
price less than this bound. If no loyal consumers used
the cash back site, the best response would be to
choose a discount that corresponds to this lower
bound. But leakage of loyal consumers increases with
discount, so the optimal discount must take that into account. Store 2 has two strategies: D2 1 - +2, and, thus, a pure strategy with pp1 1 and pp2 1 - D2 and D2 12, and, thus, a mixed strategy with pp1 1, pp2 12, and l +2. The reason is as follows. When the equilibrium is in pure strategy, 2(0, D2) (2 (1 + D2 - D22)+ )(1 - D2), D2 > 1 - +2. It is easy to show that 2(0, D2) is decreasing in D2, and, thus, 2(0, D2) is maximized at D2 1 - +2. When the equilibrium is in mixed strategies, 2(0, D2) (2 (1 + D2 - D22) + )l. It is easy to show that 2(0, D2) is maximized at D2 12. Hence, the best response of store 2 given D1 0 would

librium results in mixed strategies, or equivalently

is easy to show that D1 0 is a best 12. If D( 0) is such that the equi-

librium results in pure strategies, or equivalently

D( 0) 1 - +2. Increasing D1 will decrease the

profits from the loyal consumers. Thus, unless store 1

can sell to more switching consumers, equivalently D1 > D2 1 - +2, the deviation is not profitable. If
D1 > 1 - +2, we can use the same arguments as

above and show that store 1 will not want to deviate

when  is not too small. In this case, there are two

(eDqu(ilibri0a),(0D)1.

, D2) corresponding to (0, D( 0)) and Note that these are asymmetric equi-

libria, and in either equilibrium the store with zero

discount has profits equal to the security level, and so

could choose to not use the cash back site. The other

store has profits that exceed the security level. Thus,

in the absence of searching consumers the cash back

site could perform a profit-increasing role but only if only one store uses the cash back site.11 Note that this

occurs because some loyal consumers do not visit the

cash back site. If all loyal consumers were to visit the

cash back site, then we get Narasimhan's model.

Do our results have any implications for the cash

back site? In our model only loyal consumers may or

may not use the cash back site. So a natural question

is: would it help for the cash back site to attract loyal

consumers by making it easier to use the site? If re-

tailers can increase profits and share it with the cash

back site, that would be beneficial. So we can now ask:

is leakage beneficial to stores? When leakage is less,

high discounts have less adverse effect on profits from

loyal consumers. In a competitive situation, this may

cause the competitor to increase discount and com-

petition shifts to discounts. On the other hand, if

leakage is higher, there is less loyalty, so second-stage

prices are lower. So stores would like some leakage to

keep the competition on discounts manageable. Thus,

the cash back site should not adopt policies to com-

pletely discourage loyal consumers. At the same time,

if leakage is too high, search prevention is not prof-

itable because the profitability of loyal consumers

decreases. Therefore, neither should the cash back site

make the site too accessible to loyal consumers.

Our next task is to find out whether the candidate

equilibrium identified in Proposition 2 can be sus-

tained as a subgame perfect equilibrium. Section 5.4

provides a road map for the lemmas that characterize

the conditions for subgame perfectness and also dis-

cusses the practical implications of the same. The proofs

Proof of Proposition 3. (Follows from Lemmas 6­9.)

The subgame perfectness property is an important

one albeit mainly technical. It is useful here to elab-

orate on the considerations that we must have in mind

in order to establish this property.

Consider the candidate symmetric equilibrium D1
D2 12. For this to be a subgame perfect equilibrium, we must rule out deviations by one store. Let us fix

store 1's choice and ask if D2 12. For example, if D2 > 12, more loyal consumers of store 2 would use the

cash back site. Given store 2's choice, suppose that

more searching say ~ . Then

A second-stage Nash equilibrium then must satisfy the necessary conditions: (i) if 0 < ~ < 1, then con-

sumers must be indifferent between choosing between the two stores;12 (ii) stores' mixed strategies

must satisfy equi-profit conditions at prices with

measure greater than zero; (iii) search cost is greater

than or equal to search benefit; and (iv) the maximum

discounted price of store i must satisfy ppi  1 - Di

Corollary 3 shows that the induced second-stage

Nash equilibrium makes the deviation unprofitable,

assuming (iv) holds with the strict inequality. This

results in symmetric mixed strategies with pp1 pp2. Lemmas 7 and 8 consider the case in which (iv) holds

with equality pp2 1 - D2, and establishes conditions that such deviations are unprofitable. The proof of Lemma 8 exploits the fact that ~ is smaller than the one

that makes 1 2, and the deviation can then be

shown to be unprofitable without explicitly solving

for the ~ that satisfies (i). Lemma 9 takes up the case in

which D2 is so large that ~ 0, and so the mixed

strategies

are

asymmetric

with

deviation unprofitable. Lemmas 6­9 thus establish

conditions that make the candidate symmetric equi-

also

subgame perfect. In other words, we analytically

established an existence result for a cash back site to

be profitable. The numerical example in Appendix C

provides an illustration of this. We can see that with the cash back site the D equilibrium can occur cor-

responding to either outcome 1 or 2 in the absence of a

cash back site.

What is the practical significance of subgame per-

fectness? Recall that in the original Stahl model,

consumers split equally across stores, equivalent to



1 2

in

our

model.

In

the

Stahl

model,

if

consumers

deviated from  12, they would end up facing higher

reservation prices. So apart from the symmetry ar-

gument, we can also see the consumers' choice as

utility maximizing. In our model too when stores

choose equal discounts, the situation is like the Stahl

model. But if D1 D2, consumers' choice of  is more complicated. Nevertheless, from a game-theoretic

viewpoint it is necessary to see whether the pro-

posed equilibrium is robust to subgame perfectness.

Note

that

the

equilibrium

requires

S< . (54+)ln(55+4+4+8)+2
4

A

natural

question

is:

if

S

>

does

a

subgame prefect equilibrium exist? The answer is in

the affirmative though it is not possible to analytically

establish the counterpart of Proposition 2 in that case.

However, the existence of a subgame perfect equi-

librium can be established by construction through a

numerical illustration, which we do next. We are also

able to gain further insights into the equilibrium

strategies from that.

Specifically, we refer to the numerical illustration in the appendix.13 We provide two examples, one that

corresponds to outcome 1 without the cash back site,

and the other to outcome 2. Let us first consider the

example of outcome 1. In this case the solution is not

subgame perfect because a profitable deviation to a higher D exists.14 What we can see is that such a

deviation is accompanied by  > 0.5. This is possible

longer necessary for  < 0.5 to hold in order to satisfy

the condition that the expected prices of the two stores

be equal. Now, if  > 0.5, obviously a profitable de-

viation exists, because the lower limit of the support

of the mixed strategy in the subgame Nash equilib-

rium increases. Indeed, it is possible that both stores'

profits can increase as a result of the deviation. That is

exactly what we find. So the question is what would

the equilibrium be in this case? When we look for a fixed

point in discounts we find that the resultant subgame

perfect equilibrium in pure strategies is asymmetric

Next, if we consider the example of outcome 2, we

Although we are unable to provide a general result

on the conditions for these types of equilibria, im-

portantly what we have been able to show, analyti-

cally and by construction, is that for all S there can be

a profitable subgame perfect equilibrium. Moreover,

cash back sites can prove profitable to retailers for

both outcomes 1 and 2 without the cash back site.

6. Implications for the Discount
In this section, we address a practical issue that could be useful to managers. Would it make more sense to offer cash back to consumers, as a percentage or a flat discount? Rather than derive the subgame perfect equilibrium with a flat fee, we proceed by examining a related problem and draw implications for the relative merit of percentage discount and flat sum. We know the equilibrium discount in our model, and, corresponding to this discount, each store has a segment of consumers that is loyal and does not use the cash back site. The combined (over the two stores) size of this segment is  (1 - D)2. Moreover, in equilibrium, the combined size of the discount availing nonsearching segment is  (2D - D2) + . Finally, the size of the searching segment is still . We then ask, given this configuration of consumers what is the "cost" of preventing search using the two methods: percentage discount and flat fee?
There are two possible ways to offer cash back to consumers. If a cash back site offers cash back as a percentage, then consumers get a percentage of the price paid. Alternatively, if the offer is a flat sum, then consumers get a fixed amount regardless of price paid. Both implementations can be observed in practice. Here, we use our model to analyze the cost of each offer, ensuring that the offer prevents search.
Proposition 4. An offer of percentage cash back can prevent search at a lower cost than an offer of a flat sum.
Proof of Proposition 4. We first examine the case in which the amount of the leakage is fixed, and then take into account the leakage also. So,  and  are fixed. Denote the flat sum offered by . In this case, the necessary conditions for a symmetric equilibrium strategy

The strategy for our proof is to compare the cost of

preventing search in the two cases. We will show that

the cost is always lower in the case of the percentage

discount assuming that the stores' profit is identical in

both cases.

Assume that the higher bounds of the equilibrium

pricing distributions are the same in both the case of the

percentage discount and the case of the flat discount.

In

other

words,

the

flat

fee must be higher than Dp to prevent search as-

suming that the higher bounds of the equilibrium

price distributions are the same in both cases. Of course,

the store can also lower the highest price to prevent

search instead of offering a higher flat discount. But in

either case, the profit will be lower than the one when

using the percentage discount. Therefore, the flat dis-

count that prevents search is more costly and less

profitable than the percentage discount. 

We have proved that to prevent search, the stores will incur a higher cost when using the flat discount if the amount of the leakage is fixed. We know that the stores have to give a larger discount or lower prices when using the flat discount to prevent search, so the amount of the leakage in this case must be larger than if the offer were a percentage discount. Taking this into consideration, the flat discount will further reduce profit.
Proposition 4 provides practical guidance on how this insight can be used. In particular, the discount offered to the consumer to prevent search is best made proportional to the price rather than a fixed amount. Note that if search can be prevented, say by a $5 discount at a higher price, then it is also prevented at all lower prices by that discount. Indeed, at a lower price a discount less than $5 should suffice. In other words, when a store charges a lower price, it can prevent search with a smaller dollar discount.17 And therefore a percentage discount results in higher profits than fixed fee when ensuring that search is prevented.
In practice, we can observe flat cash back also, although over time they have become less common. Keep in mind that the percentage discount is best if the desired effect is mainly to limit search. As we have noted, cash back sites can act as a sorting mechanism and so if the desired effect is to convey a promotional reward it may make sense to offer flat cash back especially if the dollar value is substantial. A recent casual examination of the sites: Rakuten (original Ebates), BeFrugal, Coupon Cactus, and Mr. Rebates provides some confirmation of this. The flat cash back

is offered for Dish (TV), FIOS (WiFi), Cheap-o-air (air travel), AT&T (U-verse), and Super Chewer (pet supply with a subscription option). The amounts tend to be substantial also.
Finally, it is useful to recognize that a lot of the cash back is associated with multiproduct retail stores. Thus, consumers' baskets could be split across stores if consumers decide to search for a subset of their basket. This search can be reduced or eliminated by percentage discounts. Such discounts have an effect similar to accumulating points through frequent reward programs (Lal and Bell 2003). Variation across consumers of basket size (Kumar and Rao 2006) also makes percentage discount attractive to prevent search by heterogeneous consumers.
7. Conclusions
As e-commerce continues to grow, channel arrangements also evolve to leverage possibilities that online transactions offer. One such emerging innovation is the cash back site. In this paper, we have provided an insight into how the cash back site helps the retailer to prevent search by consumers that visit the retailer. In other words, the cash back site can make the retailer site more sticky. The reason this is possible is because preventing search is a profitable strategy if the retailer can sort the loyal and the searching consumers. A cash back site serves the sorting function. The retailers' pricing strategies are such that they prevent search in equilibrium. We also find that, contrary to intuition, in the presence of cash back sites, users of the site in some situations may end up facing higher prices than they would have if there were no cash back site. Our results are based on the analysis of a multistage game involving profit maximizing retailers and cash back site.
We are also able to provide a practical guideline on how best search can be prevented. It is optimal for the retailers to offer a discount proportional to the price through the cash back site. Moreover, this discount prevents search by searching consumers at the highest possible price.
Given our interest in retailer pricing strategies, in our model we treated the site as a nonstrategic agent. In practice, the site could decide whether to allow some or all retailers to be on the site. To address this issue, one must explicitly model the sharing rule between the platform and the cash back site as a function of the number of retailers on the site. This could be a useful direction for future research.

For search to be prevented, we require that the search cost be equal to or exceed search benefit. The highest search benefit occurs at pp. So this implies S  pp - E(p) or, equivalently, pp  E(p) + S. Recall that we also require pp  1 - D. If the second constraint is not binding, we can solve for pp as follows:

If the constraint pp  1 - D is binding, then pp 1 - D. In this case, the search cost is greater than the search benefit at 1 - D.

Finally, if pp < 1 - D, for the second-stage pricing strategy

to be a Nash equilibrium, the equilibrium profits must ex-

ceed the security-level (D) that a store can obtain by devi-

ating to the maximum price 1 - D and possibly not pre-

venting search. This yields the security level of profits,

First, suppose D < D. Then (D - D)(1 - D - D) < 0, because 1 - D - D > 0. So,  < 1. Also,  > 0 if (D - D)(1 - D -

or,

equivalently,

if

Next, suppose D > D. If D is sufficiently large so that (D - D)(1 - D - D) < 0, then the previous argument implies that 0 <  < 1. Suppose (D - D)(1 - D - D) > 0. Now denote

Thus, if  < 8, there exists  that consumers can choose rendering stores symmetric in the effective loyal segment. 

Proof of Corollary 3. From Lemma 4, we know that if  < 8,

there exists a , 0 <  < 1, such that 1(D1; ) 2(D2; ) . This allows us to exploit the results of Corollary 2. From

Lemma 3 and Corollary 1, we know that if S < min(1 - D1,

However, if store 1 chooses discount D, then we will show that there exists a profitable deviation for store 2, D2 D 12. First, because  < 8, invoking Lemma 4 we know that under deviation by store 2, consumers can choose  as

In other words, the effective loyal segment under deviation, , is higher. Next, from Corollary 2,19 we know that

we

(B.13)

Collecting the results, we have, under deviation by store 2

Thus, there exists a profitable deviation if stores choose D1

Numerical

Examples:

ln(55+4+4+8)+2 4

In this section, we present a numerical example to illus-

trate the symmetric equilibrium described in Lemmas 6­9.

Suppose V 1,  0.25,  0.3 and  0.45. Then, from

Proposition 1, we know that if S < 0.185, the equilibrium is

outcome 2 with no cash back site, while if S  0.185, the

equilibrium is outcome 1 with no cash back site. From

Lemma 4, we know that if S < 0.192, then in the proposed

sreysmpmonesterictoequDil.ibIrniumPr,oDposit12i.oInn

other words, D is a best 2, we establish that if

D D profits,

back site

and

S



1 2

to lead to higher

( + ). ln(55+4+4+8)


8 5+4

The first condition is satisfied, because 0.25 < (43)0.3 0.4.

The second condition is equivalent to S  0.157. Hence, for

this example, either outcome 1 or outcome 2 can exist

when there is no cash back site in market. Specifically, if

S  [0.157, 0.185), then outcome 2 is the equilibrium without

cash back site. On the other hand, if S  [0.185, 0.1922), then

outcome 1 is the equilibrium without cash back site.

Moreover, in both cases, a cash back site leads to higher

profits for the stores.

Next, we show that for this example, all the sufficient

conditions for the subgame perfectness are satisfied. In

Lemma 5, we require that   8. This condition is auto-

matically satisfied, because Proposition 2 requires that





4 3

.

In

Lemma

8,

we

have

a

sufficient

condition

that

(5

4).

This

condition

is

satisfied,

because

0.45

>

(1.25

0.306. Finally, Lemma 9 requires that when

D2

0.871, the pure strategy's profit must be less

than 3. In this case, the store 2's profit if it deviates to such

D2 is less than 0.117. According to Corollary 2, the stores' equilibrium profit is increasing in S. Moreover, because

S  0.157, 3 > 0.125. Hence, the sufficient condition in

Lemma 9 is also satisfied. Finally, we use the same example

to illustrate the differences between the equilibrium prices

with and without a cash back site.

C.1. Prices
When S 0.19, as shown in Proposition 2, outcome 1 would
be the equilibrium without a cash back site. Again, all the conditions for a subgame perfect equilibrium are satisfied. Using Lemma 1, we get that 1 0.128 and the expected
price is equal to 0.276. If there is a cash back site in market, we use Lemma 3 to get that 3 0.151 and the expected price is equal to 0.303. We can see that the expected price in
the symmetric equilibrium is higher than the one in outcome 1. Similarly, when S 0.16, outcome 2 would be the equilibrium without a cash back site. Using Lemma 2, we get that 2 0.125 and the expected price is equal to 0.277.
If there is a cash back site in market, we use Lemma 3 to get that 3 0.135 and the expected price is equal to 0.271. We can see that the expected price in the symmetric equilibrium
is lower than the one in outcome 2.

Endnotes

1 Of course, a single consumer can be any of the three types on a purchase occasion, and the size of segments will reflect the proba-

bility of a consumer being each type.

2 Because the retailers in our model do not advertise prices, it is

reasonable to suppose that a searching consumer visits either store with probability 12. 3 It is easy to show that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium for

this problem.

4 This is also because in equilibrium there can be no mass point at p.

5 We have chosen this functional form, so we can obtain analytical

results. Other functional forms of nonusers of cash back site could be

1 2

H(D),

where

H(D) 1-D

+

1-

H(D)

is

quasiconcave

in

D.

For

example,

H(D) (1 - D)n, n > 1.

6 Thus, stores in our model cannot price any consumer out of the

market. This, in turn, implies that the undiscounted price must satisfy the constraint pi  V 1. So the discounted price of store i cannot exceed 1 - Di. This restriction helps us to capture reality in our model without having to account for some searchers searching at high prices,

but not at low prices, as that would make the analysis intractable.

7 Of course, only if Di 0, then store i could have a second-stage pricing strategy that does not prevent search as part of a Nash

equilibrium.

8 In Corollary 3 following Lemma 4 in the Appendix B, we analyze the
case D1 D2 by exploiting the idea that the searching consumers' equilibrium behavior can render 1 2 . 9 We thank a reviewer for suggesting this discussion.

10 The reason for proceeding in this fashion is that the second-stage

equilibrium for deviations is complicated to establish for all possible first-stage equilibrium pairs (D1, D2). 11 There is a symmetric mixed strategy in discounts that has both stores using the cash back site but that yields profits equal to the security level.

12 If one store offers a higher utility, then ~ 0 or 1.

14 A deviation to a lower D will cause consumers to search and so is

not profitable.

15 Obviously, there are two pure strategy equilibria in the asymmetric

case and one mixed strategy equilibrium also.

17 Indeed, the theoretically optimal strategy is a price-discount pair

over the support of prices. The percentage captures the essential

property of this pair that the two are positively correlated.
