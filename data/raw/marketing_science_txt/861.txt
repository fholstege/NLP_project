Abrand choice model with heterogeneous price-threshold parameters is used to investigate a three-regime piecewise-linear stochastic utility function. The model is used to explore the relationships between aspects of consumer price sensitivity and price thresholds using hierarchical Bayes modeling with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This study contributes to the modeling literature on discontinuous likelihoods in choice models. The empirical application using our scanner panel data set shows that the reference effect and loss aversion are more marked after price thresholds are taken into heterogeneous price response models. Furthermore, loss aversion is attenuated by using price thresholds than by an aggregate (homogeneity) model without price thresholds.

1. Introduction
Asymmetric price effects are an active area of research in marketing. Beginning with the work of Helson (1964) who first motivated the usefulness of including reference prices in sales and choice models, researchers have found asymmetric effects and the presence of price thresholds that reflect the presence of discontinuities in consumer behavior. The literature includes findings of asymmetric effect relative to the reference price (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), the disappearance of these effects in models that account for heterogeneity in price sensitivity (Chang et al. 1999, Bell and Lattin 2000), and models in which price has no effect within a price interval, i.e., a latitude of price acceptance (Gupta and Cooper 1992, Kalwani and Yim 1992, Kalyanaram and Little 1994, Han et al. 2001). However, models with threshold effects yielding intervals of price acceptance have yet to be estimated heterogeneously.
This paper introduces a heterogeneous choice model with reference prices, asymmetric responses, and price thresholds. It is characterized as a piecewise linear form so that consumers switch their utility structure accordingly as determined by the relationship between the sticker shock; i.e., the difference between retail price and reference price, and price thresholds. Heterogeneity is incorporated through a random-effects specification that allows determination of the relationship between the threshold values and consumer characteristics. MCMC algorithms

are provided for estimation. The model is illustrated using a scanner panel data set of instant-coffee purchases.
Our model contributes to the modeling literature on discontinuous likelihoods. Price thresholds generate unconventional likelihood functions and discreteness at the threshold values that make it impossible to estimate with gradient-based methods such as maximum likelihood. As discussed by Gilbride and Allenby (2004) for models with consideration sets, the Bayesian method of data augmentation is ideally suited for handling discontinuities in the likelihood surface. Here, the thresholds are associated with alternative likelihood functions that result in an apportionment of household data to alternative models. Thus, the model contributes to the marketing literature on structural heterogeneity (Yang and Allenby 2000) by allowing for abrupt changes among alternative models within the unit of analysis.
Our empirical application adds to the literature on the presence of reference prices and loss aversion that initially began with effects uncovered in scanner data, for example, as indicated by Winer (1986), Mayhew and Winer (1992), and Putler (1992), and then Chang et al. (1999) and Bell and Lattin (2000) showed that reference price effects disappear when heterogeneity is incorporated. Our empirical application shows that the reference effect and loss aversion return--at least for the data used in this study--after price thresholds are taken into a heterogeneous model. In doing so, the

degree of loss aversion is attenuated relative to results obtained using the homogeneity model without price thresholds.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our stochastic utility function and its consequent choice model--the threshold Probit model--and we develop a hierarchical Bayes modeling for it. Section 3 describes the application of scanner panel data to our model. Section 4 concludes this paper. The appendix explains details of the model estimation including the algorithm for hierarchical Bayes modeling via MCMC.

2. The Model

2.1. Threshold Probit Model and Hierarchical
Bayes Modeling
To specify the utility function, we assume that con-
sumer h's utility to brand j at time t of purchase,
Ujht, reflects a linear function of k kinds of explanatory variables. We also suppose that consumer h has a
reference price RPjht for brand j, and two price thresholds r1h and r2h r1h < 0 < r2h . Consequently, we define the three regimes--gain " g ," price acceptance " a ,"
loss " l "--utility function to brand j as

Equation (1) is capable of simultaneously reflecting

the presence of reference prices (Helson 1964), asym-

metric effects (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), and

price thresholds (Sherif et al. 1958). Asymmetries are

present when the coefficients in the different regions

take on different values. The price thresholds, rsh s = 1 2 , identify different regimes associated with the

data. The model captures a latitude of price accep-

tance (LPA hereafter) Lh = r1h r2h where prices may not affect choice if price is sufficiently small.

Notes. Model (i): aggregate (homogeneous) reference price Probit model without a threshold; Model (ii): two-regime heterogeneous reference price Probit model without a threshold (Bell and Lattin 2000); Model (iii): threeregime heterogeneous reference price Probit model with thresholds.

Figure 1 displays our utility function. In order

for the second regime of the utility function (1) to

be characterized as the LPA, and for r1h and r2h to be interpreted as price thresholds literally, i.e., for

our proposed model to be recognized as a price-

threshold model, we impose the restriction of insensi-

tiveness on the price-response parameter in the LPA

regime as

Under

the

assumption

of

consumer

homogene-

ity, Kalyanaram and Little (1994) estimated symmetric

LPA that had an insignificant price-response estimate

over this range. On the other hand, Han et al. (2001)

find a significant response parameter estimate in the

LPA. We note that their framework differs from ours

particularly in the respect that they use the same

data set throughout regimes. In contrast, our model-

ing method allocates data into three regimes.

Following the standard multinomial-brand choice

model, we assume that consumer h is observed to

make a choice at the period t between m alternatives

(cht = j . That choice is driven by the relative utility

from the last brand yjht = Ujht - Umht among latent util-

ities Unht, n = 1 2

m. We consider a panel of H

households observed over Th periods for each house-

hold. Conditional on the vector of threshold rh =

r1h r2h for consumer h, the underlying latent struc-

ture at period t when the latent utility induced by the

choice belongs to the regime i, the so-called "within

subject model for regime i" is expressed in the form

of m - 1 dimensional multiple regression,

heterogeneity is formulated by way of a hierarchical

Regarding price thresholds, we employ the model

r1h = Zhr 1 + 1h

r2h = Zhr 2 + 2h

h = 1 H (3)

where Zhr is a vector of d kinds of household specific

variables. We assume that r1h < 0 < r2h for identifi-

cation and

2.2. Discontinuous Likelihoods for Thresholds

and Their Modeling

Our model includes a threshold variable of sticker

shock Pjht -RPjht in the model, and it induces discontinuity in the likelihoods, as shown in Figure 1. Condi-

tional on the value of rh = r1h r2h , the operation generates the latent utility with three different likelihood

functions for consumer h. The independence assump-

tion of stochastic errors across regimes generates the

likelihood function of

i h

i for consumer h:

where each datum is assigned to one regime R i rh ,

and it holds that R g rh  R a rh  R l rh = Th.

In turn, conditional on

i h

i , we take the above

as a function of rh to compose the likelihood function

of price thresholds. Under the assumption of inde-

pendent choice behavior across consumers, we have

the conditional likelihood function of rh by taking products over respective consumers as

structure, we can apply the Metropolis-Hasting sam-

pling algorithm for price thresholds to obtain condi-

tional posterior rh Iht Xht

.

Prior distributions and MCMC estimation procedures

for these hierarchical Bayes models are described in

the appendix.

The proposed model is difficult to estimate with

conventional methods because the likelihood is not

differentiable in rh. Conventional maximum likelihood estimation collapses and classical asymptotic

distribution theory is not operative on this parameter,

and it must therefore rely on an adaptive approach:

conditioned on some specific value of rh, estimation is conducted through extensive use of goodness-of-fit

criterion, like AIC, in the way of a grid search to find

the estimate that minimizes the criterion.

In the price-threshold literature, Kalyanaram and

Little (1994) assume symmetric LPA by setting rh1 = rh2 = r (homogeneous), and they estimate not the threshold but the length of LPA, where several pos-

sible lengths are specified a priori, and they seek

the LPA that has an insignificant estimate of price

response inside this range. Kalwani and Yim (1992)

take a grid search approach. This approach does not

allow statistical inferences such as testing hypothe-

ses and confidence intervals. Another approach is

Bayesian inference. For example, Ferreira (1975),

Geweke and Terui (1993), and Chen and Lee (1995)

provided Bayesian approaches to deal with discontin-

uous likelihoods in econometrics and nonlinear time-

series models. Our proposed method, using more

updated tools, directly models price thresholds in

choice models in a general way and conducts coher-

ent statistical inference on them under a small-sample

situation. The advantage of our approach is that it

avoids such specification search and can accommo-

date heterogeneity.

3. Empirical Application to Scanner Panel Data

3.1. Data, Variables, and Model Specification

Data and Variables. Video Research Inc., Japan,

supplied scanner panel data for the instant-coffee cat-

egory. In all, 2,840 records for 197 panels during 1990­

1992 were available. We assume that five national

brands existed in the market during the tracking

period. We deal with five primary brands in the mar-

ket: A, B, C, D, and E. Table 1 provides descrip-

tive information about the data. Brand B has the

maximum share--over 48.03%; the minimum share--

approximately 5.74%--is for brand E. We rescale all

prices as yen/100g to equalize quantitative differ-

ences for each package of the five brands.

Variables included in the analysis are:

· Explanatory Variables: X = [Constant Price

Display Feature Brand Loyalty], where Price is the

log(price); Display and Feature are binary values; and

Brand Loyalty is a smoothing variable over past pur-

chases proposed by Guadagni and Little (1983) as

GLjht = GLjht + 1 - Ijh t-1, where a grid search (Keane 1997) is applied to fix the smoothing param-

eter as 0.75 based on the criterion of minimum

marginal likelihood.

· Household Specific Variables: Zr = [Constant

Dprone Pfreq ARP BL], where Dprone is the deal

proneness defined as the proportion of purchase (of

any five brands) made on promotion (Bucklin and

Gupta 1992, Han et al. 2001); Pfreq is the shop-

ping frequency (three categories; H3 of Kalyanaram and Little 1994: shopping frequency is a factor to

affect the price thresholds); ARP represents the mea-

sure of average reference-price level as defined by

We further define

hold members) and Expend is nine categories (shop-

ping expenditure/month) used in Rossi et al. (1996).

Specification of Reference Price. The literature presents some conceptualizations for the reference price RPjht. Following Briesch et al. (1997), we employ a brand-specific reference price. We also consider four kinds of reference prices of two categories: memorybased and stimulus-based. That is,
(1) Memory-based as (A) RPjht = Pjh t-1, the price at its last purchase and (B) RPjht = RPjh t-1 + 1 - · Pjh t-1, the smoothed price over previous purchases;
(2) Stimulus-based as (C) RPjht = Pkht, where k means the brand at the last purchase, and (D) RPjht = Prht, where r indicates the price of a brand chosen randomly at the time of purchase.
Model Specification. We consider three models for comparison with other candidates: (i) aggregate (homogeneous) reference-price Probit model without a threshold (Winer 1986, Mayhew and Winer 1992, Putler 1992); (ii) two regimes' heterogeneous reference price Probit model without a threshold (Chang et al. 1999, Bell and Lattin 2000); and our proposed (iii) three-regime heterogeneous reference-price Probit model with thresholds. With four types of reference prices for each model above, summing to 12 models are considered for comparison.
Table 2 describes logs of marginal likelihood for model comparison. The model (C)(iii): stimulus-based RP(C) three regime heterogeneous Probit with thresholds is most supported by marginal likelihood criterion. Consequently, some evidence supports the hypothesis of price-threshold existence that was discussed by Kalyanaram and Little (1994) even by using the models incorporating heterogeneous consumers. The summary statistics of parameter estimates for that model are provided in Table 3. To save space, estimates of constant terms are not listed here.
Our chosen stimulus-based RP is compatible with previous studies of Hardie et al. (1993), stating that it seems likely that characteristics of the brand last purchased will be more available in memory in particular with consumer package goods, and moreover Rajendran and Tellis (1994) discuss the reasons of appropriateness for stimulus-based RP in detail.

3.2. Reference Effects, Loss Aversion, and Price Thresholds
Our analysis indicates the presence of asymmetric reference effects, loss aversion, and heterogeneity. This finding is different from Chang et al. (1999) and Bell and Lattin (2000) where asymmetric effects were negligible when heterogeneity and price thresholds were incorporated into the model.
Corresponding to each type of RP, (A)­(D), we have four sets of models: (A)(i), (A)(ii), (A)(iii) through (D)(i), (D)(ii), (D)(iii). Based on the most supported RP of (C), price-response estimates at the aggregated level show some loss aversion because, in the case of (C)(iii), we have the estimate of regime (g)--gain-- which is smaller than that of regime (l)--loss--as (gain: -3 142, loss: -4 518). The same applies to the model (i) (gain: -4 251, loss: -7 021) and (ii) (gain: -1 637, loss: -2 622). We further observe the following: (i) aggregate (homogeneous) Probit without a threshold shows loss aversion most clearly at the aggregated level; (ii) two-regime heterogeneous Probit without a threshold is the most vague; and (iii) our proposed three-regime heterogeneous Probit with thresholds yields performance between (i) and (ii).
We found the presence of asymmetric reference effects and loss aversion after price thresholds were incorporated into the model for this data set. This

observation is robust relative to other types of refer-

ence price, except for (A)(ii), (B)(ii), and (B)(iii).

Following Bell and Lattin (2000, p. 190, Figure 1),

we present intuitive reasoning for our results. First,

Bell and Lattin (2000) discuss the relation between

models (i) and (ii) relative to loss aversion: model (i)

has steeper slopes in the loss regime (

l A

>

l BL

as

well as the gain regime (

g A

>

g BL

than model (ii),

however, the difference (

l A

-

l BL

is larger in the

loss regime than (

g A

-

g BL

is in the gain regime.

Therefore, loss aversion would decrease or disappear

if heterogeneity were incorporated into the model.

Next, we examine the relation between models (ii)

and (iii). The response functions assumed in each

model are shown in Figure 1; we note that the

response function of model (ii), corresponding to the

model of Bell and Lattin (2000), has two regimes

without price thresholds. Two response functions are

kinked at the zero of sticker shock. Our model (iii),

however, has three regimes. We suppose that the true

response function has LPA (insensitive range) limited

by the price thresholds, as shown in Figure 1, and that

the data are observed along with three lines.

If we fit only two response functions, as employed

in Bell and Lattin (2000), to data over positive and

negative sides of sticker-shock domain separately,

the

fitted

slopes

(

g BL

l BL

will be less steep than

the slopes g l of the three-regime model in the

gain-and-loss regimes. That is,

g BL

<

g,

l BL

<

l because the fitted slopes are calculated so as to

catch up with the data inside LPA, to which a flatter

line is applied by definition. For that reason, a model

with price thresholds is likely to be more responsive

than a model without a threshold for both loss and

gain regimes. Table 3 presents empirical evidence to

support this conjecture, which is robust with respect

to the choice of reference price.

On the other hand, that discussion indicates no ten-

dency for loss aversion between models with and

without thresholds. However, relying on Kahneman

and Tversky (1979), it would be likely for g - l

(we define it as the degree of loss aversion) to be pos-

itive in most cases because we are trying to model

individual consumers' responses. In fact, we used our

data to calculate the posterior probability Pr Gain -

Loss data at the aggregated level for models (i),

(ii), and (iii). Figure 2 displays the posterior density of

the difference Gain - Loss . The distributions agree

with Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979),

and the degree of loss aversion is strongest for model

(i) in the sense that the posterior probability of loss

aversion Pr Gain - Loss > 0 data is largest; it is

weakest for model (ii). Model (iii) is located between

them. The relation between (i) and (ii) is consistent

with the results of Bell and Lattin (2000). The relation

between (ii) and (iii) implies that the degree of loss

The relationship between household-specific variables and their market-response parameters was significantly estimated. However, they are not reported here to save space.

3.3. Price Thresholds and Their Hierarchical

Structure

Figure 3 shows the frequency distribution of Bayes

estimates r^1h h = 1

H and r^2h h = 1

H,

where r^·h is the mean of posterior distribution of

threshold parameters for household h. Both distribu-

tions exhibit skewness showing distinct features of

each other. The average distances from zero are dif-

ferent: -0 113 for the lower threshold r^1h and 0.138 for the upper threshold r^2h. For that reason, the symmetric LPA around zero could fail to reflect heterogeneity

in the brand choice study.

Table 4 shows that all hierarchical Bayes esti-

mates of regression coefficients 1 and 2 of (3) on household-specific variables are significant in the

sense that the 95% HPD region does not include zero.

From these estimates, we first note that LPAs rel-

ative to households are not symmetric around the

zero levels of their respective sticker shocks. We also

observe the following: (1) For Pfreq versus LPA, the mean level of LPA increases with the purchase frequency, which is consistent with previous empirical findings; e.g., on the hypothesis H3 of Kalyanaram and Little (1994): "Pfreq is a factor to affect price thresholds." (2) For Dprone versus LPA, the mean level of LPAs decreases accordingly as the increase in deal proneness, which is compatible with Han et al. (2001). (3) For ARP versus LPA, the estimates show that the household with high ARP value has wider LPA, which is consistent with the result to the hypothesis H2 of Kalyanaram and Little (1994): "ARP is a factor to affect price thresholds."

4. Concluding Remarks
This study introduced a three-regime piecewise-linear stochastic utility function with two price thresholds, and proposed a class of brand-choice model-- threshold Probit model--under a framework of a continuous mixture modeling for heterogeneous consumers. Price thresholds generate unconventional discontinuous likelihood functions in the analysis, and they create difficulties in estimation. However, our method directly models thresholds for choice models in a general manner, and coherent statistical inference on the thresholds can be done particularly when the number of samples is scarce.
Our empirical application, as far as our data set is concerned, shows that our proposed model is superior to a conventional linear-utility-based Probit model without price thresholds as well as aggregate Probit models; the reference effect and loss aversion are observed after price thresholds are incorporated into a heterogeneous price-response model, but that loss aversion is attenuated then by an aggregate (homogeneous) model without price thresholds. Moreover, through hierarchical modeling, we investigated explanatory factors of heterogeneous price thresholds. Some are consistent with previous studies that assumed consumer homogeneity.
Individual heterogeneity makes it possible to design a customized strategy, which has been demanded recently as we can see, for example, in Gal-Or and Gal-Or (2005) for customized advertising. As an application of our model, we explored a possibility of customized pricing strategy based on the knowledge of price thresholds for respective households. Our limited simulation study showed that customized pricing could yield greater profits than flat pricing, and optimal pricing levels are provided at the lower price thresholds for discounting, and at the upper price thresholds for a price hike. However, this is not reported here to save space.
Our analysis can be generalized further in several aspects. For example, heterogeneous modeling could be applied to smoothing parameters of the reference price derived from exponentially weighted past prices. Moreover, it can be extended to accommodate the dynamic relation on a utility function, for example, such as Leichty et al. (2005) recently proposed. Together with a comprehensive discussion of customized pricing mentioned above, we leave these problems for future research.

Monte Carlo Algorithm for Hierarchical Bayes

Modeling of Threshold Probit Model

As for model calibration, extending the framework of Rossi

et al. (1996), we employ hierarchical Bayes modeling to

implement the threshold Probit model (6). Given the value of

rh, according to the level of consumer h's sticker shock Pjht -

RPjht, we first allocate data Xht of the explanatory variable

to make Xjhit i = responding latent

occasion. The cora l is generated

based on personal choice data Iht (the index of observed

choices) using the algorithm of the Bayesian Probit model

(Rossi et al. 1996, pp. 338­339) applied to each regime. Then,

except for price threshold rh -, we can use conditional pos-

terior distributions: yhit Iht Xht

As for hierarchical modeling for the price threshold,

the lower (negative) threshold is modeled as r1h = zh 1 +

In terms of sampling algorithms (A-1) and (A-2) for Markov chain Monte Carlo, we can constitute the posterior distribution of each regime, respectively, to get overall joint posterior density across regimes.
