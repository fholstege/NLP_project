Abstract. Television viewers are increasingly engaging in media-multitasking while watching programming. One prevalent multiscreen activity is the simultaneous consumption of television alongside social media chatter about the programming, an activity referred to as "social TV." Although online interactions with programming can result in a more engaged and committed audience, social TV activities may distract media multitaskers from advertisements. These competing outcomes of social TV raise the question: are programs with high online social TV activity, so called "social shows," good for advertisers? In this research, we empirically examine this question by exploring the relationship among television advertising, social TV, online traffic, and online sales. Specifically, we investigate how the volume of program-related online chatter is related to online shopping behavior at retailers that advertise during the programs. We find that advertisements that air in programs with more social TV activity see increased ad responsiveness in terms of subsequent online shopping behavior. This result varies with the mood of the advertisement, with more affective advertisements--in particular, funny and emotional advertisements--seeing the largest increases in online shopping activity. Our results shed light on how advertisers can encourage online shopping activity on their websites in the age of multiscreen consumers.

1. Introduction
Multi-screen activity by television viewers is on the rise, with an estimated 80% of U.S. television viewers simultaneously using another device while watching television (Nielsen 2014, IAB 2015). One of the most prevalent multiscreen activities is "social TV," which is the joint viewing of television programming alongside the consumption and/or production of program-related social media chatter (Benton and Hill 2012, Fossen and Schweidel 2017). Nearly 40% of multiscreeners in the United States engage in social TV activity (IAB 2015).
The rapid growth of social TV has raised questions for advertisers. On the one hand, social TV may benefit advertisers. Participation in online chatter may engage viewers, making them more tuned-in to the show, which in turn may improve the effectiveness of subsequent ads (Nielsen 2015a, Flomenbaum 2016). Research on media context effects has shown that increased show involvement can improve attitudes and purchase

intent of advertised brands (e.g., Norris and Colman 1993, Feltham and Arnold 1994, Kilger and Romer 2007) and reduce ad avoidance (Teixeira et al. 2010). The positive effects of program involvement on ad response are thought to result from a halo effect, with the increased interest in the show carrying over to the processing of the ads (e.g., Feltham and Arnold 1994, Wang and Calder 2009, Schweidel et al. 2014).
On the other hand, social TV may distract viewers from watching and processing ads. As a result, "social shows," those programs with high levels of social TV activity, may be less attractive to advertisers. Indeed, research has found that high levels of show involvement can hurt ad recall (Norris and Colman 1993, Tavassoli et al. 1995). Fossen and Schweidel (2017) also find evidence to suggest that viewers who discuss shows online may be doing so at the expense of engaging with advertised brands online. Recent studies have also found that online activities and television viewing may be substitute activities (Hinz et al. 2016, Seiler et al. 2017).

In this research, we empirically examine these contrasting theories on the link between online program engagement--as inferred from social TV activity-- and ad effectiveness by presenting the first examination of the relationship among television advertising, social TV, online traffic, and online sales. We explore two research questions. First, are social shows beneficial for advertisers? To explore this, we examine how online program engagement relates to changes in online traffic and purchases for retailers following television ads. We consider two measures of social TV and allow their relationship with ad response to vary across ad characteristics. Examining this question allows us to extend (1) research on cross-media effects that has yet to consider the joint relationship among television advertising, online word-of-mouth (WOM), and online shopping; and (2) work on media context effects that has not explored media multitasking. Second, how can television advertising increase online shopping? We investigate how retailers can use ad design and media buying strategies to encourage online traffic and sales following television ads. We extend research on the relationship between television advertising and online shopping (Liaukonyte et al. 2015) by accounting for social TV behavior. Overall, our investigation of these research questions allows us to (1) examine how social TV activity relates to changes in viewers' responses to television ads in terms of traffic to and purchases on advertisers' websites, and (2) shed light on how advertisers can use ad design and media buying strategies to encourage online shopping activity in the age of multiscreen consumers.
We build a multisource data set that includes online traffic and sales on retailers' websites, primetime television advertising for the retailers, social media chatter mentioning the programs in which the ads air or the retailers, and ad and program characteristics. Our data include more than 1,600 ad instances for five retailers that advertise on 83 programs during the fall 2013 television season. We jointly model the traffic and sales on a retailer's website following an ad's airing as a function of social TV activity and ad and program characteristics using a hierarchical Bayesian regression. We assess the relationship between social TV activity about the program and online shopping by considering two measures of online program engagement: the volume of program chatter and change in program chatter immediately before an ad's airing.
We find a significant relationship between online program chatter and online shopping following advertisements, with these effects varying with the mood of the ad. Emotional ads spur the largest increases in web traffic when they air in shows with higher volumes of program chatter. Across both measures of online program engagement, we find that ads spur more online purchases when they air in more social

shows, with funny ads spurring the largest increases in sales when they air in more social shows and with active and informational ads generating the smallest increases in sales. More affective ads--in particular, those with an emotional or funny mood--may be more successful in social shows because such ads effectively recapture viewers' attention from the program and allow for the engaged processing of the program to spill over to ad processing (e.g., Sternthal and Craig 1973, Zillmann et al. 1980, Olney et al. 1991, Eisend 2009). Overall, our results suggest that social shows benefit advertisers, with advertisers airing affective ads seeing the largest increases in subsequent online shopping activity.
The remainder of this research is organized as follows. We next review work on program engagement and media context effects to explore what influence social shows may have on ad effectiveness. We then discuss the data and the modeling approach. We present our results and conclude with a discussion of implications of our research for retailers and television networks, as well as opportunities for future research on media context effects and cross-media effects.
2. Television Program Engagement and Media Context Effects on Advertisements
Are social shows good for advertisers? Research has not yet explored the relationship between online program engagement and sales of advertised brands. However, past work has established that television content can impact online behaviors (e.g., Lewis and Reiley 2013, Joo et al. 2014, Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017) and has explored the impact of other measures of show involvement on ad effectiveness. This research also has argued that online chatter reflects broader trends in viewer engagement (Godes and Mayzlin 2004). Industry studies also have begun to explore how social TV activity correlates with viewers' attention and ad response (e.g., Nielsen 2015a, b). We use the insights from these works to discuss why social shows may be either good or bad for advertisers. Although our intent is not to test a particular behavioral theory, we use the following discussion to motivate our empirical analysis.
2.1. Why Social Shows May Be Good for Advertisers Research on media context and cross-media effects suggests four key reasons why programs with high online engagement may benefit advertisers. First, participation in online chatter about a program may indicate that viewers are engaged with the program, which enhances opportunities to process ads. Nielsen (2015a) finds a positive correlation between Twitter posts (tweets) about programs and neurological measures of engagement (attention, memory, and emotional

276

Fossen and Schweidel: Social TV, Advertising, and Sales Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 274­295, © 2019 INFORMS

arousal) for the program's general audiences. Thus, increases in online engagement may correlate with increases in neurological engagement that improve viewers' opportunities to process ads. Research on media context effects supports these findings, arguing that heightened program involvement can increase viewers' cognitive arousal and attention, which enhances viewers' opportunities to process ads (e.g., Celsi and Olson 1988, MacInnis et al. 1991, Lord and Burnkrant 1993, Dahlén 2005). Studies also show that increases in viewer attention, processing effort, and/ or involvement with programs relate to better ad recall (Singh and Hitchon 1989), improved ad attitudes (Murry et al. 1992, Feltham and Arnold 1994), reduced ad skipping (Woltman Elpers et al. 2003, Teixeira et al. 2010), and increased purchase intent (Norris and Colman 1993, Feltham and Arnold 1994, Kilger and Romer 2007). The effects of increased program involvement on ad effectiveness are argued to be driven by a halo effect, with increased program interest carrying over to ad processing (e.g., Dahlén 2005, Wang and Calder 2009, Schweidel et al. 2014).
Second, online program engagement may encourage a committed viewing audience. Shows with high online chatter have more viewers who watch multiple episodes, watch live, and watch without changing the channel during ads (Russell 2012, Nielsen 2015b), all of which are important to advertisers (Lynch 2015). Third, social shows may benefit advertisers because media multitasking during television viewing can decrease the ability to counterargue or resist persuasion attempts, thereby increasing ad effectiveness (e.g., Jeong and Hwang 2012, Kazakova et al. 2016). Last, social TV may be good for advertisers because it can increase production and consumption of brandrelated earned media. Viewers who converse about programs may also discuss ads online, an activity that increases earned media for the advertised brand and provides advertisers with a real-time gauge of ad effectiveness (Fossen and Schweidel 2017). Viewers engaged on social media during shows also may be exposed to and more attentive to consumption-oriented earned media, which can prime a shopping mindset (Zhang et al. 2017).
2.2. Why Social Shows May Be Bad for Advertisers Whereas several studies present evidence that online program engagement is good for advertisers, other work suggests that it may be detrimental to ad effectiveness. The same factors that enhance a viewer's opportunity to process ads--like an engaging program--may reduce her motivation or ability to process ads (MacInnis et al. 1991). Indeed, higher levels of program engagement can distract viewers from ad information by lowering attentional or motivational capacity to process ads (e.g., Sternthal and Craig 1973,

Lord and Burnkrant 1993, Feltham and Arnold 1994, Tavassoli et al. 1995, Teixeira et al. 2014, Hinz et al. 2016, Kazakova et al. 2016). Increased program engagement also can enhance perceptions that ads are intrusions (Schweidel and Moe 2016). The negative effects of high program involvement can damage ad recall (Pavelchak et al. 1988, Norris and Colman 1993, Tavassoli et al. 1995), ad attitudes (Tavassoli et al. 1995), and ad persuasiveness (Teixeira et al. 2014). However, Tavassoli et al. (1995), Pavelchak et al. (1988), and Teixeira et al. (2014) only find these effects at very high levels of show involvement.
Consistent with the idea that social shows may be bad for advertisers, recent work has found that television viewing and online activity may be substitute behaviors. Fossen and Schweidel (2017) find evidence that viewer online engagement with programs may occur at the expense of online engagement with advertised brands. Hinz et al. (2016) suggest that major television events can reduce online activity on bidding websites. Finally, Seiler et al. (2017) find that the inability of viewers to engage in social TV activity during programs does not impact viewing, suggesting that these may not be complementary activities.
2.3. The Role of Mood of the Advertisement Because increased program involvement may enhance the opportunity to process ads while simultaneously reducing the motivation or ability to process ads, we anticipate that television ads that successfully increase viewer attention or motivation to process ads will be more effective in social shows. Research has shown that specific ad characteristics can increase viewer attention and motivation to process ad information. Notably, among these are humor appeals (e.g., Sternthal and Craig 1973, Zillmann et al. 1980, MacInnis et al. 1991, Eisend 2009). In contrast, informational ads can have the opposite effect (Woltman Elpers et al. 2003). Research has also found that entertaining and affective ads, compared with informational and rational ads, gain more attention from viewers and reduce ad skipping (Olney et al. 1991, Woltman Elpers et al. 2003, Yoo and MacInnis 2005). When motivation to process an ad is low, a situation that may occur at high levels of program involvement, informational and rational ads may be even less effective, whereas ads with a positive mood may be more effective (MacInnis et al. 2002). Rational ads may be less effective when program entertainment is high because these ads deviate from the hedonic viewing experience, reducing viewers' motivation and ability to process ad information (Woltman Elpers et al. 2003). Overall, these works suggest that the benefit of social shows for advertisers may depend on the mood of the advertisement, with affective ads expecting improved ad effectiveness relative to

277

rational ads when online engagement with the program is high.
2.4. Social TV and Online Shopping Prior work has not examined what impact program involvement will have on ad response when (1) program engagement occurs online, which involves some viewers' media multitasking, and (2) ad response is studied in terms of actual sales rather than other ad effectiveness measures, such as recall and purchase intent. The two closest works to this study, Liaukonyte et al. (2015) and Fossen and Schweidel (2017), do not address these questions. We extend the study by Liaukonyte et al. (2015) of television advertising's impact on online shopping by considering how online program engagement may effect this relationship. We build on the analysis of social TV by Fossen and Schweidel (2017) by examining how program chatter impacts ad response beyond changes in online brand WOM by considering its relationship with online sales.
We treat the investigation of the relationship between social TV and online shopping and the assessment of whether social shows are good for advertisers as empirical questions. We consider two measures of online program engagement: (1) the volume of program chatter in an episode leading up to an ad's airing and (2) the change in program chatter in the minute before an ad's airing. Following prior research, we allow the effects of online program engagement to be nonlinear (e.g., Tavassoli et al. 1995). We consider these two measures because both the volume and the temporal variation in online WOM have been linked to sales (Xiong and Bharadwaj 2014, Gelper et al. 2018). A sudden spike in program-related online chatter also indicates an increase in media multitasking, an activity that can create attention-diminishing task interference (Brasel and Gips 2011, Kazakova et al. 2016). As such, we may see different effects of online program engagement on ad response when considering the volume of program mentions versus the change in program mentions in the minute before the ad airs. Following previous work that suggests that program involvement may moderate the impact of ad mood on ad response, we also explore interactions between the two measures of online program engagement and ad mood.
3. Data Description
3.1. Online Shopping Data We collected data on online shopping behavior from comScore, Inc.'s Web Behavior Database.1 These data contain browsing activity for a panel of 100,000 active U.S. internet users and include machine- and minutelevel data on traffic to and purchases on a given website. This panel is a random sample of U.S. users from more than two million global panelists who have

given comScore explicit permission to track their online browsing and buying. Our data include online traffic and purchases from this panel at the websites of five large, national retailers.2 Each of these retailers--or the retailer's parent company in one case--appeared on the 2013 Fortune 500 list and netted at least $10 billion in sales in the 2013 fiscal year. We track new sessions and purchases on the retailers' websites and on the websites mentioned in the retailers' advertisements during the fall 2013 television season (September­December 2013).3
3.2. Advertising Data Advertising data are collected for the retailers from Kantar Media's Stradegy database. These data include national, primetime, broadcast (ABC, CBS, CW, FOX, and NBC) advertisements on the initial airing of recurring programs4 from the fall 2013 television season. The retailers advertise a range of products, including apparel accessories, computers and accessories, fragrances, make-up and skin care products, smartphones and accessories, software, and tablets and accessories.5 Our data include 1,685 ad instances for the five retailers that aired on 83 television programs. To control for online advertising spending, we also collect data on internet display spend, internet search spend, and online video spend by the retailers from Stradegy.6
3.3. Social Media Data We supplement these data with minute-level Twitter mentions about the television programs in which the ads air and about the retailers. Program-related Twitter mentions were collected via Topsy Pro, and retailer-related Twitter mentions were collected via Crimson Hexagon. At the time of collection, both Topsy Pro and Crimson Hexagon were certified Twitter partners with access to the public firehose of Twitter posts.7 We focus on Twitter mentions because the majority of public social media chatter about television occurs on Twitter (Schreiner 2013). Twitter mentions for programs and retailers were gathered by tallying tweets that contain the program/retailer's name, a hashtag(s) with a program/retailer's name, or the Twitter handle of the program/retailer. For program mentions, we expand this search criteria to include nicknames (e.g., DWTS for Dancing with the Stars) to capture as much chatter as possible about the programs. We use the program mentions to measure online program engagement and retailer mentions to control for its impact. For the latter, although past studies have found evidence of a positive relationship between online brand WOM and sales (e.g., You et al. 2015, Babic´ Rosario et al. 2016), engaging in online WOM about ads may distract viewers from conversing online about the show or from online shopping. Thus, we account for retailer chatter in our analysis.

3.4. Advertisement and Program Characteristics
We supplement our data with ad and program characteristics to control for their impacts on online shopping and to provide insights into our second research question--how can television advertising increase online shopping activity? We account for ad position because past work on television advertising has found that ad response varies with ad position (e.g., Danaher and Green 1997, Schweidel et al. 2014). Specifically, we control for when the ad airs (time, day, and month), position of the ad in the commercial break and in the program, whether the ad airs near a half-hour interval or not, and whether the ad runs concurrently with another ad break on a different broadcast network or not. The data on ad position were extracted from Stradegy.
We also account for measures of ad content that can influence ad effectiveness (e.g., Stewart and Furse 1986, Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017), including ad length, website calls-to-action, and references to a price. Ad length is provided by Stradegy. Each ad in the data was viewed by two coders to identify whether the ad contains a web address and refers to price.8 Given that ad effectiveness in social shows may vary with ad mood, as discussed previously, we use ispot.tv, a television ad analytics firm, to identify the mood of the advertisements. They label ads as active, emotional, funny, informational, or sexy using a layered process of "automation, inhouse editorial and crowd sourcing on our public website." The mood categories are mutually exclusive, with each ad assigned to one category. iSpot.tv allows "active" to describe ads that do not fall into one of the four other mood categories.
We include program-specific effects to control for the impact of the program and its characteristics on ad response. We also control for whether an ad airs during a season premiere or fall finale episode because viewers' responses to ads may vary during such episodes (Fossen and Schweidel 2017). Last, to control for the number of viewers exposed to ad i, we collect data on audience size from comScore, Inc.'s TV Essentials database, which includes viewing data collected from more than 20 million U.S. households. We use the U.S. audience size estimate for the 30-second interval (the granularity provided by TV Essentials) in which ad i begins airing.
3.5. Descriptive Statistics Tables 1­4 show descriptive statistics for the online shopping, advertising, and social media data across the retailers. The retailers vary in advertising between 1 and 19 products and airing between 4 and 771 ad instances during the fall 2013 television season (Table 1). Four out of the five retailers vary the mood of their ads across this time period. The majority of ad instances in the data have an active mood (72%), followed by an informational mood (14%), funny mood (11%), sexy

mood (2%), and emotional mood (1%). The retailers on average utilize just under three ad mood types in their broadcast ad campaigns during the fall 2013 season. Each ad mood is used by at least two retailers and is featured in at least 11 ad instances and three ad creatives. Additionally, each of the ad mood types is used across the two retailers where the majority of purchases occurs. We leverage this variation within retailers in terms of ad mood strategies and unique ad creatives and ad instances aired to explore the relationship between social TV activity and ad response in terms of viewers' post-ad online shopping behavior.9
Tables 2 and 3 show how online chatter about the retailers and programs changes around the ads. Retailer chatter increases by an average of 8% in the five-minute window after the ad, compared with the five-minute window before the ad, but these increases vary across retailers and have large standard deviations. Figure 110 provides further evidence that retailer chatter seems to increase after the ad for most retailers, but this effect subsides quickly, consistent with work on advertising and WOM (Fossen and Schweidel 2017). In Table 3, we see variation in the volume of program mentions around the ads. The ads air in programs that average 281 program mentions per minute up until the ads' airings, and program chatter in the minute before an ad airs is higher than its per-minute average in the episode leading up to the ad's airing. Both of these metrics of online program engagement have large standard deviations. Table A.4 in the online appendix presents descriptive statistics for online program chatter across the 83 programs in the data and illustrates the substantial variation in program WOM leading up to the ads and in the minute before ads air, both across the episodes of a given program and across programs. This suggests that the variation in program chatter is not solely determined by fixed program or audience characteristics (e.g., program features, genre, network, time aired, viewer demographics).11
Per our data agreement, we cannot present volume of web traffic or sales at the retailer level, because this could provide identifying information about the retailers. We can illustrate the volume of the online shopping activity summed across retailers and present non-volume descriptive statistics at the retailer level. In total, 28,763 unique comScore panelists generated 438,663 web sessions to the retailers' websites from September 1 to December 31, 2013. Of these web sessions, 6,462 occur within five minutes of an advertisement. Additionally, 9,836 unique panelists generated 23,003 transactions, for a total of 25,040 products purchased at the retailers' websites from September 1 to December 31, 2013.12 The average total basket price per transaction is $90. Of these transactions, 377 are generated by web sessions initiated within five minutes of an ad.13 In Figure 2, we illustrate

the volume of web sessions and transactions at the retailers' websites summed across the five retailers, as well as the volume of national, primetime, broadcast ads aired by the retailers across the fall 2013 television season. Not surprisingly, the volumes of web sessions and transactions have similar patterns, peaking in the holiday shopping season.
Table 4 and Figures 1, 3, and 4 show traffic and sales on the retailers' websites around the ads. The vast majority of ad instances in our data see web traffic activity in the five-minute window after the ad (Table 4). The retailers see an average increase in traffic of 20% in the five-minute after the ad window compared with the five-minute pre-ad window, but the standard deviations are large. From Figure 1 we see that whereas some retailers see increases in traffic after the ad, the impact for other retailers is less clear. This seems consistent with Liaukonyte et al. (2015), who find that three out of seven retailers do not have significant product effects on web traffic after the ad, whereas three (one) have mainly positive (negative) impacts on traffic after the ad. Figure 4 presents the relationship between changes in web traffic around ads and social TV, and it shows, across all ad instances, (1) a positive relationship between the change in traffic

and the volume of program chatter leading up to an ad, and (2) a positive relationship between the change in traffic and the change in program chatter in the minute before an ad's airing. We also see that the changes in web traffic may vary across levels of the social TV measures and across ad mood. Figure 4 may also suggest possible nonlinear relationships between online program engagement and web traffic.
For online sales, the average conversion rate across retailers is 6% (Table 4), which is similar to the 7% conversion rate for retailers found by Liaukonyte et al. (2015) in their work on online shopping.14 In Figure 3, we see evidence that more sales are generated in the short-term period after the ad than in the corresponding period before the ad. Similarly, Table 4 reveals that retailers see an increase in sales when comparing purchases after the ad to purchases before the ad, but these estimates have large standard deviations. Figure 4 presents the relationship between social TV and changes in purchases around ads. Across all ad instances, Figure 4 shows a slight negative linear relationship between the change in purchases and the volume of program chatter leading up to an ad but may illustrate a nonlinear relationship whereby purchases increase as program chatter increases, with

Notes. Percentage changes are calculated as (activity in post-ad window - activity in pre-ad window)/(activity in post-ad window + 1). For the change in purchases after the ad, we use the number of web sessions within five minutes of an ad's airing that generate transactions in the next 24 hours. 39% (8%) of ad instances see a positive change in web traffic (online purchases), whereas 42% (2%) of ad instances see a negative change in web traffic (online purchases). Conversion rate is calculated as (number of web sessions initiated within 5 minutes of an ad's airing that generated a transaction in the next 24 hours)/(number of web sessions initiated within five minutes of an ad's airing). If we exclude the purchase consideration window and look at the percentage change in purchases from five minutes before the ad to five minutes after the ad, we see that the
mean (SD) percentage change in purchases is 3.71% (36.41%). SD, standard deviation.

diminishing returns at higher levels of chatter. Figure 4 also shows a slight positive relationship between the change in purchases and the change in program chatter in the minute before an ad's airing. As with traffic, we also see evidence in Figure 4 that the changes in online purchases may vary across levels of online program engagement and across ad mood, as well as evidence of possible nonlinear relationships between online program engagement and online purchases.
Overall, Figure 4 suggests that online program engagement may have a meaningful relationship with ad response in terms of subsequent online shopping. However, these descriptive statistics do not model nonlinear impacts of program engagement or control for other factors that may impact ad response. Thus,

a formal model is needed to explore the relationship between online program engagement and online shopping, which we describe in the next section.
As shown in Table 4, most purchase activity is generated at two of the five retailers. Although most ad instances have web traffic activity in the five-minute window after the ad, few ad instances generate transactions from the web traffic in the five-minute window after the ad. To overcome this limitation and ensure that there is sufficient variation to estimate how social TV relates to web traffic and sales, we estimate our model on 60 variants of the data (main model and 59 alternative analyses). These analyses include considering traffic and purchases from 1 to 60 minutes after the ad, varying the purchase consideration window,

Notes. Solid (dashed) line shows online retailer mentions (web traffic to the retailer's website). The y-axis is volume of online retailer mentions around the ads' airings summed across all ad instances for the retailer. Because of the data agreement with comScore, we cannot show volume for web sessions at the retailer level, so this axis is excluded from Figure 1. Increases before the ads' airings are the result of the discrete time interpolation.

considering only ad creatives with sales activity (ad creatives that have at least one web session initiated within five minutes of the ad that generates a purchase in the next 24 hours), considering only ad instances with sales activity (ad instances with at least one web session initiated within five minutes of the ad that

generate a purchase in the next 24 hours), varying the operationalization of the outcome measures, and varying the ad mood categories. All 60 analyses present, at a minimum, directionally consistent results and are discussed in the following sections and detailed in the online appendix.

To assess the relationship among television adver-
tising, social TV, and online shopping, we model both online traffic and purchases15 following the airing of

where µses and µpur are intercepts. r. are retailerspecific effects for the five retailers,16 and p. are program-specific effects for the 83 programs. These
effects account for unobservable differences across
retailers and programs that may impact our outcomes
(e.g., program attractiveness to advertisers or demographics).17 In our main analysis, LogSessionsPostAdi (LogSessionsPreAdi) is the log of the number of web sessions initiated at the website for the retailer in ad i from when ad i airs until five minutes after ad i airs (from five minutes before ad i until ad i). LogPurch-
asesPreAdi is the log of the number of purchases on the retailer's website from five minutes before ad i airs
until ad i airs. LogPurchasesPostAdi is the log of the number of purchases generated by sessions initiated on the retailer's website from when ad i airs until five
minutes after ad i. We consider the volume of pur-
chases that occur within 24 hours by these sessions that were initiated in the five-minute period after the ad. Thus, if a user initiated a session in the five-minute
window after ad i on the website of the retailer in ad i,
we track her purchasing behavior over the next 24
hours to determine whether she made a purchase on the retailer's website. The one-day purchase consid-
eration window for LogPurchasesPostAdi acknowledges that purchase decisions take time to occur once a website visit is initiated (Liaukonyte et al. 2015).18
Last, Xi.is a vector of ad and program characteristics, which are summarized in Table 5. We assess the
relationship between social TV activity about the pro-
gram and online shopping by considering both the
volume of online program mentions up until ad i airs
(LogPWOMVolumei) and the change in program mentions in the minute before ad i airs (PWOMChangei), as defined in Table 5. We include quadratic terms for
both measures to allow their effects to be nonlinear
(e.g., Tavassoli et al. 1995). Xi. also includes the variables discussed in the data section, including ad mood,

retailer chatter, online ad spending by the retailers, and interactions among the two measures of online program engagement and the ad mood variables. Given these interactions, the coefficients for online program engagement capture the relationship between online program engagement and online shopping for the baseline ad mood category (funny ads). The correlations among the variables in Equations (2) and (3) are shown in the online appendix (Table A.5). Of note, LogPWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei are not highly correlated (0.06).
Following the identification strategy used in past research on the effects of television on online behaviors (Lewis and Reiley 2013, Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017), we use narrow time windows around the ads to better attribute changes in online shopping activity to the focal variables of interest. Because the television ad buying process restricts advertisers' control of when and where their ads will air (e.g., Katz 2013), the use of narrow time windows prevents bias in the results that could arise from advertisers choosing a certain time window to air an advertisement to impact online shopping (Liaukonyte et al. 2015). Advertisers buy the vast majority of ad time in the upfront markets, which occur months before the fall television season. At best, the ability to stipulate when a specific ad will air is restricted to the quarter-hour level; however, this timing is rarely stated in advertiser­network contracts, and even which program the ads will air on is not often stipulated (Liaukonyte et al. 2015). Networks further restrict any jurisdiction over when an ad will air by commonly ordering ads at random across commercial breaks and by using "make-good" policies that allow ads that have not reached the number of viewers paid for by the advertisers to be rerun on different programs on different days (Katz 2013, Wilbur et al. 2013). This process not only impedes advertisers control over selecting a specific program to air an ad in, but it also alleviates the concern that advertisers could time an ad to air during a specific minute-level time window to influence web traffic and sales. Additionally, given this lack of control by advertisers of when and where their ads will air, it is unlikely that advertisers could push out additional promotional materials between when their ads air and five minutes afterward that could inflate the effect sizes in our model estimation.19
Equations (1)­(3) are estimated jointly using a Bayesian hierarchical regression and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in WinBUGS. We specify µses, µpur, 1., 2., 3, and k. with diffuse normal priors. We assume that r,1 ~ N(0,1), r,2 ~ N(0,2), p,1 ~ N(0,1), and p,2 ~ N(0,2), with diffuse inversegamma priors for the variances. Last, we allow for contemporaneous covariance in T and assume it has a diffuse inverse Wishart prior. Equations (1)­(3) are

estimated jointly from three independent chain runs of 200,000 iterations, with the first 100,000 iterations discarded as a burn-in. We sample every fifth iteration, leaving our inferences based on 20,000 iterations from each chain. Model convergence was assessed using the time series plots of the posterior draws for each parameter.
5. Results
5.1 Model Comparison We use deviance information criterion (DIC), a likelihood-based measure that penalizes complex models, and mean absolute error (MAE) to compare our proposed model with three alternatives. Lower DIC and MAE indicate better model fit. We first consider a baseline model (model 1) that excludes social TV, retailer-specific effects (r.), and programspecific effects (p.). Model 2 builds on model 1 by including r. and p. We then examine the impact of social TV activity without ad mood interactions

(model 3) and with these interactions (model 4, our proposed model). The posterior mean estimates for DIC and MAE, which are shown in the online appendix (Table A.6), indicate that accounting for retailer- and program-specific effects and social TV activity is important in exploring the relationship between television advertising and online shopping activity, because these variables improve model fit. Incorporating online program engagement interactions with ad mood further improves model fit (model 4). Because model 4 is the best fitting model, we focus the results discussion on the findings from this model.

Notes. To estimate effect size for U.S. population, we transform the posterior mean estimates at each iteration to account for our original log transformation and then extrapolate our findings from comScore's panel of 100,000 U.S internet users to the number of U.S. households with internet in 2013 (91,109,500). PM, posterior mean; SD, standard deviation.
*90% highest posterior density (HDP) interval excludes zero; **95% HPD interval excludes zero.

Of note, we find that increases in online retailer chatter relate to increases in traffic to the retailers' websites in the five-minute window after the ad; however, this effect diminishes at higher values of retailer chatter

(Table 6). These results may suggest that ads that spur immediate increases in online brand chatter may also spur increases in web traffic to the brands' website. We also see some marginal evidence that ads mentioning

price20 and increases in internet search advertising spending are associated with increases in online sales. Additionally, we do not find a significant impact of audience size on online shopping. This result may occur because audience size does not meaningfully impact online shopping beyond our other model controls, such as when the ad airs and program-specific effects. This result is consistent with recent research that has found no relationship between program ratings and media multitasking activities, such as online program chatter during the program (e.g., Fossen and Schweidel 2017, Seiler et al. 2017).
We also find that when an ad airs can impact subsequent online shopping (Table 7). Ads near a half-hour interval (e.g., 8:28 P.M., 9:02 P.M.) spur more online purchases compared with ads in other time slots. Additionally, ads that air earlier in primetime (relative to ads that air between 10:45 P.M. and 10:59 P.M.) generate more subsequent traffic. We estimate that ads airing earlier in primetime can spur as much as 381 more web visits than ads airing between 10:45 P.M. and 10:59 P.M.21 We also find that ads in October and

November spur less traffic than ads in December, which may be due to the holiday season. Additionally, ads airing on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Sunday (Saturday) generate more (less) immediate traffic than ads airing on Friday, and ads in fall finale episodes generate fewer immediate online purchases than ads on other episodes. These results may be driven by the characteristics of the show and/or by the characteristics of the media multitasking behavior of viewers during these periods.
Last, for the main effects of ad mood (Table 8), we see that informational and active ads may encourage more immediate purchasing activity than funny ads. We will evaluate the ad mood interactions with social TV activity in the next section.
5.3. Is Online Program Engagement Linked to Online Traffic and Purchases?
We find that social TV activity about programs matters when assessing television advertising's impact on online shopping. In particular, we find significant interactions between online program engagement and ad mood,

suggesting that online program engagement may moderate the effect of ad mood on online shopping behavior (Table 8). If we evaluate LogPWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei separately, we find that emotional ads are more effective than funny ads at increasing immediate web traffic when the volume of social TV activity is high. Additionally, we see that higher volumes of social TV activity relate to increases in online purchases for the baseline ad mood category, funny advertisements. Emotional and sexy ads do not significantly differ in their impacts on purchases from funny ads, which may be because these ad types are similarly successful as funny ads at increasing purchases when the volume of social TV activity is high but may also be because of the small sample size of ad instances categorized by these ad mood types. We also see in Table 8 that active and informational ads are less effective at encouraging immediate online purchases than funny ads when the volume of social TV activity is high. When we evaluate the impact of the change in online program chatter immediately before an ad's airing on online purchases, we see the opposite pattern (Table 8). To consider the impact of both social TV activity measures together, we show the combined impact of these measures on online

shopping activity for different ad moods across different values of PWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei in Tables 9 and 10 and Figure 5.22 Because these effects combine the main effects of online program engagement and their interactions with ad mood, we focus our discussion on these results to assess whether social shows are good for advertisers.
For traffic to the retailers' websites, only the posterior mean estimates for emotional ads significantly differ from funny ads, the baseline mood (Table 9). Specifically, we see evidence that emotional ads spur more traffic than funny ads when they air in shows with a high volume of online program chatter leading up to the ad (PWOMVolumei) and low change in program chatter in the minute before the ad (PWOMChangei). These results are consistent with the findings in Table 8. To illustrate the effect size, if an emotional ad aired in a program when PWOMChangei = 0.5 (program chatter in the minute before the ad is half of the average program chatter volume leading up to the ad) and below average volume of program chatter (PWOMVolumei at 1st quartile), this ad would spur an estimated 719 more web visits to the retailer's website than a funny ad in the five-minute period after the ad. Holding PWOMChangei constant, if the ad aired in a program

Notes. Table 10 considers the combined impact of the measures of online program engagement without the log transformation. See endnote 22 for calculation of combined effect. Effects are relative to the baseline ad mood category (funny ads). Figure 5 shows an illustration of the estimated effect sizes associated with these posterior mean estimates.

with a higher volume of program chatter (PWOMVolumei at median), this ad would generate 1,117 more web visits than a funny ad in the five-minute period after the ad.23
For online sales, we find that funny ads generate substantial increases in purchases when they air in social shows (Table 10). This effect holds across both measures of online program engagement. We further find that emotional ads and, in most cases, sexy ads do not significantly differ from funny ads, which may be because these two ad types are as successful in social shows as funny ads in terms of increasing online purchases or because the small sample size of ad instances categorized by these ad mood types impacts significance. Although informational and active ads spur larger increases in online purchases when they air in shows with higher levels of online program engagement,24 they do not perform as well as funny ads. Figure 5 illustrates this pattern by showing the estimated effect size of the impact of online program engagement (at different levels of PWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei) on online purchases for funny, active, and informational ads.
In comparing the results when evaluating the impacts of social TV activity separately (Table 8) versus

together (Tables 9 and 10), the findings in Tables 9 and 10 are consistent with the impacts of the volume of social TV activity and the quadratic effect of the change in online program chatter in the minute before the ad airs shown in Table 8. This may indicate that these factors play an important role in evaluating the relationship between social TV activity and online shopping activity.
In summary, we find evidence that social shows benefit advertisers in terms of driving online shopping at the advertisers' website after the ad, with emotional ads spurring the largest increases in web traffic and funny ads spurring the largest increases in online sales. We also find that ads with an active or informational mood are less effective than funny ads at increasing online sales after the ad when they air in more social shows. These results may be consistent with work that has found affective ads to be more successful in capturing viewers' attention, especially relative to rational ads (e.g., Sternthal and Craig 1973, Zillmann et al. 1980, Olney et al. 1991, Eisend 2009), which may allow for the engaged processing with the program to spillover to ad processing. This argument is in line with increased show involvement enhancing viewers' opportunities to process ads

Figure 5. Estimated Effect Size of the Impact of Viewers' Online Program Engagement on Online Purchases Across Ad Mood with PWOMVolumei at Median

Notes. Figure 5 shows the estimated effect size of the combined impact of the measures of online program engagement for those ad mood categories with at least one effect size in which the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval excludes zero. This figure illustrates how the effect size changes as PWOMChangei increases and with PWOMVolumei at its median value. See endnote 22 for calculation of combined effect, and see the note under Table 6 about effect size calculation.

while concurrently reducing motivation or ability to process ads (e.g., MacInnis et al. 1991). Our results may suggest that advertisements that increase viewer attention can circumvent these potential negative impacts of increased program involvement.
5.4. Robustness Checks To analyze the robustness of the results, we estimate 59 additional models. These include considering online shopping activity from 1 to 60 minutes after the ad and varying the purchase window of LogPurchasesPostAdi from 15 minutes to 72 hours. We also estimate the model on (1) only ad creatives in which at least one web sessions initiated within five minutes of the ad generates a purchase in the next 24 hours, and (2) only ad instances in which at least one web session initiated within five minutes of the ad generates a purchase in the next 24 hours. We also estimate the model without the use of log transformations and test three alternative outcome measures (difference, percentage change, and ratio measures). Last, we estimate two models in which we combine the ad moods with less variation in terms of the number of ad instances and ad creatives. The results from all 59 of these analyses are, at a minimum, directionally consistent with our main results. These analyses are detailed in the online appendix.
6. Discussion
We explore the relationship among television advertising, social TV, and online shopping for five large

retailers and find that social shows are beneficial for advertisers, with the extent of this benefit depending on the mood of the advertisement. Our results suggest that ads with a funny or emotional mood are most effective at spurring immediate online shopping activity when they air in more social shows. Although informational and active ads also increase online shopping activity, they are less effective than ads with other moods when they air in more social shows. We also find that a number of ad design and media planning strategies can influence online shopping following ads. We discuss the implications of our results for retailers and television networks.
6.1. Implications for Retailers Our results contribute to the debate that media multitasking by television viewers is not bad news for advertisers (Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017). The primary implication from our results for retailers is that advertising in social shows may be a good strategy for increasing immediate online shopping activity, validating industry reports that social shows offer more engaged audiences (e.g., Nielsen 2015a, b). Retailers interested in leveraging the full benefits of social shows should air more affective advertisements, rather than more rational or informational ads, in social shows. These findings highlight the importance of ad mood in improving ad effectiveness in the age of media multitasking television viewers.
Our investigation provides further insights for retailers on how to improve ad design strategies to

292

Fossen and Schweidel: Social TV, Advertising, and Sales Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 274­295, © 2019 INFORMS

increase online shopping activity after the ad. Retailers should consider implementing ad design strategies that increase immediate online chatter (Fossen and Schweidel 2017), because ads that increase retailer chatter also result in subsequent increases in web traffic to the retailers' websites. Retailers should also consider referring to price in their advertisements and airing ads earlier in primetime, near half-hour breaks, between Sunday and Wednesday, and on non­fall finale episodes to increase online shopping activity after the ad. The last effect is interesting: ad time in fall finale episodes is often considered attractive to advertisers. It may be the case, however, that viewers of such episodes have difficulty redirecting their attention from the program to the ads. Such exploration may be a productive avenue for future research.
6.2. Implications for Television Networks The television industry has faced challenges in incorporating program engagement into ad buys, owing to ambiguity over its definition and its value to advertisers (e.g., Calder et al. 2009). Our findings suggest that shows with more program-related social media activity add value to advertisers by contributing to incremental web traffic and sales. These results highlight the importance of television networks having a social strategy for their shows that encourages viewers to engage in social TV. Television networks can also utilize these results to provide support as to why program engagement should be incorporated into the media buying process and to advocate for higher ad rates in their social shows. A fruitful avenue of future research may be to explore how the content of shows can increase social TV activity about the program.
6.3. Limitations and Directions for Future Research Our investigation is subject to limitations that we hope may encourage future work on media context and cross-media effects. First, our data do not allow for the direct observation of an individual viewer's online behavior or exposure to advertising and social media. Such data would allow for examinations of within-viewer variation in social TV activity, the impact of viewer characteristics on cross-media effects, and longer time windows around ads that may capture longer-term ad effects. Given the aggregate nature of our data, as in prior research on television advertising's impact on online behaviors (e.g., Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017), we exploit narrow time windows around ads to attribute changes in online program engagement to changes in online shopping activity. Although our robustness checks provide some assurance that we have limited the potential impact of confounding factors such as other marketing efforts that may coincide with television advertising, our research is subject to the limitations and challenges with

measuring television advertising effectiveness, as detailed by Lewis and Reiley (2013). Although a largescale, individual-level randomized experiment would be ideal, such experiments are not currently possible given the state of television technology (Lewis and Reiley 2013, Lewis and Rao 2015). Recent work has argued that changes in behavior in narrow time windows around a television advertisement as measured through aggregate-level, secondary data are a sound approach to measuring television advertising effectiveness that can produce results similar to a randomized experiment (e.g., Lewis and Reiley 2013, Joo et al. 2014, Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and Schweidel 2017). However, the benefits of narrow time windows for identification come with the limitation of underestimating the effect size of ad effectiveness due to excluding the possibility of longer-term impacts (Lewis and Reiley 2013).
Second, our aim is to explore whether social shows benefit advertisers, and we use measures of online program engagement to do so. As our data discussion reveals, these measures of online engagement have rich variation across episodes of a show and across shows, suggesting that program chatter during the show is not solely determined by fixed program or audience characteristics (e.g., program features, genre, network, viewer demographics). Measures of social TV activity may serve as an observable proxy for overall viewer engagement because online program engagement may correlate with offline measures of viewer engagement, such as increased attention or arousal (Nielsen 2015a). Future research may probe the extent to which offline measures of viewer engagement are also related to online (and offline) shopping behavior.
Third, our analysis is limited to five large retailers. Table A.1 in the online appendix suggests that the consumers that shopped at the retailers in our data set may deviate from the U.S. population in terms of probability to have children, education, and racial diversity. Although we demonstrate that social shows can benefit retailers in terms of online shopping, future research may consider whether this extends to other advertisers and to offline shopping. Fourth, future work may benefit from having a larger data set with more variation in key ad characteristics to further investigate moderators of social TV's impact on online shopping. Last, although some of our key results are consistent with past research, laboratory or field experiments may allow researchers to tease out the underlying behavioral mechanism driving the results in our empirical analysis.

Endnotes
1 Prior work in marketing on online shopping has used comScore data (e.g., Johnson et al. 2004, Montgomery et al. 2004, Liaukonyte et al. 2015). 2 Because of our agreement with comScore, we cannot disclose the names of the retailers. 3 Table A.1 in the online appendix provides demographic information on the comScore panel for users that visited at least one of the retailer's websites during this time period. 4 These advertising data contain only live programming in the Eastern and Central time zones, which accounts for 76% of the U.S. population (according to U.S. Census Bureau 2013 State Population Estimates). Programming in the Pacific time zone is not deemed an initial broadcasting because it airs three hours after Eastern/Central programming. The comScore data are also filtered to exclude consumers in the Pacific time zone. The granular level of the social media data, discussed next, allows us to attribute the online WOM to the Eastern/Central time zone programming. 5 Although having data for five retailers may limit the importance and generalizability of our results, the large economic importance of these retailers and diverse range of products they advertise help alleviate these concerns. 6 The correlations between monthly network television spending and these three measures of online advertising spending are as follows: network television and internet display spending 0.48, network television and internet search spending -0.00, and network television and online video spending 0.52. 7 Topsy Pro was acquired by Apple after our collection of programrelated Twitter mentions but before the collection of retailer-related mentions. Because public access to Topsy Pro was no longer available after the acquisition, we acquired data on retailer-related Twitter mentions through Crimson Hexagon. These platforms offered comparable access to public Twitter posts. The only difference is that Crimson Hexagon's minute-level volume numbers are truncated if a given search query tallies more than 10,000 posts per day. If this occurs, Crimson Hexagon reports a random sample of 10,000 posts from that day. Given this random sample, the fraction of tweets out of 10,000 occurring in a given time period before and after an ad should not be affected. Thus, a measure of change in tweets about the retailer around an ad should not be impacted by this truncation. Given this, we use a relative change measure of online retailer mentions in our model (see Table 5). 8 Coders followed Stewart and Furse (1986) to define whether ads referred to price. Initial agreement was 99% on whether the ad contained a web address and 100% on whether the ad referred to price, with differences reconciled through discussion of the ad. 9 For robustness, we test two alternative models in which we combine the ad mood types with less variation in terms of the number of ad instances and creatives. Specifically, we combine (1) emotional and sexy ads, and (2) funny, emotional, and sexy ads. The results from these models are statistically consistent with the main model (see the online appendix). 10 Note that Table 2 and Figure 1 present different visualizations of the online retailer chatter data: percentage change in online retailer mentions from the five-minute window after the ad compared with the five-minute window before the ad (Table 2) and volume of retailer mentions summed across all ad instances for a given retailer (Figure 1).

We present similar visualizations of the web traffic (online purchases) data in Table 4 and Figure 1 (Table 4 and Figure 3).
11 Additional descriptive statistics for online program chatter are shown in Figure A.1 in the online appendix, which displays the timeseries of average program mentions per minute around the ads' airings across ad position.
12 We consider both the number of transactions and products purchased (henceforth purchases) in our analysis.
13 Once a web session has been initiated, we allow 24 hours for the users to make a purchase, acknowledging that purchase decisions take time to occur once a website visit is initiated (Liaukonyte et al. 2015).
14 Conversion rate is calculated as follows: (number of sessions initiated within five minutes of an ad that generate a transaction in the next 24 hours)/(number of sessions initiated within five minutes of an ad). Liaukonyte et al. (2015) calculate conversion rates across the entire time window of their data. Although two retailers in our data have high conversion rates (19% and 25%), they are similar to Liaukonyte et al. (2015), who find a 15% conversion rate for one retailer and conversion rates exceeding 20% for three other websites. Because we consider traffic initiated immediately following an ad, we may see higher conversion rates because those consumers that go to a brand's website after the ad may have higher purchase intentions.
15 Using the same construction as LogPurchasesPostAdi, we also test transactions (LogTransPostAdi) and dollars spent (LogSpendPostAdi). The correlation between LogTransPostAdi (LogSpendPostAdi) and LogPurchasesPostAdi is 0.997 (0.940). The results from these two alternative specifications do not differ from those of the main model.
16 For robustness, we also test two sets of time-varying retailer-specific effects that vary by month and by week, respectively. The results from these two alternative specifications do not differ from those of the main model.
17 We also test variables for program genre and network. These controls were not significant, and model fit in terms of both MAE and DIC was inferior to the proposed model. Thus, these controls were excluded from Xik. 18 We take the log plus one to avoid taking the log of zero. We test several alternative specifications, including varying the time from the ad from one minute to one hour and varying the purchase consideration window for LogPurchasesPostAdi from 15 minutes to 72 hours. We also estimate the model without the log transformation on the outcomes and online shopping measures. Finally, we test three alternative specifications of the outcome measures: difference (e.g., log ((SessionsPostAdi - SessionsPreAdi) + 1)), percentage change (e.g., log ((SessionsPostAdi - SessionsPreAdi)/(SessionsPreAdi + 1))), and ratio (e.g., log(SessionsPostAdi/(SessionsPreAdi + 1))). The key results from these analyses are, at a minimum, directionally consistent and are detailed in the online appendix.
19 This argument is strongest for shorter time windows around when the ad airs. Longer time windows capture more online activity but increase concerns about the degree to which advertisers may choose when an ad airs. To assess the robustness of our findings, we test alternative time windows around when the ad airs from 1 to 60 minutes. We also test three shorter purchase consideration windows (15, 30, and 60 minutes). The results from all of these analyses are highly consistent with our main model (see the online appendix).
20 If we exclude retailer-specific effects, mentioning price relates to significant increases in both online traffic and purchases, with the 95% credible intervals excluding zero.
21 To illustrate the effect size of our results beyond comScore's panel of 100,000 active U.S. internet users, we extrapolate our findings from the panel to the 91,109,500 estimated households in the United States that had internet in 2013 (United States Census Bureau 2013, File and Ryan 2014) to assess what the effects might be for the U.S. population.

22 This combined effect sums the ad mood effect and linear and quadratic effect for both online program engagement measures. As an example, for active mood in the online purchases equation, it is calculated as 3,2 + 7,2*PWOMVolumei + 8,2*PWOMVolumei2 + 9,2*PWOMChangei + 10,2*PWOMChangei2 for the different values of PWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei. 23 See note under Table 6 about effect size calculations. 24 The magnitude of the positive posterior mean estimates of the baseline category funny ads is larger than the magnitude of the negative posterior mean estimates for informational and active ads. For informational ads (active ads), these effects have larger positive magnitudes at higher values of PWOMVolumei and PWOMChangei (higher values of PWOMVolumei).
