Online reverse auctions generate real-time bidding data that could be used via appropriate statistical estimation to assist the corporate buyer's procurement decision. To this end, we develop a method, called BidAnalyzer, which estimates dynamic bidding models and selects the most appropriate of them. Specifically, we enable model estimation by addressing the problem of partial observability; i.e., only one of N suppliers' bids is realized, and the other (N - 1) bids remain unobserved. To address partial observability, BidAnalyzer estimates the latent price distributions of bidders by applying the Kalman filtering theory. In addition, BidAnalyzer conducts model selection by applying multiple information criteria. Using empirical data from an automotive parts auction, we illustrate the application of BidAnalyzer by estimating several dynamic bidding models to obtain empirical insights, retaining a model for forecasting, and assessing its predictive performance in out-ofsample. The resulting one-step-ahead price forecast is accurate up to 2.95% median absolute percentage error. Finally, we suggest how BidAnalyzer can serve as a device for price discovery in online reverse auctions.

1. Introduction
More than 30% of the major companies who annually purchase more than $100 million use online reverse auctions for procurement (Beall et al. 2003). These buyers belong to various sectors, ranging from manufacturing to consumer goods to high-tech. In these auctions, suppliers bid (instead of buyers), pushing prices down (instead of up) over time and generating real-time bidding data. The resulting data could be used for decision making, but managers need " statistical estimation techniques for effectively mining data generated by auctions to predict behavior and to dynamically improve operational decisions" (Pinker et al. 2003, p. 1,481). To this end, we develop a method, which we call BidAnalyzer, for assisting a corporate buyer's procurement decision. Specifically, our research objective is to develop a method for (a) estimating dynamic bidding models and (b) selecting an appropriate one from models with different drift specifications or cross-bidder dependence.
An inherent feature of bidding data from online reverse auctions is partial observability; i.e., the buyer observes a bid price from one of the suppliers at a point in time but no bids from the rest of the participating suppliers. Because only one of N suppliers' bids is observable, there are (N - 1) missing

observations every period. If each supplier's bid price were observed every period, we could have applied standard time-series models (e.g., vector autoregressions) to understand the dynamics of bid prices over time. However, the data-generating process in online reverse auction does not comport with this implicit assumption (of complete observability) made in standard time-series models (namely, all elements of the multivariate dependent variables are observable in every period). Hence, to address partial observability, state-space models provide a reasonable starting point, and so we apply Kalman filtering theory (see, e.g., Durbin and Koopman 2001 for details). Furthermore, we apply information theory (see, e.g., Burnham and Anderson 2002) to conduct nonnested model selection.
To illustrate the application of BidAnalyzer, we use bidding data from an automotive reverse auction in which ten suppliers competed in nine different lots and the total transaction was valued at $8.2 million at the final bid prices. These bidding data serve as inputs to BidAnalyzer, which estimates several dynamic bidding models. Based on the estimated models, we obtain empirical insights as follows: bid prices follow the random walk with a negative drift, revealing that the suppliers' valuations evolve over time rather than

remain fixed (i.e., the latent price distribution is nonstationary). In other words, each supplier adjusts its latent price distribution downwards based on the bid prices observed thus far across all the suppliers and not just its own prices. The drift rate within lots can depend on the time elapsed since the start, the interbid hiatus, and the remaining time until the auction ends. The drift rate between lots varies proportional to the average price drop but not the number of bidders. In addition, the bidding patterns exhibit crosssupplier dependence, which can be detected by the BidAnalyzer across a few specific subsets of suppliers.
Finally, to assess predictive performance, we compare one-step-ahead price forecasts with the actual bid prices. Specifically, we estimate the model parameters using bidding data from other lots excluding the data from the lot under consideration, which serves as the holdout sample. Then we generate one-stepahead price forecasts for each lot iteratively. For lots with high or low valuations, respectively, Figures 2 and 3 present the BidAnalyzer's forecasts and actual prices. Overall, the price forecast is accurate up to 2.95% median absolute percentage error.
Given that BidAnalyzer infers the latent price distributions for every supplier, managers could embed this information in an optimization algorithm for price discovery in online reverse auctions. This capability would enable the buyer to understand whether a given supplier has bid aggressively or held back cautiously. In the latter case, the supplier may become a candidate for postauction discussions. Note that a buyer typically does not ask every bidder to lower the prices further after the auction ends because this action is perceived as unethical. Hence, buyers need to discover a subset of candidate suppliers whose final bids exceed the prices that maximize the suppliers' expected profit and then approach them selectively.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature, and §3 describes the auction format. Section 4 provides a nontechnical overview of how BidAnalyzer works, and §5 presents the mathematical details of distributional inference, parameter estimation, and model selection. Section 6 illustrates an empirical application. Section 7 discusses extensions of BidAnalyzer and identifies avenues for further research.
2. Literature Review
Extant research in the auctions literature tends to ignore price dynamics within the course of the auction, focusing instead on the final bid (for reviews, see Klemperer 1999, McAfee and McMillan 1987) or summary statistics of bidding behavior such as the number of bids (Ariely and Simonson 2003, Wilcox 2000),

the rate of bid submission (Häubl and PopkowskiLeszczyc 2006, Katok and Kwasnica 2002, Tuunainen et al. 2001), and price concessions (Ariely and Simonson 2003, Heyman et al. 2004, Ku et al. 2005). These approaches aggregate over the temporal dimension and explain cross-sectional variation across various auctions.
In marketing, research on price dynamics within auctions is emerging. For example, Bapna et al. (2004) apply functional data analysis to online consumer auctions. They estimate the first and second derivatives (i.e., velocity and acceleration) of the price path over time and relate them to auction characteristics at various stages of the auction. For instance, they find that the rate of price increase due to the entry of an additional bidder is smaller at the end rather than the beginning of the auction. In the BidAnalyzer, we will incorporate this role of price velocity via the drift rate, whereas acceleration can be specified by the first difference in drift rate (see Footnote 2).
In a recent study, Park et al. (2003) develop a model to understand consumer bidding behavior in Internet auctions (also see Bradlow and Park 2007). In such consumer auctions, entry is open to any consumer; approximately 44% of the bids arrive after 90% of an auction's duration has passed; and 90% of the auctions have a "buy-it-now" feature (i.e., any bidder can stop the auction immediately and buy the good for the stated price), which becomes one of the key determinants of the final price. Structurally, this auction design and the resulting data generation differ from those of business-to-business reverse auctions, where only qualified suppliers are selected for participation; bids arrive throughout an auction's duration with no snipping because of soft close (i.e., moving end time); and the buy-it-now pricing is not available. Thus, business-to-business reverse auctions are qualitatively different from consumer auctions, and, to best of our knowledge, this study marks the first application of state-space models to predict price dynamics within an online reverse auction.
3. The Online Reverse Auction Context
Jap (2002) provides a general overview of the conditions, structure, and evaluation of online reverse auctions. Several studies describe the implementation of the online reverse auction process from preliminary steps to contract awards (see Emiliani 2000, Mabert and Skeels 2002, Stein et al. 2003).
In this study, the online reverse auction commences after the buyer qualifies--through visits, questionnaires, and research--the short list of viable suppliers. Then the auctioneer, who hosts and manages the event, posts the buyer's request for purchase (RFP) on a website and invites the qualified suppliers to respond to

Jap and Naik: BidAnalyzer: A Method for Estimation and Selection of Dynamic Bidding Models

951

the RFP. The RFP contains the product and delivery specifications, contract expectations, and the rules of the auction event as follows: supplier bids are legally binding, the buyer reserves the right to select the final winner, and the lowest bid price is not guaranteed to win the contract. The buyer also commits not to bid against suppliers in the auction (an unethical practice known as "shilling"). The suppliers do not know who their competitors are or how many suppliers will bid against them. The products are neither pure commodities nor highly customized strategic parts. All the products are used in production or for parts in production. The buyer creates subgroups of multiple items, called lots, which represent a set of items grouped according to the suppliers' capabilities to produce or based on similarities in manufacturing processes or delivery regions. Moreover, the buyer expects that suppliers have the capability to produce all of the items within that lot, and so each lot is auctioned independently. In other words, no bids are accepted for partial lots or individual parts within a lot.
Once the auction starts, suppliers view their competitor's bid price and respond in real time. The auction for each lot ends with a soft close, which means that the closing time extends for a few minutes to allow other suppliers to respond if any bid arrives in the last minute of the closing time (i.e., no snipping). Bidders see only the price bids of competing bidders; they do not see other nonprice factors of competing bidders.1 After the auction, the buyer evaluates the individual bids and considers their nonprice attributes of interest. In the subsequent four to six weeks, the buyer reviews the bids with other functional units in the organization and may negotiate prices with some subset of suppliers. Finally, the buyer notifies all suppliers whether they won or lost the auction.

4. How BidAnalyzer Works
Figure 1 presents the schematic representation of BidAnalyzer, which takes the bidding data as inputs, analyzes them via the three modules--distributional inference, model estimation, and model selection-- and creates several outputs. Below we explain the three modules in turn without technical details, which are provided in the next section.

4.1. Bidding Data

To characterize the main properties of the data,

in Table 1, we display the bid prices from a real

online reverse auction, which attracted 19 suppliers,

labeled as {S1, S2

S19}, who competed for the con-

tract worth more than one million dollars. This auc-

tion commenced with an opening bid of $1,809,970,

1 For research on combinatorial bidding, see Hohner et al. (2003), Metty et al. (2005), Sandholm et al. (2006), and Sheffi (2004).

led to decreasing bid prices over time, generated a total of 45 bids, although not all suppliers submitted their bids, and ended with the minimum bid of $1,478,880. The drop in price was $331,090 (i.e., approximately 22%).
The sequence of bid prices exemplifies the fundamental problem of partial observability; i.e., only one bidder of the 19 bidders submits a bid at any point in time, t. More specifically, for time point t = 1 in Table 1, the fifteenth bidder (i.e., S15) quoted $1,809,970, while all other 18 suppliers present in this auction at that time did not submit bids. This feature of partial observability--we observe only one bid price from some bidder Sj (j = 1 N = 19) and do not observe bids from the other suppliers--holds at every time point (t = 1 45). By denoting × for no bidding activity, Table 1 shows the bidding pattern from the supplier S1's point of view. Partial observability is a critical feature of the input data because it impacts our ability to infer the probability distribution from which a supplier's bid price arises, as we explain next.

4.2. Distributional Inference

For clarity, consider the first time point and sup-

pose a supplier j's bid arises from the normal dis-

tribution, N

j

2 j

.

Based

on

the

first

observed

bid

of $1,809,970, what can we say about the bidder's

(i.e., S15) latent price distribution N

15

2 15

that

generated this outcome? Using sample moments as

estimators, we can say that 15 = 1 809 970, but we

cannot estimate

2 15

with

just

one

observation.

In

addi-

tion, we can say nothing about the nonbidders' price

distributions N j

2 j

for every j

other than j = 15.

Thus, because of partial observability, standard time-

series techniques such as autoregressive integrated

moving average (ARIMA) or vector autoregression

(VARs) are unable to infer these price distributions.

To resolve this problem, we apply state-space meth-

ods (see Durbin and Koopman 2001) to characterize

the latent price distribution of every supplier at each

point in time (for details, see §5.2).

4.3. Model Estimation The capability to infer distributions is critical for computing the likelihood function required for estimating dynamic bidding models. In other words, model estimation cannot proceed via only the observed bidding data; it depends also on the probability distributions of bid prices. In Figure 1, we show this dependence by the forward arrow () between distributional inference and model estimation. Conceptually, the capability to infer the price distributions allows

BidAnalyzer to progress by estimating hypothesized dynamic models. To be able to infer price distributions, however, we need to know the parameter values of a hypothesized model. Because we do not know the parameter values a priori, we iterate between the inference and estimation modules as indicated by the backward arrow () in Figure 1. At convergence, we obtain both the inferred distributions and the estimated models (for details, see §5.3).
4.4. Model Selection Applying BidAnalyzer to actual bidding data, buyers can estimate several dynamic models {M1, M2 ML}, where Ml denotes a dynamic bidding model (l = 1 L). To select a model, we balance the trade-off between parsimony (i.e., simple model) and fidelity (i.e., best-fitting model) by minimizing the Kullback­ Leibler (K-L) distance between the candidate and true models (see §5.4). As Figure 1 shows, the module for model selection advances us further from model estimation to the retention of a specific model for decision making.
4.5. Outputs The three modules--inference, estimation, and selection--together comprise BidAnalyzer, which takes bidding data as inputs and creates the following outputs: (i) price distributions for every bidder in each point in time; (ii) parameter estimates and their significance (see §§5.3 and 6.2); and (iii) a specific retained model (see §§4.4 and 5.4). In practice, managers can embed the latent price distributions from (i) in an optimization algorithm to discover optimal prices for each supplier and then make informed procurement decisions.

5. Method Development
In this section, we present the mathematical details of BidAnalyzer in the following order: dynamic bidding models, distributional inference, model estimation, and model selection.

5.1. Bidding Dynamics

Here we address the partial observability problem

inherent in bidding data. Let N suppliers participate

in an online reverse auction, and, at any time t, a sup-

plier j submits a bid pt. This observed price is a noisy

signal from the supplier j's latent price distribution

j t

so that

pt =

j t

+

t

(1)

where t  N 0

2 . We can think of

j t

as

the

sup-

plier j's unobserved valuation at time t. We reexpress

this equation as

pt = zt t + t

(2)

Jap and Naik: BidAnalyzer: A Method for Estimation and Selection of Dynamic Bidding Models

953

where the indicator vector zt = 0 1 0 has unity at the jth element (for the bidder j) and zeros

elsewhere for the nonbidders, and t =

1 t

N t

is the N × 1 vector containing the latent price distri-

butions of all the suppliers.

The zeros in zt capture the phenomenon of partial

observability. Specifically, when the jth supplier sub-

mits its bid, its price distribution

j t

is

partly

revealed

via the observed price, whereas the price distribu-

tions of all other suppliers remain hidden because

they did not bid at time t. More precisely, the par-

tial observability of vector t means that one element of t is observed, while the other (N - 1) elements
are not. Furthermore, the composition of vector zt is
time-varying because different suppliers bid at differ-

ent instants.

Because observed price declines over time in re-

verse auctions, we formulate the following speci-

fication (which can be modified as shown in the

appendix):

j t

=

j t-1

+

+

j t

j =1

N

(3)

where is the drift rate and the error vector t  N 0 . The specification = 2I implies indepen-

dence across bidders; we capture correlated bidding

by relaxing off-diagonal elements to be nonzero (see

appendix).

We expect the drift rate to be negative in reverse

auctions. However, if the drift in bid prices is not con-

stant, we can replace it by heterogeneous drifts across lots or by time-varying drift within a lot.2 For exam-

ple, bidding can be brisk at the start of an auction,

meanders in the middle, and becomes aggressive near

the end. BidAnalyzer can incorporate such dynamic

effects (see appendix).

Equation (3) constitutes a set of multiple time-

series, not just one scalar equation. So we reexpress (3)

as the system of N equations

which permits the compact vector representation

t = t-1 + + t

(4)

2 Note that the drift rate, which equals the change in latent prices, can be viewed as velocity (Bapna et al. 2004). Consequently, the acceleration, which equals the change in velocity, can be specified by t = t-1 + X + t, and these additional dynamics can be subsumed within the state-space model by augmenting the state vector to be ~ t = t t .

Next, we explain how the buyer learns about the suppliers' evolving valuation (i.e., the latent price distributions) as the auction progresses.

5.2. Inferring Price Distributions

The bidding activity generates information on the bid

amount and bidder's identity, which are denoted by

(pt zt), respectively. As the auction progresses, this

information accumulates in the information set t =

p1 z1 p2 z2

pt zt . How should we use this

information in t to infer price distributions in t =

1 t

N t

?

To this end, let 0  N 0 0 denote the ini-

tial distribution, where 0 and 0 are the vector of

means and covariance matrix, respectively. Before the

first bid arrives, at t = 1, the moments of 1 can be obtained from (4) as follows:

1 0=E 1 0 = 0+ 0

(5)

1 0 = Var 1 0 = 0 +

where ( 1 0 1 0) are the means and covariance of 1 based on the information set 0.3
After the first bid arrives at t = 1, we learn the bid
amount and the bidder's identity, (p1 z1), which we use to update the above moments of 1

1 1 = E 1 1 = 1 0 + 1 p1 - z1 1 0

(6)

1 1 = Var 1 1 = I - 1z1 1 0

where 1 = 0  p1 z1 is the augmented information set, and 1 = 1 0z1/ z1 1 0z1 + 2 is an N × 1 vector.
The intuition for this updating is as follows: Adjust
the means 1 0 proportional to the difference between observed and expected bid prices (p1 - z1 1 0). The vector 1 contains the proportionality constants, which follow from the Bayes theorem (see, e.g., Durbin and
Koopman 2001).
At the end of the first time point, the price distribu-
tion for all of the suppliers--not just the one who submitted the bid--is given by 1  N 1 1 1 1 . Before the second bid arrives, the moments of 2 conditional on the known information in 1 are given by

2 1=E 2 1 = 1+ 1

(7)

2 1 = Var 2 1 = 1 +

As the new bid arrives at t = 2, (p2 z2), we update the moments via Bayes theorem as follows:

where

2 2 = E 2 2 = 2 1 + 2 p2 - z2 2 1

(8)

2 2 = Var 2 2 = I - 2z2 2 1

2 = 1  p2 z2 and 2 = 2 1z2/ z2 2 1z2 + 2 .

3 In the subscript 1 0, the index before the vertical slash refers to the time point for the random variable , and the index after the slash indicates the time point for the information set used in evaluating the expectations.

Over the course of the entire auction, bids arrive at time points t = 1 T , and we process them recur-
sively to learn about the mean and covariance of t via the four equations

t t-1 = E t t-1 = t-1 + t-1 t t-1 = Var t t-1 = t-1 +
(9) t t = E t t = t t-1 + t pt - zt t t-1
t t = Var t t = I - tzt t t-1

where t = t t-1zt/ zt t t-1zt + 2 . This set of four equations in (9) yields the distributional inference on

t for all t. In sum, as the reverse auction progresses, we

receive information sequentially on the bid amount

and bidder identity pt zt t = 1 T . Using (9), we infer the sequence of moments t t t t t =
1 T , thus learning about the latent price dis-

tributions for all of the suppliers. Thus, for each

supplier in every period, a supplier's valuation (i.e.,

its latent price distribution) depends on the bids of

all of the suppliers thus far and not just its own

bids. To see this point, note that the conditioning in

(9) uses the information set t, which equals t =

t-1  pt zt , and, on recursive substitution, it yields

the entire history of prices and bidders: t = 0 

pt zt pt-1 zt-1

p2 z2 p1 z1 .

In practice, the buyer does not know the magni-

tudes of the initial means, the drift rates, or the error

variances, and hence BidAnalyzer estimates them

using actual bidding patterns observed in a given auc-

tion, as we describe next.

5.3. Model Estimation

A typical auction consists of several lots, k =

1 K. A lot represents a grouping of individual

parts created by the buyer based on factors such

as similarities in manufacturing processes, size, or

location. In each lot k, suppliers' bidding activity

generates the price trajectory p1k p2k

pTk . Let

f p1k p2k

pTk denote the joint density function

and f ptk p1k

pt-1 k = f ptk t-1 k be the con-

ditional density function.4 Then, the likelihood func-

tion is given by

Lk = f p1k p2k

pT k

= f p1k f p2k p1k f p3k p1k p2k

· · · · f pTk p1k

pT -1 k

4 The proposed approach can be adapted to estimate continuoustime models using discrete-time data by integrating the transition equations in (4) forward in time until the data are observed; for details, see Naik et al. (2005, §4, p. 29).

(10)

where Tk is the total number of bids in lot k, and

the set t k = p1k z1k p2k z2k

ptk ztk con-

tains information up to time t in lot k. The informa-

tion set 0k contains the initial means 0k, which differ across the nine lots but are constant across bidders.

Next, to find the moments of f ptk t-1 k , we make use of the result (9) and model (2). Specifi-

cally, the mean and variance, respectively, are given

by E ptk t-1 k = ztk t t-1 k and Var ptk t-1 k = ztk t t-1 kztk + 2, which fully characterizes the normal density f ptk t-1 k . Hence, we can compute the likelihood Lk via (10), which we sum across all the lots to compute the total log-likelihood:

L = Ln Lk

Finally, we maximize (11) with respect to to obtain the maximum-likelihood estimates

5.4. Information-Theoretic Model Selection

A buyer can specify several dynamic models

M1 M2

ML and estimate each one of them via

the above estimation approach. To retain a specific

model, we compute the Kullback­Leibler (K-L) dis-

tance metric and select the model that attains the

smallest value (for further details, see Burnham and

Anderson 2002). An approximation of the K-L met-

ric is given by Akaike's information criterion AIC =

-2L + 2p, where L is the maximized log-likelihood

value and p is the number of parameters in . As

model complexity increases, both L and p increase;

thus, AIC balances the trade-off between goodness-

of-fit and parsimony.

Because AIC ignores the sample size B = k Tk, we use its bias-corrected version for finite samples (Hurvich and Tsai 1989) and the Bayesian information criterion.5 By using multiple criteria, we gain convergent validity when these criteria retain the same model, thus enhancing confidence. If multiple criteria retain different models, however, then AICC is preferred when the p/B ratio is large (i.e., many parameters or small sample sizes) and BIC when the p/B ratio is small (see Naik et al. 2007, Remark 2 and Table 2). The next section illustrates the application of BidAnalyzer to real bidding data.
6. Empirical Illustration
6.1. Bidding Data A major parts manufacturer in the automotive industry provided the bidding data for this study. This company operates in 25 countries with sales revenue exceeding $15 billion. It wanted to buy metal parts for use in its production process and invited ten qualified suppliers to participate in the online auction. These ten suppliers competed in nine different lots and generated 403 bids, and this transaction was valued at $8.2 million at the final bid prices.
6.2. Estimation of Model Parameters We first estimate the model specified by Equations (2) and (3), assuming bidders are identical and independent (i.e., = 2I). We later consider the general case of correlated bidding dynamics (see appendix). Table 2 reports the parameter estimates and t-values, which were obtained using Equations (12) and (13). All parameter estimates, except for one of the error variances, are significant at the 95% confidence level. For example, the initial means 0k for each lot k are
5 The bias-corrected AICC = -2L + B B + p / B - p - 2 and BIC = -2L + pLn B .

significant; they represent the bidders' common valuation for each lot. In addition, the estimated drift is negative and significant in a one-tailed test. That is, bid prices decrease by a fixed amount as the auction evolves such that the longer the bidding lasts, the lower the final bid prices. Given the average bid price of $1,314,312, this estimated drift indicates that bid prices drop by 1% for every additional bid. Thus bid prices follow the random walk with a negative drift, revealing that the suppliers' valuations evolve over time rather than remain fixed.
6.3. Cross-Validation of Price Forecasts To assess BidAnalyzer's predictive performance, we reestimate the constant drift model for the high-value lots (>$1 million) and low-value lots (<$100,000). Specifically, for each lot type (low or high value), we use bidding data from all similar lots except the one under consideration, which serves as the holdout sample. In other words, we generate bid-price forecasts in the lot under consideration without using bidding data from that lot to estimate the model's parameters. The initial mean for a lot is its opening bid (or one could set it to the current price of an incumbent supplier). The forecasted price is the weighted average of the expected prices from all bidders, where the weights depend on their bidding frequency6 and the expected prices are based on the prior mean t t-1 given in Equation (9). We also forecast the 95% price interval based on the prior covariance matrix t t-1 given in Equation (9).
Using the reestimated model, we next forecast the price we expect to observe. As the actual bid arrives, we realize the inaccuracy of BidAnalyzer's forecast. So we update the price distribution for each bidder (using Equation (9)) and forecast again both the bid price and price interval for the next time point. We repeat the two steps--forecast and update--until the bidding in that lot ends.
Figures 2 and 3 display the predicted 95% price interval before the actual bid was observed for highand low-value lots, respectively. For comparison, we also show the actual bid price. Initially, BidAnalyzer misses a few bids, from which it learns; later on, it tracks even the turning points quite well. It is important to emphasize that, when estimating the model parameters, we did not use the price information in the lot under consideration. Yet the actual bid prices are usually within the predicted price interval. Moreover, the median absolute percentage deviation between the forecasts and actual prices is 2.95%. Finally, to obtain empirical insights, BidAnalyzer can
6 The weights are given by wjt = sjt + 1 / nt + 10 , where sjt is the number of times the bidder j cast a bid out of the total number of bids nt observed thus far at time t, t = 1 Tk.

7. Discussion and Conclusions
This paper presents an approach to estimate and select dynamic bidding models using point-by-point data from reverse auctions. The methodological development marks an important and necessary step for improving the buyer's price discovery process in

online reverse auctions. Specifically, using the esti-

mated latent price distribution

j T

from

BidAnalyzer,

the buyer can compute the chance that the sup-

plier j wins the contract if it offers the price bj

(i.e., P

j T

> bj

).

If

bj

is

too

high,

the

supplier

would

make a large profit but risks losing the contract

(because its selection probability decreases). On the

other hand, if bj is too low, the supplier increases its selection probability but would earn less profit.

fies the dynamics (e.g., suppliers' evolving valuation). Additional hierarchies can be introduced, or example, serial correlation in errors (see Naik and Raman 2003, pp. 384­385); such hierarchies also are subsumed within the Equation (4) itself by properly augmenting the state vector t (e.g., see Footnote 2). In other words, the two-level state-space models not only accommodate multi-level hierarchies (e.g., see Frühwirth-Schnatter 2006, Ch. 13) but also offer many other advantages (for details, see Dekimpe et al. 2008).
Three methods exist to estimate hierarchical dynamic models: maximum likelihood (e.g., Naik et al. 1998), EM algorithm (Shumway and Stoffer 1982), and Bayesian approach (e.g., Bass et al. 2007). The maximum-likelihood method uses the Kalman filter algorithm, whereas both the EM and Bayesian methods require the Kalman filter and Kalman smoother algorithms. The Kalman filter uses price information thus far (i.e., it does not require future prices until the auction ends), whereas Kalman smoother uses all the price information up to the final bid pT at every intermediate time point t (t = 1 T - 1). In other words, the Kalman (forward) filter infers the suppliers' valuations of the lot given the past and current prices and generates price forecast as the auction progresses in real time; the Kalman (backward) smoother interpolates the suppliers' valuations given the past, current, and future prices after the auction ends. Hence, we apply maximum-likelihood estimation so that users have the flexibility to update price forecasts during the course of the auction, and we encourage researchers to investigate other merits of the alternative estimation approaches (e.g., shrinkage).

We close by identifying additional avenues for research. BidAnalyzer can be used to understand how supplier characteristics such as manufacturing capabilities, past history with the buyer, or dedicated investments affect the bidding strategy. It can be extended to estimate the latent price distributions by conditioning on the supplier being a bidder in the t-th time point. Analytical researchers can introduce the role of competition across sequential lots to determine the optimal price path (e.g., Oren and Rothkopf 1975, Zeithammer 2006) or study the suppliers' decisions not to bid between different lots, making the entry decision endogenous (e.g., Seshadri et al. 1991). We acknowledge the limitation of our research, which assumes that the rules of online reverse auctions are pre-determined (Shugan 2005); future research may investigate how such rules themselves get set or should be reset for different target groups or desired goals (e.g., liquidity). We believe that such efforts would further improve the theory and practice of online procurement and marketing.

7Estimates and t-values are as follows: 1 = 0 0035 1 78 , 2 = -0 0778 -1 03 , 3 = 0 0007 0 03 . Although the individual effects are insignificant when considered separately (via t-values), the joint effect of the three time-varying covariates is significant compared to the heterogeneous drift model (in
which the drift remains constant within each lot) because the latter model attains higher scores on the information criteria (see Table 5). 8We must ensure that (i) every correlation is a positive or negative fraction (i.e., ij  -1 1 ); (ii) the correlation matrix is positive definite; (iii) and the
correlation matrix is symmetric (i.e., ij = ji ). The specification = L × L satisfies these three properties in every trial parameter value of the iterative search process (i.e., not just at the final converged estimates).
