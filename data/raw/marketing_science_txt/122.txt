Abstract. Consumers may incur deliberation costs in learning about their valuations for new products. When the deliberation cost is not trivial, the retailer may set a low price to inhibit deliberation (regressive pricing) or choose a high price to induce deliberation (transgressive pricing). In a decentralized channel, we find that, first, the retailer is more likely to adopt the regressive pricing (versus transgressive pricing) when the wholesale price is lower. In response, the manufacturer sets a high (low) wholesale price to induce the transgressive (regressive) pricing when the deliberation cost is intermediate (high). Second, channel members can be misaligned in the incentive in investing in consumer empowerment. The ability to empower consumers and reduce their deliberation costs enhances the retailer's channel power and its share of channel profit. Finally, the manufacturer may offer a socially suboptimal product quality because a high quality can lead to excessive deliberation. These nontrivial effects of the deliberation cost underscore the importance of considering consumer deliberations in channel management. The insights are robust under a positive production cost, heterogeneous deliberation costs, continuous deliberation efforts, and a channel structure with multiple layers.

You might think of consumption as a fairly passive

activity, but buying new products and services is ac-

tually pretty risky, at least if you value your time and

money.

1. Introduction
An effective distribution strategy for a new product requires successful coordination of channel members in the provision of key channel functions. Among them, product information stands at the top of the list, especially for products that are technically complex and susceptible to rapid technological changes (Rangan et al. 1992). Because these products are new to the market, consumers have had no previous experience with the new features or technologies and are therefore uncertain about how the products can be valuable to them. Any attempt to resolve the uncertainty will require expensive efforts by the consumers. For example, when Huawei launched its Mate 10 smartphone in 2017, the company's advertisement highlighted the Kirin 970: "World's first Kirin AI [artificial intelligence] processor." With the new processor, the phone "can not only see and hear, but also think." Supported by strong chip processing capabilities,

the Mate 10 could be more cognitive of user needs and provide truly personalized and readily accessible services.2 However, because the mobile AI platform was completely new to the market, consumers would need to find out the specific benefits of the new technology and how these benefits could be relevant to them. For example, the Kirin 970 offered super fast object recognition and could enable automatic mode selection. At the same time, AI features could raise privacy concerns; "for some consumers AI features felt unnatural or `creepy'" (Reigh 2017, Rutherford 2017). As one of Huawei's senior managers wondered, "whether its advantages would result in benefits consumers perceived relevant to them was yet to be seen" (Ofek et al. 2018). Consider another example: When drones were first introduced to the market, potential buyers had no prior experience of aerial photography or surveillance. They would have found it difficult to assess the exact values of features such as flying range and obstacle avoidance. Consumers would have needed to simulate the specific contexts of using drones and find out the relevance of benefits from these features. The cost of such thinking

efforts, defined as deliberation cost, has been well documented in the literature (e.g., Shugan 1980).
Recently, researchers have begun to investigate the implications of the deliberation cost on a seller's marketing decisions. Research shows that a seller may strategically induce or inhibit a consumer's deliberation efforts through decisions on price and consumer empowerment (Wathieu and Bertini 2007) or quality decisions in a product line (Guo and Zhang 2012). However, how deliberation cost may affect a manufacturer's decisions and channel relations in a decentralized channel remains an unanswered question. For a consumer product, the retailer controls the retail interface and directly influences consumer deliberation through retail price and empowerment activities such as store displays and sales assistance. But the manufacturer can use the wholesale price to sway the retail decisions and indirectly influence consumer deliberation. Furthermore, the manufacturer can affect the consumer's deliberation decision and the retailer's responses through product-related decisions such as product quality (Guo and Zhang 2012). For instance, by offering a higher quality, the manufacturer can increase the uncertainty of value and hence the expected benefits of consumer deliberation.
This paper studies the effects of deliberation cost in a decentralized channel, where a manufacturer sells a product to a retailer at a wholesale price. The retailer then chooses a retail price and resells the product to consumers. Such a distribution channel is common; for example, Huawei sold its Mate 10 smartphone through Best Buy in the North American market. To be consistent with the extant literature, our assumptions on consumer behavior and hence the results on retail pricing are very similar to those of Wathieu and Bertini (2007). The model assumes that individual product valuations become more dispersed after consumers deliberate. Given the cost of deliberation, it is optimal for consumers to deliberate if and only if the market price falls into an intermediate range (thought-provoking prices). If the retail price is very low, the consumers will buy without deliberation (no-brainer purchases). If the retail price is very high, they will neither deliberate nor purchase. Thus, the retailer can either price very low to inhibit deliberation and sell to the entire market (regressive pricing strategy) or price in the middle range to induce deliberation and sell only to those consumers who realize high private valuations after deliberation (transgressive pricing strategy).
We examine the decisions of the manufacturer who correctly anticipates the above effects of deliberation cost on the behavior of the retailer and consumers. We find that the optimal wholesale price depends on the consumer deliberation cost. In the absence of deliberation cost, the manufacturer and the retailer each choose an

optimal margin to maximize their individual profits; this process of double marginalization leads to a retail price higher than the channel-optimal price. With consumer deliberation cost, the retailer no longer simply responds to the wholesale price with a retail margin. Instead, it chooses between the regressive and transgressive pricing strategies to influence consumers' deliberation decisions. Given the deliberation cost, the retailer is more likely to choose regressive pricing (versus transgressive pricing) when the wholesale price is lower. In anticipation of such retailer behavior, the manufacturer charges a low wholesale price to induce the regressive pricing when the deliberation cost is high. If the deliberation cost is intermediate, the manufacturer charges a high wholesale price to induce the transgressive pricing. Thus, the wholesale price serves the dual function of allocating the channel profit shared with the retailer and influencing the retail price to obtain the preferred level of consumer deliberation. We find the above results to be robust when we extend the model to consider positive production costs, heterogeneous deliberation costs, continuous deliberation efforts, and a channel structure with additional layers of channel intermediaries.
The deliberation cost changes the balance of power between channel members. On the one hand, deliberation cost creates a ceiling for the retail price above which the consumers will neither deliberate nor purchase (no-brainer no purchase). As a result, when the wholesale price is high, the retailer loses pricing flexibility and cannot obtain a proper retail margin. Relatively speaking, when the deliberation cost goes up, this price ceiling moves down, and the retailer becomes less powerful. On the other hand, the retailer gains power from managing the channel interface and directly influencing the consumers' deliberation decision. When the retailer can choose from the transgressive and regressive pricing strategies, the manufacturer has to give enough incentive through a low wholesale price to direct the retailer to the regressive pricing. Such a power gain for the retailer reaches its maximum when the deliberation cost is at a moderate level. Combining these two effects, we find that the manufacturer's profit increases with the deliberation cost, but the retailer's profit peaks at a moderate level of deliberation cost.
In practice, both the upstream and downstream companies could engage in consumer empowerment activities to reduce deliberation costs (Wathieu and Bertini 2007). Best Buy can provide point-of-purchase demonstrations to project consumers into usage scenarios, and train its Geek Squad to explain the benefits of AI processors in different contexts. As consumers project themselves into specific user experiences, they will find it much easier to evaluate the benefits and assess the personal relevance of new technologies. Manufacturers can also

empower consumers through online communications. In the drone market, a manufacturer can produce videos describing possible uses. For instance, DJI, the world's largest drone manufacturer, posted a video showing that its Phantom 4 drone can fly up and close to a volcano and take shots of lava. This benefit could be very relevant for some landscape photographers, but not as much for most recreational users. Our results indicate that the manufacturer and retailer have different incentives in engaging consumer empowerment. Overall, a retailer's ability to reduce deliberation cost increases the retailer's power and its share of channel profit. If the production cost is low, the manufacturer may prefer not to reduce the deliberation cost. In this case, the manufacturer would offer a low wholesale price to induce a low retail price and nobrainer consumer purchases. However, if the production cost is very high and close to the expected value without deliberation, then the manufacturer may consider reducing deliberation cost through its direct-toconsumer empowerment activities.
Finally, the consideration of deliberation cost can change the manufacturer's optimal quality decision. Although product decisions do not normally belong to the domain of channel management, they become a relevant issue because the level of product quality can affect the consumer's uncertainty in product evaluations. A manufacturer may provide a higher quality by offering a better AI processor in a phone or an extended flying range of a drone. The higher quality will raise expected consumer valuations on the one hand, and amplify consumer uncertainty and the incentive for deliberation on the other hand. We find that consumers' deliberation costs can move the equilibrium product quality below the socially optimal level. A higher product quality, by encouraging consumer deliberation, can improve the retailer's power and reduce the manufacturer's share of channel profit. Such quality distortion is less severe when the deliberation cost is higher.
Our research builds on the existing literature on deliberation cost. Shugan (1980) provides the first systematic discussion of the necessity of incorporating the deliberation cost into marketing models. However, formal studies of how the deliberation cost can affect strategic marketing decisions have appeared only recently. Wathieu and Bertini (2007) propose and examine the first model of consumer deliberation. They show that the seller may price strategically, using either transgressive pricing to induce or regressive pricing to inhibit consumer deliberations. The analysis and results at the retail level in this paper are very similar to theirs. Guo and Zhang (2012) extend the study to the context of product line design. They find that when the deliberation cost is small, the firm might maintain a minimum quality gap between its different products

to induce deliberation; in contrast, when the deliberation cost is high, the firm might reduce the quality of a product to inhibit deliberation. Xiong and Chen (2013) study a similar product line design problem with deliberation cost, with an assumption that consumers must pay an upfront fee to obtain the products. Recent research in this area has also investigated the relationship between the deliberation decision and some well-discussed consumer behaviors such as the anchoring effect (Guo and Hong 2013) and compromise effect (Guo 2016). The paper is also closely related to the work of Liu and Xiao (2014), who study the competition between store brand and national brand in the presence of consumer deliberation. Besides some differences in modeling setup that are critical to our results, our paper studies equilibrium consumer empowerment and endogenous quality decisions not considered by Liu and Xiao (2014).
Advance selling is another context where firms market their products or services to consumers facing valuation uncertainty (Shugan and Xie 2000, Xie and Shugan 2001). Whereas consumer uncertainty is resolved naturally over time in advance selling, in the present paper, the valuation uncertainty is resolved immediately if and only if a consumer incurs a deliberation cost. Although these contexts are conceptually different, firms face a common decision: whether selling to the entire market before the uncertainty is resolved or selling to the high-valuation segment only after the uncertainty is resolved. One would then expect some similar results in these two contexts. For example, among many results, research has shown that the advance selling strategy is more profitable (than optimal spot selling) when the firm's unit cost is sufficiently low. Although the issue of cost is not explicitly discussed by Wathieu and Bertini (2007), intuitively one would expect that, given all others the same, a firm should be more likely to adopt the regressive pricing strategy when the unit cost is low. However, the conceptual differences in these two contexts lead to very different research focuses. The literature on deliberation cost, including the present paper, focuses on the insights related to the size of deliberation cost. Specifically, the core results of Wathieu and Bertini (2007) are the seller's retail pricing and consumer empowerment decisions for different levels of deliberation costs. Similarly, our paper studies the effect of deliberation cost on wholesale prices and how channel members may manage the deliberation behavior through consumer empowerment and quality decisions.
This paper contributes to the large body of literature on distribution channel management. The issue of double marginalization and its effect on channel efficiency in a decentralized channel has been widely discussed (e.g., Spengler 1950, Jeuland and Shugan 1983,

Tirole 1988). Standard marketing decisions often need to be distorted when examined in a decentralized channel. For instance, Villas-Boas (1998) shows that the manufacturer needs to distort the product line design in a decentralized channel. The quality of the low-end product should be significantly distorted downward. Bhargava (2012) investigates the performance of product bundling in a channel and finds that the retailer is less likely to offer a bundle of products when the manufacturer posts a sufficiently high wholesale price. Liu and Zhang (2006) examine the effectiveness of personalized pricing in a channel and show that personalized pricing can be detrimental to a retailer. Research has also investigated quality disclosure decisions by the manufacturer and the retailer (e.g., Guo 2009, Guo and Iyer 2010, Sun 2015). For instance, Guo and Iyer (2010) demonstrate that the manufacturer may refrain from acquiring perfect consumer information, even if it would cost nothing to do so. In the same spirit, we extend the literature by examining the impact of deliberation cost on channel management. Our results show that the channel members may prefer different levels of consumer deliberation efforts.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We start with the main model in Section 2, where the manufacturer manages the channel through the wholesale price. In this section, we discuss the effect of deliberation cost on the equilibrium wholesale and retail prices as well as the effect on the value of vertical integration. We then extend the model to discuss two alternative ways the manufacturer can directly manage deliberation behavior: reducing deliberation cost through consumer empowerment (Section 3) and managing product uncertainty through quality decision (Section 4). Then, in Section 5, we examine the robustness of our main results when we consider a positive production cost, when the market consists of consumers with heterogeneous deliberation costs, when the deliberation effort is continuous, and when a channel has an extra layer of intermediary. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.
2. Consumer Deliberation and Channel Management: Main Model and Analysis
In this section, we present the main model and analysis. We consider a decentralized channel where a manufacturer manages the channel relationship with a retailer through the wholesale price. The performance of such a channel typically suffers from the double marginalization problem. We study how consumer deliberation cost may affect the equilibrium wholesale price and moderate the channel coordination problem. We will also discuss how consumer deliberation cost can change the benefit of vertical integration as a mechanism to achieve channel coordination.

2.1. Model Setup
Consider a market where a manufacturer distributes a new product to consumers through a retailer. The retailer buys the product from the manufacturer at a wholesale price w and resells the product to consumers at a retail price p. Such a linear wholesale contract has been widely observed in practice and is commonly adopted in the distribution channel literature (e.g., Desai and Srinivasan 1995, Bajari and Tadelis 2001, Iyer and Villas-Boas 2003, Cui et al. 2007). We assume that the unit production cost is zero. We will later relax this assumption and consider a positive production cost in Section 5.1 to better understand the boundary conditions.
Our model of consumer deliberation and purchase decisions closely follows the models of Wathieu and Bertini (2007) and Guo and Zhang (2012). The imitation allows us to build on the extant literature and focus on the implications of consumer deliberations for channel management. Following Wathieu and Bertini (2007), we assume that the product is new to the entire market. As a result, all consumers face uncertain valuations for the benefit of the product. A consumer i's prior valuation of the new product (denoted by vi) follows a uniform distribution over [0, 1]. This prior valuation may reflect the consumer's first impression of the product. The manufacturer and the retailer have the same knowledge about this prior distribution, often obtained through their market research. But the consumers can completely resolve the uncertainty about their valuations for the new product through deliberations. In other words, consumer learning from deliberation is perfect. (We relax this assumption in Section 5.3.) The valuation can vary among consumers because of different personal preferences. In the assumed model, the realized value will be a random draw from [0, 1] with equal probability, thereby reflecting the calibration of prior belief. This rational expectation assumption is common in the literature to rule out biased beliefs as the cause of market outcomes (e.g., Guo and Zhang 2012). We assume that the deliberation efforts are costly for the consumers. The deliberation cost, denoted by c > 0, reflects the cognitive effort invested in the evaluation process. Neither firm (the manufacturer or the retailer) has the means to assess the valuation (vi) of individual consumers beyond its probability distribution. Thus, ex post, after consumer deliberation, the firms and consumers will experience information asymmetry regarding individual consumers' product valuations. Both the deliberation cost c and the valuation distribution are common knowledge in the market. Table 1 summarizes the notations.
The market consists of a unit mass of consumers. Each consumer chooses between buying one unit of this product and receiving an outside option. Value of

Wathieu and Bertini (2007) and Guo and Zhang (2012),

we assume that without deliberation, consumers have

homogeneous product valuations. In this case, a rep-

resentative consumer buys the product if and only if

the expected value exceeds price p. All consumers will

hold the average valuation for the product, which is

equal

to

.

The

implicit

assumption

that

deliberation

increases heterogeneity in consumer valuation follows

Wathieu and Bertini (2007) and Guo and Zhang (2012),

and is consistent with the evidence from consumer

psychology research that these two papers discussed

fairly extensively (e.g., Tesser et al. 1995). If the con-

sumer chooses to deliberate, then he or she will make

more accurate purchase decisions. More specifically,

a consumer makes a purchase if and only if the real-

ized valuation is greater than price p. When deciding

whether to deliberate, a consumer is faced with the

trade-off between making an informed decision and

incurring the deliberation cost. To break ties, we as-

sume that when a consumer is indifferent about buying

or not, he or she always makes a purchase.

All parties are risk neutral and make their decisions to

maximize their own expected payoffs. The sequence of

the game is as follows. First, the manufacturer chooses

the wholesale price w. After observing the wholesale

price, the retailer decides on the retail price p. Finally,

after observing the retail price p, consumers decide

whether to deliberate and, depending on that decision,

whether to buy.

2.2. Model Analysis
We now analyze the main model to investigate the effect of deliberation cost on channel management. We adopt the standard backward induction approach, starting with consumer decisions, followed by the retailer's price decision, and then the manufacturer's decision on the wholesale price. After describing the equilibrium results,

we will discuss the effect of deliberation cost on channel

relations. Throughout this paper, we have achieved

closed-form solutions for all the main results, and our

results are based on the analysis of pure strategy equi-

librium only. We will also use Pareto dominance criteria

to eliminate dominated pure strategy equilibrium. More

specifically, if two different wholesale prices lead to the

same profit for the manufacturer but different profits for

the retailer, we will eliminate the dominated equilib-

rium and retain only the dominant equilibrium. Addi-

tional analysis and all the proofs can be found in the

appendix.

Before we discuss the results, it is useful to note

the results in a benchmark model where consumers

know their own valuations even without deliberation.

(Alternatively, one may interpret this as a model with

zero deliberation cost for all consumers.) In this bench-

mark model, the retail demand is a linear function of the

retail price: D ( p) 1 - p. Such a linear demand function

is common in the channel literature (e.g., McGuire and

Staelin 1983, Moorthy 1988). With double marginali-

zation, the equilibrium wholesale price is w

the equilibrium retail price is p

2.2.1. Consumer Deliberation and Purchase Decisions.

When consumers arrive at the market, they all ob-

serve the product with a common prior valuation and

retail price p. First they decide whether to deliberate.

If consumer i deliberates, he or she makes a purchase

if and only if the realized private valuation is vi  p.

Thus, the expected payoff from deliberation is E(vi - p)+ -

if a consumer chooses not to deliberate, he or she

relies on his or her prior belief to make purchase de-

cision. Because all the consumers share the same prior

belief and hold the same expected valuation, which is

equal to 12, they will all make the same purchase decision. As a result, each consumer's expected payoff

is (Evi - p)+

Following

the

same

logic,

all

consumers should make the same decision about de-

liberation: either they all deliberate or none of them

deliberate. By comparing the expected gains in payoff

from deliberation or no deliberation, we obtain the

following lemma.

Lemma 1. When c  18, (i) if p 2c, consumers purchase without deliberation; (ii) if 2c < p  1 - 2c, consumers deliberate; they

purchase when their private valuation is no lower than p; (iii) if p > 1 - 2c, consumers neither deliberate nor

purchase.

When c > 18, consumers purchases if and only if p

Lemma 1 shows that a consumer's deliberation decision depends on retail price and deliberation cost.

Figure 1. Consumer Deliberation Behavior vs. Retail Price

(See Figure 1 for a graphic illustration.) These results

are essentially the same as those of Wathieu and

Bertini (2007). Briefly, consumers deliberate if the

deliberation cost is low enough and the retail price

falls in a middle range. The intuitive explanation for

the result is that deliberation is beneficial to con-

sumers only if the deliberation is likely to change

their purchase decisions. When the price is very low

(or high), consumers are very likely (or unlikely) to

purchase. In both cases, the deliberation is unlikely to

change the purchase decisions, and therefore the

benefit of deliberation is lower than the cost of de-

liberation. Wathieu and Bertini (2007, p. 121) refer to this

scenario as a "no-brainer" with purchase (or no pur-

chase). Deliberation is more beneficial and likely to

occur when the price falls in the middle range, which

Wathieu and Bertini (2007) refer to as the "thought-

provoking price range." Wathieu and Bertini (2007)

provide empirical evidence to validate that midrange

prices are indeed more thought provoking and induce

additional deliberations, whereas low or high prices

can lead to no-brainer responses of purchasing or not

purchasing.

In the case of a sufficiently high deliberation cost, c > 18, consumers will never deliberate and will simply base

their purchase decisions on prior beliefs and expected

valuations. In this case, any reasonable retail price cannot

induce consumer deliberation. Because a manufacturer's

wholesale price can influence consumer deliberation only

through the retail price, in this case, the manufacturer

cannot induce consumer deliberation either. Thus, this

case of very high deliberation cost is unlikely to generate

any interesting insights for channel management. In the

rest of this paper, we will focus on the case where c  18.

2.2.2. Retail Price Decision. We now analyze the retailer's price decision when c  18. Given the wholesale price w, the retailer chooses retail price p to maximize its profit. According to Lemma 1, the retail price can affect consumer deliberation as a stimulus to think in addition to affecting purchase decisions as an incentive. Retail price has the usual and monotonic impact on the consumer's incentive to purchase. But the effect of price as a stimulus to think is not monotonic: a low price (below 2c) inhibits thinking, raising the price to the middle range induces thinking, but a further increase (above 1 - 2c) inhibits thinking again.
When setting the retail price, the retailer considers both options of inducing and inhibiting consumer deliberation. In the appendix, we first analyze retail pricing and profits in these two distinct scenarios separately, and then derive the retailer's optimal response, which maximizes its profit. We present the results in Proposition 1 and include the details of analysis in the appendix.

Proposition 1. The retailer's optimal response to wholesale

price w is as follows:

1+2w, and total

We illustrate Proposition 1 in Figure 2. The propo-

sition focuses on the areas where wholesale price w is sufficiently low (below 1 - 2c). When the wholesale price w is above 1 - 2c (as in the top region of

Figure 2), the retail price will be forced to exceed 1 - 2c, and then consumers will neither deliberate nor

purchase according to Lemma 1. This corresponds to

the no-brainer no purchase scenario where both the

manufacturer and retailer receive zero sales and profit,

a clearly suboptimal outcome. After excluding this

scenario, the retailer limits its attention to the trade-

off between the thought-provoking and no-brainer

purchase scenarios.

approach leads to the no-brainer purchase scenario,

giving the retailer a low retail margin but a high sales

volume. The second approach leads to the thought-

provoking scenario, giving the retailer a higher margin

but a lower sales volume. Proposition 1 states that

the retailer's choice between these two options depends

on the wholesale price w. When the wholesale price is

low, the retailer is more likely to prefer the no-brainer

purchase scenario and price low to inhibit deliberation.

Otherwise, the retailer prefers to charge a middle-level

the retail price at p 1 - 2c, the upper bound to

maintain a thought-provoking price and ensure positive

sales and profit. As the deliberation cost c increases, this

upper bound price decreases.

In summary, in the presence of deliberation cost, a

retailer may not follow the standard double marginal-

ization practice for two possible reasons. First, when the

wholesale price is low and deliberation cost is high, the

retailer may set a lower retail price to induce no-brainer

purchases. Second, when the wholesale price is high, the

retailer may limit its retail margin to maintain its price

thought provoking. These two types of retail responses

have spirits similar to those of regressive pricing and

2.2.3. Optimal Wholesale Price Decision. We now move upstream to analyze the manufacturer's decision about its wholesale price. The manufacturer correctly anticipates how its wholesale price will directly affect the retailer's price decision and hence indirectly affect the consumers' deliberation and purchase decisions. Specifically, the manufacturer chooses a wholesale price for a desired retailer response, which can be regressive pricing, normal pricing, or transgressive pricing, as indicated by Proposition 1. A formal analysis of the manufacturer's problem leads to the optimal wholesale price summarized in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 shows three regions of deliberation

cost c, each region corresponding to one unique type

of optimal channel strategy. Under the small, interme-

diate, and large deliberation costs, the manufacturer

chooses wholesale prices that result in the retailer

responding with normal pricing, transgressive pricing,

and regressive pricing, respectively.

When the deliberation cost is small, consumers de-

liberate and know their private valuations. The equi-

librium results are identical to those of the benchmark

case without deliberation cost. Given the wholesale

When the deliberation cost is of an intermediate

value, both the equilibrium wholesale and retail prices are equal to 1 - 2c. This is the highest thought-provoking

price. As shown in Figure 2, within this range of de-

liberation cost, depending on the wholesale price, the

retailer may follow regressive, normal, or transgressive

pricing. For the regressive pricing tooccur, the wholesale price has to be as low as w  2 4 2c - 1, which in-

creases with the deliberation cost. Thus, charging a low

wholesale price to induce regressive pricing is not optimal. When the wholesale price is above 1 - 2 2c, the

retailer will prefer to charge the transgressive price 1 - 2c over normal pricing to ensure positive sales. Inter-

estingly, because the transgressive price is not responsive

to the wholesale price, it is optimal for the manufacturer

to charge a wholesale price at the same level (or slightly

below it) for maximum profit. In the equilibrium, the

retailer makes nearly zero profit. This equilibrium result

demonstrates a dramatic effect of the deliberation cost on

channel relations: the retailer's aversion to the no-brainer

no purchase scenario and the adoption of transgressive

pricing minimizes its share of channel profit. Moreover,

within the intermediate range of deliberation cost, as the

deliberation cost increases, both the wholesale and retail

prices go down, and sales go up.

W hen the deliberation cost is relatively high (above

7-3 4

5), the optimal wholesale price is w

1-2c2c, and the

retail price is 2c. The retailer follows the regressive

pricing, which leads to the no-brainer purchase sce-

nario. Here, both the manufacturer and the retailer

enjoy positive profit margins. As the deliberation cost is relatively high, the regressive retail price 2c is high

enough to support enough wholesale margin for the

manufacturer. The manufacturer has to set a wholesale

price low enough and offer the retailer a reasonable

profit margin to induce the regressive retail pricing.

Otherwise, the retailer will choose the transgressive

pricing for a higher profit margin. The resulting con-

sumer

surplus

is

1 2

-

2c > 0.

We illustrate the above results in Figure 3, where

solid lines represent retail prices and dashed lines

represent wholesale prices. In Region II, these two

lines completely overlap, and thus the manufacturer

captures the entire channel profit. Note that in Region I

(low deliberation cost), just like in the case of no de-

liberation cost, the wholesale and retail margins

are both constant and independent of the size of the

deliberation cost. However, in Region II (moderate de-

liberation cost), the prices decrease with deliberation cost.

Then, in Region III (relatively high deliberation cost), the

prices increase with deliberation cost, but the retail

margin decreases with deliberation cost.

2.3. Effect of Deliberation Cost on Channel Management and Value of Vertical Integration
So far we have examined equilibrium results for a decentralized channel with consumer deliberation cost. The results show that as long as the deliberation cost is not too small, the equilibrium wholesale and retail prices are altered by the deliberation cost. The retailer manages the price not only as an incentive to purchase, but also as a stimulus to think: regressive

pricing for a high deliberation cost and transgressive pricing for an intermediate deliberation cost. The manufacturer then incorporates this retailer response when setting the optimal wholesale prices. These results indicate that deliberation cost leads to new and different challenges in channel management. In examining the effect of deliberation cost, we have used the classical channel model without (or with negligibly small) consumer deliberation cost as the natural benchmark. In these models, the manufacturer has the wholesale price as the only mechanism to manage channel coordination. The channel suffers from the standard double marginalization problem, leading to an above-channel-optimal retail price (34) and below-channel-optimal sales (14). With a medium to high deliberation cost, channel performance also depends on consumers' deliberation behavior. Our analysis shows that the manufacturer is no longer concerned with the conventional double marginalization problem. Instead, the manufacturer uses the wholesale price to affect the retailer's choice between a regressive and a transgressive pricing approach.
To more accurately assess the effect of deliberation cost on channel coordination, we need to compare our results to those for a vertically integrated channel with consumer deliberation cost. (Detailed analysis on vertical integration is in the online appendix.) The manufacturer owns the retail operation and sets the retail price to maximize the channel profit. In this vertically integrated model, when the channel system induces consumer deliberation, the optimization problem is maxp(1 - p)p, subject to the constraint 2c < p  1 -
2c as given in Lemma 1. Alternatively, when the channel system inhibits consumer deliberation, then the optimization problem becomes maxpp, subject to

178

 the constraint p  min 12, 2c . We solve these two optimization problems and compare the resulting profits. The results are summarized in Lemma 2.

Lemma 2. With deliberation cost c, in a vertically integrated channel, the retail price is given as follows:

hibits consumer deliberation. The lower price (i.e., p 2c < 12) leads consumers to the no-brainer purchase
scenario. Comparing the results in Proposition 2 and
Lemma 2, we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 1. When the deliberation cost is high enough that

in

the

channel,

the

retail price (p 1 - 2c) is transgressive and higher than

the regressive price a vertically integrated retailer would

charge.

We omit the case of a small deliberation cost because it is essentially the same as the standard model without deliberation cost. In this case, the retailer's response to the wholesale price is linear, and the manufacturer may improve channel efficiency through vertical integration to eliminate the double marginalization problem. When the deliberation cost is not too trivial, the retailer no longer responds to the wholesale price linearly. Depending on the level of wholesale price, the retailer chooses a transgressive and thought-provoking approach or a regressive and no-brainer pricing approach. Within our model, a vertically integrated retailer will always follow a regressive pricing approach and serve the entire market with a low price. In contrast, a decentralized retailer will charge a regressive price when the deliberation cost is large but a transgressive price when the deliberation cost is in a middle range. Thus, a decentralized channel no longer loses channel efficiency when the deliberation cost is high. However, when the deliberation cost is in the intermediate range, vertical integration remains beneficial in improving channel efficiency, but for a reason very different from double marginalization.
To understand the above results, recall that the regressive pricing uses a low retail price to create the no-brainer purchase scenario. This is the desired outcome for the channel system. Alternatively, the retailer may follow transgressive pricing by setting

 a higher and thought-provoking price 1 - 2c. The

thought-provoking price leads to a higher margin (1 - 2c > 12) but a much lower demand. The retailer prefers regressive pricing if and only if the wholesale

price is sufficiently low so that the retailer can enjoy

a reasonable margin while serving the entire market.

This always works for the case of vertical integration

because the internal transfer price is effectively zero.

However, in a decentralized channel, setting a very low

wholesale price can hurt the manufacturer's profit.

When the deliberation cost is in the intermediate range,

the manufacturer would rather choose a higher whole-

sale price that leads to a transgressive retail price and

lower demand. Thus, the conflicting goals between the

channel members can still fail the channel coordination.

When deliberation cost increases, as shown in Figure 2,

the transgressive price decreases, as a high price is more

likely to lead to a no-brainer no purchase scenario,

whereas the regressive price goes up. As a result, the

regressive pricing can now accommodate a wider range

of wholesale prices and becomes more attractive to the

manufacturer. Therefore, with the increased downward

pressure on the thought-provoking price, a decentralized

channel becomes a channel arrangement as efficient as

the vertically integrated channel. It is important to note


that

when

from

5, the retailer

has the realistic option of choosing transgressive pricing.

The manufacturer has to induce the retailer to choose

regressive pricing by offering a sufficiently low whole-

sale price and a high retail margin. In other words, the

manufacturer can use the wholesale price to achieve

channel coordination when the deliberation cost is suf-

ficiently large.

3. Channel Management with Deliberation
Cost: Consumer Empowerment
Our analysis of the main model in the previous section shows how consumer deliberation cost can affect the manufacturer's channel management. In the main model, the deliberation cost is exogenously determined. In this section, we expand the strategy space of the channel members by allowing both the manufacturer and the retailer to change the deliberation cost through consumer empowerment. The concept of consumer empowerment and its impact on consumer deliberation cost have been discussed by Wathieu et al. (2002) and Wathieu and Bertini (2007). In deliberating the benefit of a new feature, a consumer needs to first simulate usage scenarios and then evaluate the personal relevance of the new feature. The channel members can help consumers develop such experience scenarios and understand the personal relevance. In practice, the retailer can use pointof-purchase promotions such as sampling and product trials, consumer education, in-store advertising, and floor sales teams like the Geek Squad at Best Buy to reduce

179

deliberation costs. The manufacturer may empower the consumers through advertising, a company website, and social media such as YouTube. Shugan (1980) suggests that the cost of thinking should increase with the consumer's perceptual complexity in comparing options, the difference in competing options, and the consumer's confidence in making the comparisons. The channel members empower consumers by reducing some aspects of the thinking costs.
We extend the main model by having the manufacturer and the retailer decide the respective levels of consumer empowerment. Specifically, in the game, the manufacturer makes the empowerment decision together with the wholesale price in the first stage. Afterward, the retailer chooses the retail-level empowerment and price p. To achieve a tractable equilibrium analysis of consumer empowerment, following Wathieu and Bertini (2007), instead of modeling the effort on consumer empowerment, we let each firm choose the target level of consumer deliberation cost. We let cm and cr denote the levels of deliberation cost selected by the manufacturer and the retailer, respectively. Effectively, the manufacturer first reduces the deliberation cost from c to cm, and then the retailer further reduces it from cm to cr. We assume, as do Wathieu and Bertini (2007), that the cost of consumer empowerment efforts is zero to both firms. The literature does not provide any direction for how consumer empowerment efforts of different firms may substitute or complement each other. Our assumed technology is substitutable in the sense that one firm can single-handedly empower the consumers without the input of another firm. This assumption allows us to extend the main model in a simplistic manner to derive an equilibrium level of deliberation cost. Relaxing the assumptions, for instance, by incorporating the firm's cost of empowering consumers, is expected to change the quantitative results but unlikely to alter the qualitative implications. When the consumer empowerment cost is assumed to be zero, the analysis will clearly inform how the interests of the manufacturer and the retailer are misaligned.
Next we first describe the relation between an exogenously determined deliberation cost c and the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, respectively. This relation will help understand the equilibrium level of consumer empowerment. We derive the results from the equilibrium outcome in Proposition 2. We summarize the results in Corollaries 2 and 3.

Corollary 2. The effect of deliberation cost c on the manufacturer's profit is as follows:

m c

.

The corollary shows that the manufacturer's profit

increases with consumer deliberation cost as long as the

deliberation cost is not too small. When the deliberation

cost is small, all consumers always deliberate. Any

additional efforts on consumer empowerment will not

change the prices or profits. Interestingly, when the

consumer deliberation cost is higher, the manufacturer's

profit increases with deliberation cost. In other words,

consumer empowerment will decrease the manufac-

turer's profit. The corollary also shows that the marginal

effect of deliberation cost on the manufacturer's profit

differs between intermediate and high deliberation

costs. This is because they correspond to different

pricing strategies: the channel follows transgressive

pricing when deliberation cost is in the middle range

and regressive pricing when deliberation cost is higher.

First, in the intermediate range of deliberation cost,

both

the

and

retail

prices are the transgressive price equal to 1 - 2c. Note

that 1 - 2c is above the channel coordinating price 12.

Thus, as c increases, the wholesale price goes down

sales

2c increase, and the manufacturer's

profit increases. Second, when deliberation cost is high,

the retail price is regressive and low enough to induce

no-brainer purchases. In this case, as c increases, the

wholesale price goes up and so does the manufacturer's

profit. Therefore, in above two cases, the manufacturer's

profit always increases with deliberation cost, but for

very different reasons.

The next corollary summarizes the effect of de-

liberation cost on the retailer's profit.

Corollary 3. The effect of deliberation cost c on the retailer's profit is stated as follows:

.

The corollary shows that the effect of consumer empowerment on the retailer's profit depends on the manufacturer's channel strategy, too. Interestingly,

when deliberation cost is high (7-34 5 < c < 18), the retailer benefits from consumer empowerment. Recall that in this range of high deliberation cost, the retailer follows a regressive pricing strategy. But the retailer has the option of charging a high transgressive price and selling to high-valuation consumers only. The retailer can enjoy a margin because the manufacturer has to offer a sufficiently low wholesale price to induce the regressive pricing. However, as c increases, the transgressive price 1 - 2c decreases, and then the retailer is forced to accommodate a smaller retail margin.
Summarizing the results of the above two corollaries, we can clearly see that the manufacturer's profit is

180

Thus,

the

level

of

the

de-

liberation cost is different for the channel members. The

results follow directly from the profit functions of the

manufacturer and the retailer, as shown in Figure 4.

On the one hand, the manufacturer prefers a higher

cost of deliberation, with which the manufacturer can

fully exploit the retailer. On the other hand, the re-

tailer's profit is maximized at a medium deliberation

cost, c

7-3 4

5. At this deliberation cost, the retailer has

the option of either pricing high to induce deliberation

or pricing low to inhibit deliberation. The manufac-

turer prefers to inhibit consumer deliberation; how-

ever, to have the retailer collaborate, the manufacturer

has to share a significant part of the profit with the

retailer.

Now we analyze the equilibrium strategies when the

manufacturer and the retailer can empower the con-

sumers. We analyze the problem using backward in-

duction. First, in the second stage, the manufacturer has

reduced deliberation cost to cm and set the wholesale price w. The retailer chooses new deliberation cost cr, and the retailer either induces or inhibits consumer

deliberation. Specifically, the retailer chooses between

the following two different strategies:

(a) Inducing deliberation. Given the new deliberation cost cr, the retailer will not charge above 1 - 2cr, the

highest thought-provoking price. This price upper bound

becomes tighter as cr goes up. Therefore, the retailer's profit is always nonincreasing in cr. As a result, if the

retailer prefers to induce consumer deliberation, the

By comparing the above two strategies, we have the

Given the retailer's optimal response, we can move backward to solve the manufacturer's optimal decision. For ease of exposition, we first summarize the equilibrium results given the manufacturer empowerment decision cm in the following proposition.

Proposition 3. Given manufacturer empowerment decision

cm, the equilibrium behavior is as follows:

(i)

the retailer chooses cr cm and p 12.

Moreover, channel coordination is achieved when

cm.

Proposition 3 suggests that the retailer always enjoys a positive margin (p - w > 0) when it can empower the consumers. The retailer, equipped with the ability to reduce the deliberation cost, now always has the option to fully empower the consumers and charge the standard double marginalization price. In response, when cm is high, the manufacturer induces the retailer to choose regressive pricing by offering a sufficiently low wholesale price and a high retail margin. When cm is in a middle range, the manufacturer chooses a higher wholesale price that leads to a transgressive retail price and lower demand. Clearly, the retailer gains power and earns a bigger share of channel profits. As for the manufacturer's profit, we have the following corollary.

It is evident that from Corollary 4 that the manufacturer's profit is nondecreasing in cm. Therefore, the manufacturer does not have any incentive to reduce the deliberation cost from c, and the results characterized by Proposition 3 with cm c are the full equilibrium outcome. Unlike Wathieu and Bertini (2007), in our results, the full consumer empowerment is often not optimal for the channel members. However, as we show in Section 5.1, the manufacturer's empowerment decision changes when the variable production cost is much higher.

4. Channel Management with Deliberation
Cost: Optimal Quality Decision
The main model assumes an exogenous product quality to focus on channel management through prices. In this section, we let the manufacturer decide both the product quality and the wholesale price. A higher quality typically amplifies consumer uncertainty. Thus, whereas in the previous extension we let firms manage the value of deliberation cost c through consumer empowerment, in this section we allow the manufacturer to manage the size of uncertainty through quality decisions. We will examine how the deliberation cost may affect the manufacturer's quality decision and how the manufacturer may use quality and price jointly in managing a channel with consumer deliberation. How would such a quality consideration alter the channel coordination we investigated in the main model?
To examine these issues, we extend the main model to incorporate the manufacturer's quality decision. Here, we define the quality in the vertical sense (Moorthy 1984). First, we assume that the manufacturer chooses from a closed interval [0, 1] of feasible product qualities. The upper bound, q^ 1, represents the limit to the manufacturer's production technology. The manufacturer can choose to produce the full-quality product q q^ or an inferior product at any point of the interval. Second, at the point of purchase, consumers know the quality (e.g., the power of the AI chipset used for a smartphone or the maximum transmission distance for a drone) but are not certain about their marginal valuation for the quality. We assume that consumers' true valuations, measured by their marginal willingness to pay for quality, are heterogeneous. Specifically, for a quality level q, the product valuation Vi iq, where i, consumer i's marginal willingness to pay for quality, is uniformly distributed over the unit interval. The multiplicative formulation is standard in the literature of vertical differentiation (Moorthy 1984, Guo and Zhang 2012,

Hu et al. 2015). Specifically, a "higher segment"--a segment with a larger i--is willing to pay more for any increment in product quality.3 The main model is thus a special case where the quality is fixed at q 1. Third, as in the main model, a consumer does not know but can find out the true value of  at a deliberation cost c. Finally, to focus on the strategic effect of the deliberation cost on the manufacturer's quality decision, we let the marginal production cost for quality be zero. We want to show that even in the absence of concern for production cost, the manufacturer may not choose the highest quality because of the deliberation cost. Later in this section, we will discuss the results under a commonly assumed positive and quadratic production cost function.4
The following proposition establishes the manufacturer's equilibrium quality decision.

Proposition when c  118,

1;

The above proposition shows that the manufac-

turer's equilibrium quality decision depends on the

value of deliberation cost c. The manufacturer produces

at full quality when c is sufficiently small; otherwise,

the manufacturer chooses an inferior product quality.

As

c

decreases

from

1 8

to

118,

the

equilibrium

quality

goes down from q^ to 49, which is less than half of the full

quality. This result is surprising because producing

a higher quality can increase a consumer's willingness to

pay without incurring any additional production cost.

How does the deliberation cost make the manufacturer

want to forgo the costless full quality and the con-

sumers' greater willingness to pay?

A careful examination of the results indicates that the

manufacturer may prefer a lower quality to induce the

retailer to follow the regressive pricing strategy. With

quality q, consumers' deliberation decision no longer

depends solely on the deliberation cost c as in the main

model. Instead, the deliberation decision now depends

on the magnitude of the quality-adjusted deliberation

cost (c/q): a consumer is more likely to deliberate when

quality is higher and hence the uncertainty is larger.

Thus, given the deliberation cost c, with a lower quality,

the retailer is more likely to pursue regressive pricing

for the no-brainer purchase scenario. In contrast, with

a higher quality, the retailer is more likely to pursue

transgressive pricing for the thought-provoking sce-

nario. Proposition 4 shows that when c is not too small,

the equilibrium quality-adjusted deliberation cost is

is

If the manufacturer selects a quality q  q, the retailer still follows the regressive pricing and sells to the entire market. The equilibrium wholesale and retail prices are

improves, the quality-adjusted deliberation cost (c/q)

decreases, and the retailer has a greater power. As we

have discussed in detail earlier, the retailer gains power

as the transgressive pricing becomes more attractive.

Surprisingly, when the manufacturer increases its

quality within this range, it is the retailer but not the

manufacturer that gains power in channel coordi-

nation and benefits from the increased consumer

valuation.

When

the

of full quality. In this case, the deliberation cost is very

small, and consumers deliberate in the equilibrium.

Setting a much lower quality q to induce the retailer to

set the regressive pricing is no longer attractive to the

manufacturer. Given that the retail price will be thought

provoking, it is then optimal for the manufacturer to

produce products of full quality to increase consumer

valuations.

4.1. Cost of Quality

The discussions above about product quality assume

away the consideration of quality costs. We now let

the variable production cost for quality q be a com-

monly

assumed

quadratic

function

analyze

the

manufacturer's decisions again and obtain the following

result.

Figure 5 shows that incorporating the cost of quality does not alter the relation between the optimal product quality and consumer deliberation cost. Specifically, the manufacturer's optimal quality level remains high and constant for sufficiently large or small values of deliberation cost, but it increases with deliberation cost within the intermediate range of c. The pattern of results and underlying reasons are similar to those in Proposition 4. When c is very small, the manufacturer induces deliberation and serves only the high-valuation consumers, and thus a high quality is beneficial. There exists an intermediate range of deliberation cost where the product quality increases with c for the same reason discussed after Proposition 4.

5. Robustness and Model Extensions
In this section, we relax some of the assumptions of the main model to examine the robustness of our results and deepen the insights. First, we examine whether the effects of consumer deliberations may depend on a production cost. Second, we introduce consumer heterogeneity in deliberation cost. We relax the assumption that all consumers are faced with the same deliberation cost by letting a small fraction of consumers have zero deliberation cost. Third, we consider continuous deliberation effort instead of a binary deliberation decision (either deliberate or not) assumed in the main model. Finally, we extend the simple manufacturer­ retailer distribution channel structure by adding a distributor to the system. We analyze how these alternative model specifications may alter the effects of deliberation cost in channel management.

5.1. Production Cost and Effect of

Consumer Deliberations

Here we assume that the manufacturer incurs a vari-

able cost s > 0. The production cost does not affect

consumer decisions or the retailer's best response

functions, which are given by Lemma 1 and Proposition 1,

respectively. However, the manufacturer may de-

termine the wholesale price w according to the pro-

duction cost. We focus on the interesting case where s

Moreover, cs1 is decreasing in s, and cs2 is increasing in s.

Proposition 6 indicates that the key insights from the main model can be readily extended to the setting with a positive production cost. Although most results remain unaffected, we find that as s goes up,the manufacturer is more likely to price at w 1 - 2c, eliminating the profit margin of the retailer. This is because Region II gives the manufacturer a higher profit margin (1 - 2c - s) than its profit margins in Region I (1+2 s - s 1-2 s) and Region III (1-2c2c - s). When production cost increases, profit margin becomes more important than sales, and Region II becomes more profitable. Relatively speaking, the manufacturer enjoys more flexibility than the retailer in response to cost changes.
A noteworthy implication of the production cost is on the manufacturer's incentive to empower consumers. All else being equal, when the production cost is sufficiently large and hence the manufacturer's profit margin is sufficiently low, the manufacturer will prefer a lower deliberation cost. Otherwise, if consumers do not deliberate because of a high deliberation cost, the highest price the manufacturer can charge is w 12, and the profit marginal will be minimal when s approaches 12. As a result, the manufacturer will prefer to reduce the deliberation cost and sell to high-valuation consumers only.

5.2. Consumer Heterogeneity in Deliberation Cost
The main model assumes that all consumers have the same positive deliberation cost c. We now extend the main model and assume that a fraction   (0, 1) of the expert consumers have zero deliberation cost. These expert consumers will always deliberate and know their private valuations. The remaining ¯ 1 -  of the consumers are regular consumers who, as assumed in the main model, have to incur a deliberation cost c > 0 to determine their true valuations. We further assume that the distribution of product valuations is uniform within the interval [0, 1] for both expert and regular

consumers. We limit our analysis to the situations where  is sufficiently small so that the firms will not focus on expert consumers only.
Proposition 7 summarizes the equilibrium channel strategy in this model.

as defined in the online appendix such that there are four

different regions of deliberation costs, each region corre-

sponding to a unique equilibrium channel outcome. The four

regions and the equilibrium outcome in each region are

presented in Table 3.

The results stated in Proposition 7 show that the main insights about the effect of deliberation cost obtained from the main model can be generalized to the model with heterogeneous deliberation costs. As is consistent with the main model, when the deliberation cost is small (in Region I), the equilibrium retail strategy is normal and follows double marginalization. In this region, all consumers deliberate. When the deliberation cost is of an intermediate value (in Region II), the equilibrium retail strategy is transgressive. The retailer charges the upper bound of thought-provoking prices, and all consumers deliberate. Finally, when the deliberation cost is large (in Regions IIIa and IIIb), the equilibrium retail strategy is regressive. The retail price is low and leads to no-brainer purchases for consumers with positive deliberation costs.
With the introduction of consumer heterogeneity in deliberation cost, we now have a segment of expert consumers who always deliberate. This gives the retailer a new option of serving expert consumers only. As a result, Proposition 7 extends Proposition 2 in two areas. First, Table 3 shows that the manufacturer can no longer capture the entire channel profit through the transgressive pricing in Region II. In the equilibrium w < p in all regions. For any wholesale price w < 1 that the manufacturer offers, the retailer can always make a profit by adding a margin over w and selling the product to expert consumers. The manufacturer then has to leave a profit to the retailer to satisfy the incentive compatibility condition. Second, in Region III, as in the main model, the regressive retail price is 2c, which inhibits consumer deliberation. However, with consumer heterogeneity, this region is now divided into two

subregions: IIIa and IIIb. With expert consumers, the

retailer can consider one of the following twooptions: (a) set the transgressive price at p 1 - 2c to in-

duce deliberation and serve both expert and regular

consumers;



(b) price high at p

2c and serve high-

valuation expert consumers only.

The second option is new to this model owing to the

presence of expert consumers. Either of these options can

be more profitable depending on the values of c and . As

the manufacturer anticipates the additional option avail-

able to the retailer, the optimal wholesale price strategy becomes more refined with consumer heterogeneity.5

5.3. Continuous Deliberation Effort

The main model assumes that consumer deliberation

is a binary decision: a consumer either deliberates

with cost c or not at all. In this section, we follow Guo

(2016) and allow the consumers' deliberation effort to

be continuous. Specifically, let  denote the level of

deliberation effort (e.g., the time spent on reflecting

over preferences). As a result of deliberation, there are

two possible states regarding the consumer's ex post

knowledge about his or her valuation vi: either maintaining the prior belief or becoming fully informed of vi. Conditional on , the consumer can resolve the valu-

ation uncertainty with probability (), and the consumer

remains uninformed of vi with probability 1 - (), where () is a continuous function of the deliberation effort.6

To keep the model tractable, we assume that



()

Note that (0) 0, (+) 1, ( · )  0, ( · )  0. Thus, the probability of resolving uncertainty is increasing in deliberation, with decreasing marginal returns to deliberation effort.7 The marginal cost of deliberation is ce > 0.
As in Guo (2016), we model a two-stage sequential decision process for the consumers. The first stage involves deciding on how much costly deliberation to invest to resolve the uncertainty over vi. Next, in the second stage of the decision process, conditional on whether the consumer has resolved his or her valuation uncertainty in the first stage, he or she chooses the alternative with the highest (expected) utility.

5.3.1. Consumer Deliberation Decision. We first consider the consumer's decision-making process. Given retail price p, the consumer first chooses , the level of deliberation, and incurs the deliberation cost ce · . Then vi is revealed with probability (). Conditional on the deliberation outcome, the consumer
makes the purchase decision. The purchase decision
is such that if uncertainty is resolved, the consumer

makes purchase if and only if vi  p; otherwise, the

consumer purchases if and only if E[vi]

p.

Hence,

the consumer's expected surplus, given precision , is

CS ()E[vi - p]+ + (1 - ())(E[vi] - p)+ - ce · ,

and the consumer chooses  that maximizes CS. Solving the consumer's first-stage decision, we obtain the following lemma.

5.3.2. Equilibrium Channel Strategies. Because of the high degree of the profit functions, the problem is analytically intractable.

5.3.3. Implications of Deliberation Costs on Firms'

Profits. In Figure 7 we plot the manufacturer's and

the retailer's equilibrium profits at different deliberation

costs ce. The shapes of the profit functions are similar to those of the main model. Like what we find in the main

model, the manufacturer's profit is maximized when ce is at the upper bound, whereas the retailer's profit is

maximized at a moderate deliberation cost ce 18. Again, when deliberation cost is very large, consumers do not

deliberate, and their value uncertainties are unresolved,

with E(v) 12. In this case, the manufacturer charges a

whether the effect of consumer deliberation cost on channel management remains in such a multilevel channel. A possible complication in this model is the extra layer of marginalization, that is, the triple marginalization problem.
Our analysis of the three-level channel with consumer deliberation cost leads to the following proposition.
Proposition 9. The equilibrium channel strategies in a three-level channel are as presented in Table 4.
As in the main model, the equilibrium result depends on the cost of deliberation. Specifically, in Proposition 9, the entire parameter space is divided into three regions corresponding to normal pricing, transgressive pricing, and regressive pricing. First, in Region I, with a very small deliberation cost, consumers always deliberate, and we observe a case of triple marginalization. Second, in the middle range of deliberation cost, each channel member sets the price equal to the transgressive pricing, the highest thought-provoking price. In this case, the manufacturer as the channel leader takes the entire channel profit. Finally, in Region III, the retailer sets the regressive pricing and every consumer buys without deliberation. In the equilibrium, every channel member earns a positive profit. Overall the qualitative insights are identical to those in the main model. A notable distinction is that Region II covers a wider range of parameter values; in other words, the transgressive pricing is more likely to be the equilibrium outcome. Intuitively, with an extra middleman joining the channel, the manufacturer's profit is further reduced in Regions I (normal pricing) and III (regressive pricing), but its profit is not affected in Region II (transgressive pricing). Therefore, transgressive pricing becomes more attractive to the manufacturer.

5.4. Multilevel Distribution Channel
The main model considers a decentralized channel with a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer uses its wholesale price to manage the retailer's response to deliberation cost. We now extend this model to a three-level channel: the manufacturer sells its product to a distributor at the wholesale price w1, then the distributor resells the product to the retailer at the distributor's price w2, and finally the retailer sells the product to end consumers at the retail price p. In practice it is fairly common for manufacturers to employ such a multilayer distribution channel. In addition to making the model more realistic, we want to investigate

for the new product, consumers have to decide whether they want to engage in costly deliberation to learn about their true valuations for the product. According to our analysis, the cost of those deliberations can have substantial effects on the channel members' marketing decisions. First, the deliberation cost can distort the equilibrium wholesale and retail prices. The retailer may use a low price (regressive pricing) to inhibit consumer deliberation or a high price (transgressive pricing) to provoke consumer deliberation. Thus, the retailer uses the price to manage consumer demand and deliberation efforts. In anticipation of this, the manufacturer sets the wholesale price to induce the desired type of retail pricing behavior. Specifically, when the deliberation cost is high, the manufacturer charges a low wholesale price for the regressive retail pricing. When the deliberation cost is intermediate, the manufacturer charges a high wholesale price for the transgressive retail pricing. The standard double marginalization problem exists only when the deliberation cost is very small. These results arise from the manufacturer's strategic use of wholesale price and thus cannot be readily inferred from the insights from the literature of information management and consumer deliberation (e.g., Lewis and Sappington 1994, Bertini and Wathieu 2010).
Second, the manufacturer and retailer can engage in consumer empowerment activities to reduce deliberation cost, but the channel members have misaligned incentives to empower consumers. The manufacturer prefers a high deliberation cost to retain its power to influence the retailer; but such power is limited by the retailer's ability to empower consumers. The retailer can directly influence consumer deliberation, which yields the retailer additional channel power for a greater retail margin. This result would imply that a retailer can be interested in developing point-of-purchase promotion activities for new products and building a knowledgeable sales team like Geek Squad for the purpose of increasing its power within the channel. In contrast, the manufacturer is more interested in consumer communications to generate consumer awareness for new features such as Huawei's AI processor. Finally, the deliberation cost may lead the manufacturer to offer a lower product quality. A higher product quality, for example, a larger flying range for a drone or a more intelligent chip for a phone, could encourage consumer deliberation, improve the retailer's power, and reduce

the manufacturer's share of channel profit. Thus, although a higher quality can increase the mean valuation, the manufacturer may limit the product quality for the benefit of stronger channel power vis-a`-vis the retailer. Such quality distortion, which is not socially efficient, is less severe when the deliberation cost is higher. These extended implications on marketing decisions underscore the importance of investigating consumer deliberation in the context of channel conflict.
We do not view our results as the final word on the channel relations and consumer empowerment in markets with consumer deliberations. Instead, we see our work as a modest extension of existing research on deliberation (e.g., Wathieu and Bertini 2007) and as a contribution to channel literature. Our results may be subject to the assumptions of the model and should be interpreted with care. Below, we discuss some of the important directions in which to extend the assumptions.
First, competition between the manufacturers can affect the equilibrium results. Consider a market with multiple manufacturers selling through the same retailer, for example, major cellular phone brands distributing their products through Best Buy. In this case, if the focal manufacturer offers a unique feature, our model still applies, as consumer evaluation of other brands will serve as the outside option. However, if multiple competing manufacturers offer the same new feature, then the retailer's incentive to empower consumers can change. Such a model extension will also change pricing dynamics and the impact of deliberation cost on product decisions. Second, the form of the wholesale contract will likely change the incentives of channel members to empower consumers. This paper assumes that the manufacturer uses a simple linear wholesale contract. Although such a wholesale contract is prevalent in practice, the manufacturer may offer other forms of wholesale contracts, for example, two-part tariffs commonly adopted in franchise contracts and quantity discounts. The form of wholesale contract can change the variable cost facing the retailer and the channel performance. One could also interpret such differences due to contractual forms as variations across industries. Future research may also explore some of the creative pricing formats considered thought provoking by Bertini and Wathieu (2010). Finally, although this paper employs a static model, the firms' strategy can change when considering long-term implications. In the case of zero variable cost, our analysis indicates that the

187

manufacturer may prefer low empowerment to achieve high market penetration. After the purchase, some consumers will realize low values and experience low satisfaction. In a dynamic model where customer satisfaction can have long-term impacts, the manufacturer should be more likely to empower consumers than the prediction of this paper. Future research may also consider a dynamic model where a manufacturer plans to offer successive generations of new products and consumer deliberation cost changes over time.

Appendix. Proofs of Propositions Proof of Proposition 1 The retailer's response includes two cases: induce deliberation and inhibit deliberation. We first analyze each case separately, getting the optimal solutions, and then combine the two cases together to obtain the globally optimal solution.

Case 1: Induce Deliberation. Given the wholesale price w, when the retailer sets its price to induce deliberation, its pricing problem is
max(1 - p)(p - w),
p

where 1 - p is the demand and p - w is the retail margin. The problem is subject to

(IC1) (IR1)

Here the incentive-compatible condition (IC1) requires that a consumer expects a higher value from deliberating over not deliberating, and the individual rationality condition (IR1) requires a nonnegative consumer surplus from deliberation. By combining conditions (IC1) and (IR1), we obtain a thoughtprovoking retail price range 2c  p  1 - 2c. Analysis of the above optimization problem yields the following lemma.

Lemma A.1.

Otherwise, the retailer does not sell the product.

Lemma A.1 indicates two distinctive cases of thought-

provoking retail pricing approaches. Recall that a thought-

provoking retail price is below 1 - 2c. When the wholesale

thought-provoking retail price is the outcome of standard

double marginalization, that is, p 1+2w. However, when the

wholesale price is high and the outcome of double margin-

alization

1+w 2



1

-

2c, the optimal thought-provoking retail

price is equal to p 1 - 2c, the upper bound for consumer

deliberation. In this case, the retail price no longer directly

responds to the wholesale price, and the retail margin decreases as the wholesale price approaches p 1 - 2c from

below. Thus, to maintain a thought-provoking price to ensure

positive sales and profit, the retailer has to sacrifice its retail

margin. Moreover, as the deliberation cost c increases, the upper bound for thought-provoking prices p 1 - 2c de-

creases, and therefore the retail margin is more likely to be

squeezed to maintain consumer deliberation.

Case 2: Inhibit Deliberation. Now we consider the case where the retailer sets the price to inhibit deliberation. The retailer's optimization problem becomes
max p - w,
p

where the demand is 1 and p - w is the retail margin. The problem is subject to the following constraints:

Lemma A.2. Suppose that the retail price inhibits consumer deliberation. Given wholesale price w, when w  2c, the optimal retail price is p 2c, resulting in sales S 1 and a profit r 2c - w. Otherwise, the retailer does not sell the product.

Lemmas A.1 and A.2 show the results under two retailing strategies leading to different levels of stimulus for consumer thinking. Whether to induce or inhibit consumer deliberation has significant implications for the retailer's expected profit.

Retailer's Optimal Response. With Lemmas A.1 and A.2,

we can solve the retailer's optimization problem; that is, the

retailer chooses between the optimal deliberation inducing

strategy and the optimal deliberation inhibiting strategy.

hence,

is always induced.

The proof follows immediately. 

Proof of Proposition 2

Case 1: Inducing Deliberation. Consider first the case of

inducingdeliberation. Suppose that the manufacturer prices at

w  1 - 2c; the retailer is

pth(ewn,) folmloiwnin1g-Le2mcm, 1a+2wA..1R,etchaell

optimal price for that if the retailer

prices above 1- 2c, the individual rationality constraint is

violated and consumers neither deliberate nor make purchases.

When w  1 - 2 2c, the retailer prices at p

and the manufacturer's profit is 1  (1 - p)w (1-2w)w, which

is maximized when w

w  1 - 2c, the retailer prices at p 1 - 2c, and the man-

ufacturer's profit is 2 (1 - p)w 2cw, which is maxi-

mized when w 1 - 2c. Hence, when deliberation is induced,

the optimal wholesale lowing three values: w

price canonly  {12, 1 - 2c, 1

take value from the fol- 2 2c}. Let us consider

these three values:

(i) When w

1 2

,

themanufacturer's

profit

is

1

1 8

.

(ii)When w 1 - 2c, the manufacturer's profit is

2 2c(1 - 2c ).





(iii) When w 1 - 2 2c, the manufacturer's profit is 2c(1-

2 2c ) < 2; hence, this can never be the optimal solution.

By comparing 1 and 2, we have the manufacturer's optimal

strategy when inducing deliberation:

(i)

When

c



3-2 16

2,

the

manufacturer's

prices

at

w

its profit is 1  18.

(ii) 

When

<

c

<

1 8

,

the manufacturer's





prices

at

w

1-

2c, and its profit is 2 2c(1 - 2c ).

Case 2: Inhibiting Deliberation. When c is above c2, a threshold that will be defined later, the manufacturer
wishes to inhibit deliberation. For this case, the retail price should be p 2c, as derived in Lemma A.2. The retailer may

and may not inhibit deliberation. If it induces deliberation, the optimal retail price is p min 1+2w, 1 - 2c .
Hence, to motive the retailer to price low enough, the fol-

lowing incentive compatibility constraint must be imposed:

 2c - w

Solving this inequality, we have the manufacturer's optimal

strategy when inhibiting deliberation:

(i) When c 7-34 5, w 4 2c - 1, and the manufacturer's

profit is 3

2 4 2c - 1;


(ii)

When

1-2c2c, and the manufacturer's

Finally, by comparing the profit under the two cases (in-

ducing and inhibiting deliberation), we can derive the

equilibrium strategies. 

Proof of Lemma 3

Suppose prices at

and the induces

prices at p 12, and inhibits deliberation. The profit under the

former

strategy

is

(1-w)2 4

and

the

profit

under

the

latter

strategy

is

1 2

The

break-even

wholesale

price

is

thus

w 2 - 1, and the results follow.

Suppose prices at p

and

the

profit

under

the

latter

strategy is 2cm - w. The break-even wholesale price is thus

w 2 4 2cm - 1, and the results follow. 

Proof of Proposition 3

When

Similar

to

Proposition

2,

we can derive the equilibrium channel strategy, as shown in

Table A.1.

We can see that the equilibrium channel strategies are

very similar to those in the basic model (see Proposition 2),

where

replaces the role of c. Now let us consider the following

cases:

we

have

the

following

four

subcases:

falls in Region I, and the manufacturer's profit is m which is maximized when q 1, yielding a profit m 18.

Region IV, and the manufacturer's profit is m 2q, which is maximized when q 8c, yielding a profit m 4c.

By comparing the four regions together, we find that the

optimal quality level is q 1.

(iii) Case 2.3. q  [0, 8c]. The relative deliberation cost falls

By comparing the three regions together, we find that the

subcases:

(ii) Case 3.2. q  [0, 8c]. The relative deliberation cost falls

and always falls into Region IV. The manufacturer's profit is

then m 2q, leading to the optimal quality q 1. The proposition follows immediately. 

Proof of Proposition 5

As in the proof for the previous proposition, we consider four

different cases. We start with the case where c is small. The

results follow from standard marginalization, where the re-

tailer

the

demand

man-

ufacturer's profit is

which is maximized when q 23, w 49; the corresponding profit is m 217.
For the second case (Region II, w p q - 2cq), the manu-

facturer induces deliberation and takes entire channel profit.

Its profit is

m

For the third case (Region III, w 2cq ), the manufac-

The maximum is achieved when q

The proposition follows by comparing the profit functions

For more information on the Kirin 970, see the company's press release https:// consumer.huawei.com/en/press/news/2017/ifa2017-kirin970/. 3 The results can be sensitive to this assumption and may change if consumers' valuations are not proportional to product quality. 4 The quality decision in this model can be equivalently interpreted as quantity, that is, the decision on package size. All analyses and results in this section hold with this alternative interpretation. 5 Extending the analysis of this model to decisions on consumer empowerment and optimal quality is analytically not tractable. We conduct numerical analyses and provide some results in the online appendix. Overall, in this model of heterogeneous deliberation cost, we can validate the result that the retailer may prefer a moderate level of deliberation cost while the manufacturer prefers a high deliberation cost. We can also validate the result that the manufacturer may prefer a moderate level of quality even though a higher quality does not entail any additional cost. 6 As noted by Guo (2016, footnote 6), it is not a necessary assumption that the consumer's valuation uncertainty can be completely resolved by deliberation. In cases where residual uncertainty may persist, vi can be redefined as the expectation of the (true) preference parameter, conditional on the information gained through deliberation. 7leNadumtoesriimcaillasrimreuslualttiso,nfosrsuexgagmesptlteh,at(an) ummbaexr(o3fo,t1h)earnspdec(ific)atio1+ns.
