This paper describes the use of a marketing science model by Jetstar, a subsidiary of Australia's leading airline, Qantas, to effectively and profitably compete in the low-cost carrier marketplace. We trace the evolution of the Jetstar strategy from a baseline calibration of its initial position, to its efforts to attain price competitiveness and service parity, followed by its highly focused, cost-effective service delivery strategy. We develop a hierarchical model with parameters estimated at the individual level. This allows us to study not only how service design and pricing initiatives shift the perceived performance of Jetstar relative to its competitors but also how the airline can move market preferences toward areas in which it has competitive advantage. The contribution of the research is substantial. The Jetstar market share went from 14.0% to 18.1% during the first five quarterly waves of the research, and profits went from $79 million in 2006­2007, before the study was commissioned, to $124 million in 2008­2009.

1. Introduction
Jetstar was established in May 2004 as a budget airline by Qantas, Australia's foremost domestic and international carrier. Its purpose is to cover the low-cost segment of the market, which began around 2000 with the launch of a competitor, Virgin Blue. Until the time Jetstar began operations, Virgin Blue had been successfully eroding the Qantas market share by attacking it from below as a no-frills provider. In response, Jetstar was also designed to be a no-frills carrier, predominantly targeted at the leisure market (Ritson 2009).
Jetstar initially achieved some success in this role, reaching a market share of 14% by the beginning of 2008. However, market research results suggested that Jetstar was not generally perceived as competitive in value to Virgin Blue, either in terms of the perceptions of price competitiveness or the quality of its service. Based on this research, Jetstar embarked

on a three-stage strategy. First, it addressed unfavorable customer perceptions of price and quality by using price promotions and advertising communications about service levels. Second, Jetstar changed beliefs about quality through a service enhancement program and a more focused quality-based advertising message. The third stage was one of consolidation, to take advantage of the momentum generated by the second stage. The analysis described here had a major impact on the actions taken by Jetstar management. Today, Jetstar remains the only successful low-cost offshoot of a full service airline in terms of shareholder returns.
2. The Management Problem
By the end of 2007, perceptions about Jetstar's lack of price competitiveness were inconsistent with its actual fares in the market. Surprisingly, Jetstar was perceived as more expensive than was Virgin Blue,

even though the actual airfares were nearly identical. This limited the effectiveness of Jetstar as a fighter brand and retarded its financial results. To avoid the financial stress (and ultimate demise) suffered by every low-cost brand of other major carriers, such as British Airways' Go, United's TED, and Delta's Song, Jetstar saw a need to improve consumer perceptions. To this end, Jetstar needed new pricing formats, adaptive service design changes, and effective communications. To design such services, Jetstar management required information on the drivers of evaluation and choice, where Jetstar stood relative to its competitors on these, how drivers and perceptions varied across the population, and the relation of service design features to perceptual drivers.
2.1. The Strategic Approach Jetstar recognized that its management actions would likely evolve over a period of time in response to market feedback. Consequently, the Jetstar requirements were to understand the market on a continuous basis to first assess customer needs, then develop a strategy to address these needs, and then subsequently monitor to judge whether the strategy had been successful. These strategies were expected to be adapted and refined over time in response to changes in perceptions and needs. This dynamic modeling approach enables us to study the interaction of marketing activity and market analysis in a way that is impossible with the comparative statics commonly used in marketing science applications. To implement this evolutionary approach, Forethought Research first undertook pilot qualitative research, followed by quarterly quantitative studies.1
3. Model
To meet the management demands described in §2, our model is developed with a number of requirements in mind. These include the need to (i) simultaneously accommodate a hierarchy of process attributes, (ii) develop a choice model of consumer preferences to enable translation of service performance improvements to share and profit, (iii) capture heterogeneity across the population, and (iv) represent how beliefs and preferences change over time. Simultaneously handling these four requirements is rather challenging and has not previously been attempted in the service quality literature.

3.1. Conceptual Model

One of the more powerful and robust conceptual

models for service industries links value to price

and quality (Sweeney et al. 1999) because perceived

value is repeatedly demonstrated to correlate well

with market share and profits (Zhou et al. 2009). This

thinking forms the basis of the widely used Cus-

tomer Value Analysis model developed largely by

Gale (1994). In Gale's model, the key dependent vari-

able is customer perceived value, which is determined

by price and quality. These constructs, in turn, are

linked to process attributes. In a departure from this

standard service quality model, we posit that relative

perceived value forms the basis for consumer choice

among alternative suppliers. That is, utility is gauged

by the relative perceived value of an airline, and this

utility is the key element in a choice model.

Although many customer satisfaction/service qual-

ity studies operate at a "global level" in that they

attempt to associate value with quality and price (e.g.,

Sweeney et al. 1999), firms also need to know how

to improve their overall value by improving their

performance at a more microprocess level (Rust and

Zahorik 1993). Figure 1 depicts a conceptual model

of the global attributes and microprocess attributes

relevant to this airline environment and the links

between these attributes. Notice that, in our case, ini-

tial qualitative research found that consumers con-

sider operational performance and reputation to be

the key components of airline quality, and this is

incorporated into the third level of Figure 1. As

mentioned earlier, Jetstar management expected cus-

tomer perceptions and needs to change over time in

response to their pricing, communications, and ser-

vice process activity. These dynamics are illustrated

in Figure 1 for the model parameters that are reesti-

mated for each survey wave (e.g.,

Price it

.2

Previous researchers have handled these two

demands of gauging the importance of global and

micro attributes with a sequence of two regression

models, one at the global level, followed by a series

of models at the micro levels (see, e.g., Danaher

and Mattsson 1994) or by using a LISREL approach

to modeling multidimensional, hierarchical constructs

(e.g., Brady and Cronin 2001). In this study, however,

we use a Bayesian hierarchical model to conceptu-

ally "integrate" these two requirements (macrolevel

market share evolution with microlevel attribute eval-

uation for service design) into a single model, as

explained below. This approach using our consumer

choice framework is novel to the service quality literature. Our method also captures individual-level heterogeneity, an important factor that is often ignored in service management (Danaher 1998).

3.2. Hierarchical Model for the Consumer Decision Process
We employ a hierarchical Bayes model to capture differences in consumer tastes as well as variations in their perceptions. Consistent with our conceptual model, we develop a model consisting of two interrelated layers. The first, or top, layer is a multinomial logit model for consumer choice of the probability that respondent i chooses airline j:

Pij yij

i=

exp yij i j exp yij i

(1)

for i = 1 n respondents and j ranging over the
consideration set of airlines about which a respondent is aware.3 At this top layer, the variables yij

are respondent ratings for each airline on the "global attributes" of Performance, Reputation, and Price. Therefore, i is a three-dimensional vector, with components ik being the importance weight that individual i places on global attribute k (k = 1 is Operational Performance, k = 2 is Reputation, and k = 3 is Price Competitiveness). That is,

yij

i = airline_dummies +

Perf i

Perfij

Price i

(2)

In keeping with our conceptual model in Figure 1, we construct a second layer in which the global attributes are, in turn, functions of a set of relevant microprocess subattributes as follows:

yijk xijk ijk k  N xijk ijk k

(3)

Specifically, we write the linear model as

Lk
yijk = 0 + airline_dummies + iklxijkl + ijk (4)
l=1
Here, xijk is a vector containing individual i's evaluation of airline j for each of the Lk subattributes

corresponding to global attribute k, and it is appropriately defined to accommodate the intercept and airline dummy variables. The dimension of this vector depends on the number of relevant subattributes. For instance, the subattributes for Performance include "good route structure," "easy check-in," and "easy to reach airport." The complete list of subattributes is given in Figure 1; there are 12, 10, and 7 subattributes for Performance, Reputation, and Price, respectively.4 The ikl parameters are importance weights placed on each subattribute corresponding to individual i, global attribute k, and subattribute l.5

Hence, our model captures unobserved heterogeneity in respondent preferences through the distributions around i and ik, as defined in Equations (5) and (6).

3.3. Sample and Questionnaire Design Domestic leisure travelers departing from Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane in Australia form the target market for the study. Respondents are selected so as to be demographically representative of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland residents in accordance with the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics census data.6 Demographic stratification by age, gender, state, and metro/rural ensures representativeness of the sample. An online survey was designed and

Although the flavor of the results and the management implications that flow from them are not altered by this change, any competitive insight that could be obtained from observing the real subattribute names and values is removed.
5 As for the top-level importance weights, we initially had ik also varying by airline, but the empirical results did not show significant variation across airlines.

pilot tested by Forethought Research. We report on the first five quarterly survey waves, with the first quarter being January to March 2008.
Each of the five quantitative waves reported here consisted of between 1,600 and 2,000 respondents (see Table 1 for exact numbers), selected using stratified random sampling. Respondents were recruited from a large online panel of 160,000 people to complete a Web-based survey lasting approximately 20 minutes. Only about a quarter of these panelists were eligible, given the criteria of having flown on a domestic leisure flight in the past year.
There are five airlines operating in this market: Jetstar, Qantas, Rex (Regional Express), Tiger Airways (owned by Singapore Airlines), and Virgin Blue. Ideally, we would get interviewees to evaluate all five airlines, but this lengthens the survey considerably, thereby increasing respondent fatigue. To alleviate this problem, respondents are queried about just two airlines. These airlines represent a random selection from those that respondents have flown in the past year and also those that they have not flown, but about which they feel they have sufficient familiarity to evaluate. Further details about the questionnaire are included in Appendix A of the electronic companion to this paper, available as part of the online version that can be found at http://mktsci .pubs.informs.org/.

3.4. Estimation

The likelihood equation for discrete choice models is

of the form

L=

P Zij ij

(7)

ij

where zij = 1 if the jth item was chosen by respondent i and 0 otherwise. The conversion of scale for
the Value variable to a discrete choice analogue was
achieved via the following transformation: zij = 1 if vij > vij and zij = 0 if vij < vij , where vij is the score given to the worth-what-paid (i.e., value) question by
respondent i for airline j and vij is the value score for the other airline evaluated. In the case of ties between
vij and vij , one airline was chosen at random with a probability of one-half.

As the maximum likelihood equation for Equation (7) involves estimating high dimensional integrals, we used a Gibbs sampler to estimate the unobserved heterogeneity as well as estimate the other random effects in the model in a fully Bayesian context. We present the full technical details in Appendix B of the electronic companion.
4. Implementation and Results
Although the research is ongoing, we describe the first five quarterly waves of the market research, which correspond to the first three major stages of the strategy. Prior to this research, the strategy that Jetstar adopted was entitled "everyday low prices." The three stages of migration described here are referred to internally at Jetstar as "low fares--good times," "focused service delivery," and "consolidation." The first wave of market research established a baseline of perceptions, preferences, and behavior against which to track changes as a result of management actions over these three stages. The relation between these three stages of implementation and the five waves of monitoring is detailed in Table C.1 in Appendix C of the electronic companion.
4.1. Initial Position (Wave 1): January 2008 At the time of the baseline calibration (Wave 1), Jetstar was almost exclusively using a "low price" message in its communications, but the points of proof to make this credible were not evident to consumers. The first task of Wave 1 was to establish just how far behind Jetstar was on price and quality perceptions.7 Figure 2 shows that at the beginning of the new strategic initiative, Jetstar had a 6.9% perceived price disadvantage to Virgin Blue (7.05 versus 7.57, respectively, on a 10point scale).8 Although this may not sound a lot, it is quite important in the price-aware end of the market. The Jetstar overall quality disadvantage can be seen from Figure 3 to be even greater, at 22.3% (6.02 versus 7.75). This invites a naïve interpretation--namely, that Jetstar should focus on quality because it lags behind Virgin by a much greater amount on quality than it does on price. However, our model reveals that what is more important to customers is price. Additionally, because price is a search attribute and quality an experience attribute, Jetstar management considered the response function of price would be more sensitive to management activity than that of quality in the short term (Wright and Lynch 1995).
Table 1 shows that price is the most important global attribute, with an estimated coefficient of 4.464.
7 Quality is a combination of perceived operational performance and perceived reputation and is measured separately in the survey instrument (refer to Figure 1).
8 For proprietary reasons, we cannot display the results for Qantas.

This is followed by operational performance (3.392)

and then reputation (2.973). Table C.2 in Appendix C

of the electronic companion expresses these global

attributes in terms of the constituent subattributes

that drive them, showing management where the

most traction can be gained with improved pric-

ing and service design. For example, in Wave 1, the

importance of perceived on-time performance is crit-

ical in the determination of overall operational per-

formance perceptions, having the largest estimated

coefficient of 0.214. Furthermore, everyday low fares

(0.252), cheap fares (0.280), and good deals (0.209) are

the primary drivers of price competitiveness.

We can also make use of the heterogeneity compo-

nent of our model to understand further the extent

to which there is individual-level variation in the

importance weights for the key global attributes of

operational performance and price. Such an analy-

sis is not possible with a simple regression model.

First, there is greater variation in the

effects, which range between -1 and 1, whereas

weights than does performance. Second, the relation-

negative,

with a regression line fitted to these observations

showing that price random effects are about twice

those of performance. Indeed, those persons that

place high importance on price place low importance

on performance, and vice versa. That is, for price-

sensitive customers, it is harder to compensate for

poorly perceived prices with improved performance

because of their lower-quality coefficients. Although

a price/quality trade-off is generally expected, Fig-

ure 4 enables us to gauge the strength of this trade-off,

which very much favors price in this case.

4.2. First Stage of Intervention: Addressing Price Perceptions and the Quality Gap
The first intervention required Jetstar to gain at least a perception of price parity with a significant part of the target market, given that attribute's importance in the domestic leisure market. Additionally, given the price elasticities from the detailed models, management changed the theme of Jetstar communications and advertising to focus on a price guarantee that promised that Jetstar would offer a 10% price reward to any customer that found "a lower fare online on

the same route for a comparable time" (see Figure C.1 in Appendix C of the electronic companion).
4.3. Monitoring the Results (Wave 2): April 2008 The price perception of Jetstar relative to Virgin Blue improved dramatically as a result of the Stage 1 initiatives (see Figure 2). From a 6.9% deficit in March 2008, price perceptions of Jetstar changed markedly to a 2.5% deficit in only three months (7.42 versus 7.62). By March 2009 (Wave 5 of the quarterly tracking), Jetstar was within 1.3% of price parity overall and well ahead of Virgin on the key pricing subattributes it was targeting.
Service quality improvements also had a substantial effect on consumer perceptions. The overall quality gap was narrowed from 22.3% to 17.9% (6.5 versus 7.9 in Figure 3). Given the difficulty of communicating two messages to the marketplace simultaneously (price and quality), management was reasonably happy with this result.
4.4. Second Stage of Intervention: A Focus on Cost-Effective Service Quality
With the achievement of perceived price parity for a large percentage of the population, Jetstar addressed its perceived deficit in quality. Jetstar tackled that gap by focusing on a few specific subattributes that had high importance and offered good opportunity on which to achieve a point of difference over Virgin Blue at low cost. For proprietary reasons, we cannot disclose the exact subattributes chosen by Jetstar. However, for illustration purposes, Table C.2 of the electronic companion shows that if the subattributes with the highest importance weights for

Operational Performance are selected in Wave 2, then Jetstar should focus on on-time performance and having attentive and helpful staff (assuming equal cost of provision).
4.5. Monitoring the Results (Wave 3): July 2008 The price perception of Jetstar relative to Virgin Blue continued to improve. From a 6.9% deficit in March 2008, perceptions of price competitiveness for Jetstar changed markedly to a 3.3% deficit in only six months (7.4 versus 7.6 in Figure 2). Over this time period, the improvement in service quality for Jetstar was also considerable. On average, by Wave 3 in Q3 2008, some 31% of the perceived service quality disadvantage for Jetstar was overcome (see Figure 3, where the difference declines from 22.3% to 15.5%), with particularly strong results for Jetstar's key target attributes.
4.6. Third Stage of Intervention: Consolidation Given the success of its Stage 2 strategy of maintaining price comparability and moving to focused differentiation (see Figures 2 and 3), Jetstar saw no need to dramatically alter its marketing activity. Because of lags in consumer belief updating, Jetstar could still gain further advantage by continuing its current message and service improvement from the second stage.
4.7. Monitoring the Results (Waves 4 and 5): October 2008 and January 2009
In Wave 4, Jetstar maintained its price perceptions, whereas Virgin Blue lost ground. By the end of the period covered by this study, Jetstar had closed more than 80% of the price competiveness perception gap

(see the last quarter scores in Figure 2). With respect to quality, the average gap had narrowed by 45% (see Figure 3, where a 22.3% deficit in Wave 1 had been reduced to a 12.2% deficit in Wave 5).
Given that Jetstar, and also Virgin, evolved from a low-price strategy to one of good quality at a low price, it is interesting to see if this trend in price/quality trade-off is reflected in the consumer heterogeneity of tastes. Figure 5 plots the price and performance random effects in Wave 5, thereby updating the Wave 1 situation in Figure 4. Here, we see dispersion in performance importances on a much more equal footing to those of price. The slope of the regression line has declined substantially, from -1.85 in Wave 1 to -0.56 in Wave 5. This is evidence that the market has changed in terms of its preferences even in this 15-month period. No doubt the heavy Jetstar advertising, combined with its tangible service quality improvements over this time period, contributed to these revised customer preferences.
5. Assessing the Benefits
Benefits from the strategy, and the marketing measurement and modeling associated with it, accrued at a number of levels. We discuss them under the headings of operational, strategic, and financial benefits.
5.1. Operational Benefits One of the main operational benefits was that Jetstar was able to greatly improve on its forecasting performance, using the combination of consumer-level and market-level techniques. The correlation between the

model's share predictions for Jetstar and the actual share realized is very high, at 0.92. In an industry with an enormous cost of excess capacity in terms of planes, crew, and ancillary facilities, the resultant better forecasts had huge direct cost savings.
Additionally, largely as a result of a service improvement program, a major cultural transformation was undertaken. This migrated the organization from being efficient, safe, responsible, and consistent to one with a stronger customer service orientation. The quality drive was supported by the CEO, who visited every Jetstar port to emphasize the expected behaviors. All employees received a DVD pack outlining "who we are" and "what we expect" and were told that their performance would be judged against the company values. Managers were provided with a decision support system to enable them to determine appropriate areas of focus. To cement the behavioral change, Jetstar redefined its key performance indicators (KPIs), with 40% of executives' bonuses linked to the market research levels for the quality drivers chosen by Jetstar.
5.2. Strategic Benefits One effect of the share gains of Jetstar was to put pressure on the Virgin Blue economic model, and in February 2009, Virgin announced that it would start reducing capacity.10 It was not the objective of Jetstar to damage Virgin Blue, but one measure of the reduced degrees of freedom Virgin suffered over the period can be seen from its profit, which went from $279 million in 2006­2007 to a loss of $183 million in 2008­2009.
In addition to providing strong flanking defense to Qantas from the attack by Virgin Blue, Jetstar also provided a growth vehicle for Qantas. The brand has been launched in Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, and New Zealand, and all locations are now highly profitable. Transportability of the method to other organizations, industries, and management problems is discussed in more detail in Appendix D of the electronic companion (with examples of several applications).

5.3. Financial Benefits The Jetstar revenue and profit contribution increased dramatically during the period of the study and remains on a strong upward trajectory, as shown in Table 2. One of the business imperatives of the Qantas parent was that Jetstar be financially profitable in its own right. By focusing in areas directed by the research and designing a migration path to its vision, Jetstar has reached the stage where in the first half of 2009 it provided more than 100% of the Qantas group's profits.
Jetstar ascribes $35 million of its improved profit performance to initiatives associated with the study. David May, marketing director, suggests that each share point is worth $86 million. The share gain of 4.1% represents an additional $86 million × 4 1 = $353 million per annum. A conservative estimate has 10% of this revenue flowing directly to the bottom line, yielding $35 million of contribution per year. If the decay rate of those share gains is 20% and the discount rate is 15%, then the net present value of the increased share is $116 million.
5.4. Prognosis As illustrated in Table 3, the market share for Jetstar has increased by 29% (4.1 share points, unweighted by availability) in the first 12 months of this research/strategy initiative. If we examine Figures 2 and 3, we can see that Virgin has maintained its strong position on the price/quality combination, being Gale's (1994) "value for money." This has made it a formidable competitor. By contrast, Jetstar was initially in a poor position, with perceived mediocre price competiveness and low quality. However, by Wave 5, Jetstar was in a position almost comparable to Virgin in the eyes of a large proportion of the target market. Moreover, Jetstar has improved its perceptual position while growing its profit, whereas Virgin Blue

6. Summary
The research described in this paper tackles an important management problem: the marketing actions needed to migrate customer beliefs in a cost-effective way. As opposed to comparative statics, we need a series of actions over time with feedback between each stage to enable the adaptive management of marketing activities toward the long-term vision. For a flanker brand such as Jetstar, we need to account for consumer differences and dynamics, both of beliefs and tastes. Future research could examine possible strategic responses by Jetstar's competitors, using the model's capability for adaptive response.
We meet the Jetstar management needs by marrying a multilevel choice model with unobserved heterogeneity and dynamics. In the case of Jetstar, the potential benefits from this approach have been realized by the commitment of top management to its results and the engagement of staff to the implementation of its recommendations through their KPIs and reward structures.
