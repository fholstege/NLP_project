Asymmetric pricing or asymmetric price adjustment is the phenomenon where prices rise more readily than they fall. We offer and provide empirical support for a new theory of asymmetric pricing in wholesale prices. Wholesale prices may adjust asymmetrically in the small but symmetrically in the large, when retailers face cost of price adjustment. Such retailers will not adjust prices for small changes in their costs. Manufacturers then see a region of inelastic demand where small wholesale price changes do not translate into commensurate retail price changes. The implication is asymmetric--a small wholesale price increase is more profitable because manufacturers will not lose customers from higher retail prices; yet, a small decrease is less profitable, because it will not lower retail prices; hence, there is no extra revenue from greater sales. For larger changes, this asymmetry in the behavior of wholesale price vanishes as the price adjustment cost is compensated by the increase in retailers' revenue resulting from correspondingly large retail price changes. We present a formal economic model of a channel with forward-looking retailers and cost of price adjustment, test the derived propositions on the behavior of manufacturer prices using a large supermarket scanner data set, and find that the results are consistent with the predictions of our theory. We then discuss the implications for asymmetric pricing, channels, and cost of price adjustment literatures, as well as public policy.

1. Introduction
Asymmetric pricing or what is also known as asymmetric price adjustment is a phenomenon where prices rise readily but fall slowly. Frequent reports in the popular press lament the fact that prices are asymmetric. It is not uncommon to read headlines about prices "rising like rockets (but) falling like feathers" (Octane Week 1999); retail pork prices not coming down even if hog prices do (New York Times 1999); and government subsidies to dairy farmers not lowering dairy products prices, even if a hike in the price of industrial milk paid to farmers, raises such prices at the store (Canadian Press Newswire 2000). The resulting public interest in the phenomenon has spawned a large academic literature devoted to the issue. Asymmetry has been studied across a broad range of product markets (Peltzman 2000), including

gasoline (Bacon 1991, Borenstein and Shepard 1996, Karrenbrock 1991); fruit and vegetables (Pick et al. 1991, Ward 1982); pork (Boyde and Brorsen 1988); and banking (Hannan and Berger 1991, Neumark and Sharpe 1992).
Yet, despite the substantial research in asymmetric pricing, the theoretical literature in the area is still in its nascent stages. Peltzman (2000), for example, comments that "Economic theory suggests no pervasive tendency for prices to respond (asymmetrically) " Most existing research is empirically driven, attempting to establish the scale and scope of asymmetry. Only a few papers develop formal theories. These include explanations based on monopoly power (Benabou and Gertner 1993, Borenstein and Shepard 1996), inflation with costs of price adjustment (Ball and Mankiw 1994), elasticity differences

in a channel with costs of price adjustment (Madsen and Yang 1998), and information processing costs of consumers (Chen et al. 2005). Yet, in the context of the broad evidence of asymmetric pricing, the theoretical field is still largely unexplored. For authors like Peltzman (2000), this represents a "serious gap in a fundamental area of economic theory." Similar sentiments are echoed by Ball and Mankiw (1994), Borenstein et al. (1997), and Blinder et al. (1998), all calling for further theory development to close this gap. Surprisingly, given the ubiquity of the phenomenon and the rich marketing literature in pricing (cf. DeSarbo et al. 1987, Hess and Gerstner 1987, Ratchford and Srinivasan 1993, Tellis and Zufryden 1995, Kadiyali et al. 2000), marketing's contribution to research in asymmetric pricing has been marginal till date. To the best of our knowledge, marketing has not directly studied asymmetric pricing.1
In this paper, we hope to address this gap by offering, and providing empirical support for, a theory of asymmetric pricing. Our theory combines insights from the literature on channels of distribution with insights from the literature on costs of price adjustment to suggest why wholesale prices may be asymmetric. This is a natural direction to explore for two very important reasons.
First, we know little about the role played by the distribution channel and the business-to-business linkages implied therein, in determining asymmetric pricing at any level of the channel. Yet, such linkages have been consistently argued to have important influences on the channel's pricing practices.2 There is no reason to believe asymmetric pricing will be an exception. Quite to the contrary, Peltzman (2000) suggests, "an explanation for asymmetry may require a fuller understanding of those vertical market linkages." By focusing on asymmetry in wholesale prices in the context of a distribution channel, we help to clarify the role of such vertical linkages.
Second, while there is a large literature on the importance of costs of price adjustment for price rigidity, we are only beginning to develop our understanding of the implications of these costs on both pricing decisions of other members of the distribution channel and asymmetric pricing.3 For example,
1 The marketing literature on price adjustment costs is limited. See the paper on haggling by Desai and Purohit (2004) as an example of how these costs might impact marketing strategy. On asymmetry, see Greenleaf (1995), Kopalle et al. (1996), etc. for their consideration of asymmetric reference price effects, which is the closest related work.
2 See Jeuland and Shugan (1983), Moorthy (1988), Choi (1991), Messinger and Narasimhan (1995), Ingene and Parry (1995), Bergen et al. (1996), etc.
3 For the literature on these costs, see Mankiw (1985), Ball and Mankiw (1994, 1995), Danziger (1987), Levy et al. (1997), Basu

Levy et al. (1997) attempt to calibrate the source and magnitude of these costs, but do not explore asymmetry or the implications for channel pricing. On the other hand, Ball and Mankiw (1994) combine costs of price adjustment with inflation to offer an explanation of asymmetric pricing. There are also authors who combine channels of distribution and costs of price adjustment. For example, Basu (1995) has addressed both price adjustment costs and channels of distribution in his work on stages of processing, although he focuses on the implications for price rigidity rather than any asymmetry issues in his paper. Madsen and Yang (1998) look at differences in price elasticities in channels of distribution with costs of price adjustment to offer an explanation for asymmetric pricing. We develop this literature to increase our understanding of the implications of costly price adjustment on prices throughout the channel of distribution and asymmetry.
We suggest that retail costs of price adjustment may result in asymmetric pricing by manufacturers. If retailers face costs of price adjustment, they will not adjust retail prices for small changes in wholesale prices. This changes the demand curve faced by the manufacturers. In essence, they then see a region of inelastic demand where small wholesale price changes do not translate into commensurate retail price changes. The implication is asymmetric for manufacturers--it will make small wholesale price increases more profitable because they will not lose customers from higher retail prices. Yet, they will find it less profitable to make small wholesale price decreases, because these will not translate into lower retail prices, and therefore no extra revenue will be generated by these wholesale price cuts.
For larger wholesale price changes, however, retail prices move readily because the cost of changing prices is compensated by increases in retailers' revenue. As a result, wholesale prices adjust symmetrically to large changes. To formalize this idea, we present an economic model with costly price adjustment in a distribution channel where members have rational expectations because they are forward looking, and therefore behave with foresight. In using the model, we derive testable predictions about patterns of wholesale price adjustment.
To test this theory, we need data on upstream prices in a channel, where we believe price adjustment is costly for the retailer. A natural place to look is in the grocery industry, where these costs have been shown to exist (Levy et al. 1997, 1998; Dutta et al. 1999). Specifically, we use the Dominick's Finer Food (DFF) scanner data set because it has a measure of
(1995), Blinder et al. (1998), Dutta et al. (1999), Slade (1998), Zbaracki et al. (2004), etc.

upstream prices that the retailer paid for its products (wholesale prices), and because the existence of retail costs of price adjustment in this industry has been documented in the earlier studies. The data consist of up to 400 weekly observations of this measure of wholesale prices in 29 different product categories, covering the period of about eight years between 1989 and 1997.
We conduct the analysis for each of the 29 categories and find almost uniform support for our theoretical propositions--asymmetry in the small, but symmetry in larger wholesale price changes. To check if our results are because of inflation, we redo each category-level analysis, first for noninflationary, and then for deflationary periods in the data set. In both cases, we find our results to be robust across the categories considered. Yet, one limitation of DFF's data set is that the reported wholesale numbers are not actual wholesale prices but are based on the average acquisition cost. Therefore we also check if the results could be an artifact of the manner in which wholesale prices have been calculated, and conclude that this cannot explain our results.
In the rest of this paper, we first present the model, followed by an account of the data, analysis, and the results. We then discuss the theoretical and managerial implications for the literatures spanning asymmetric pricing, distribution channels, and costs of price adjustment. The implications for public policy are discussed next. We finish this paper by highlighting the principal conclusions, important limitations, and opportunities for future research.
2. Theoretical Model
In this section, we offer a theory where asymmetric pricing at wholesale level is driven by the presence of downstream costs of price adjustment. Thus, at a minimum, we need to consider a two-level distribution channel, with pricing decisions for each member, and downstream costs of price adjustment.
Specifically, we model a channel with one manufacturer selling through one retailer to end customers. The customer demand is a continuously differentiable function, decreasing in p D p , in each period. For feasibility, we assume the demand function is such that there is at least one price above cost at which demand is positive. We let the manufacturer set the wholesale price wi and retailer set the retail price pi in each period i. Both manufacturer and retailer choose prices to maximize their profits. To explore price adjustment from one period to the other, we need to consider at least two periods. We denote the initial pricing period as t0, where channel members set the initial price of the product. The second, or the "adjustment period" is denoted t1. In the adjustment period, firms will decide

whether, and how much, to adjust prices given the costs of price adjustment and any changes in market conditions.
We assume that the retailers must bear a fixed cost x whenever they change retail prices. Thus, in period t1, if the retailer decides to change prices from those they set in the initial period t0, they must incur a cost of x. If the retailer chooses not to adjust prices in period t1, then they do not have to bear this cost.
The manufacturers are also assumed to have a fixed cost y whenever they change wholesale prices. They can avoid this cost in period t1 by not changing their t0 period prices.4
The impetus for price changes comes from changing market conditions. We focus on changes in manufacturers' costs as a proxy for such an impetus.5 More specifically, the manufacturer faces a unit production cost c in the initial period t0, and this cost changes by an amount c in the adjustment period t1. We assume c is a single-peaked symmetric distribution with mean zero.6
In terms of how the channel prices are set in each period, we will assume a Stackelberg game with the manufacturers as price leaders, i.e., they set wholesale prices anticipating the retailers' reactions to these prices. The retailers then take the wholesale prices as given and set retail prices. In setting these prices across periods, we let both the retailer and manufacturer act with foresight, i.e., in period t0, both consider the pricing actions they will take in t1.
In this setup, asymmetric pricing occurs when the likelihood of positive price adjustments are systematically greater than those of negative ones given similar changes in market conditions. For example, given
c = 0 of a given magnitude, asymmetric pricing is exhibited if the likelihood of prices rising following
c > 0 is greater than the likelihood of prices falling following c < 0. Asymmetry is also exhibited if the magnitude of the positive price adjustment is greater than the magnitude of the negative adjustment. For
c = 0, asymmetric pricing would be exhibited if the likelihood of prices rising is greater than the likelihood of prices falling or remaining the same.
In the following paragraphs, we first set up the general problem. We then explore a model of this channel without any costs of price adjustment to illustrate
4 In the analysis, we consider a case with y = 0 for expositional simplicity. The general case with y > 0 is dealt with in the appendix.
5 There are many other ways market conditions can change. These include changing demand, entry or exit of competitors, change in the macroeconomy (inflation or recession), change in government regulation (price or produce control), as well as acts of God (unseasonal weather patterns), etc. The spirit of these results would remain unchanged, regardless of the specific situation.
6 Note that if there are inflationary trends, the expected value of c would be nonzero. So, our results are essentially derived for a zero inflation scenario.

that asymmetric pricing is not a result of the vertical separation in a channel setting per se. Subsequently, we investigate this model with only retail costs of price adjustment x . This illustrates that by itself, costly price adjustment leads to price rigidity but not asymmetry. However, this also allows us to illustrate how these downstream costs of adjustment lead to upstream asymmetry in wholesale prices during the adjustment period. In the appendix, we explore the general model with the manufacturer costs of adjustment y to investigate its effects on our results.

2.1. General Case of Channel with Costs of
Price Adjustment
The retail profit functions in the initial period t0 and in the adjustment period t1 are, respectively,

r0 = Max p0 p0 - w0 D p0

r1 = Max p1

p1 - w1 D p1 - x

(1)

where = 1 if p1 = p0 0 otherwise

Similarly, the manufacturer profit functions are, respectively,

m0 = Max w0 w0 - c D p0

m1 = Max w1

w1 - c - c D p1 - y (2)

where = 1 if w1 = w0 0 otherwise

where wi and pi are the wholesale and retail prices in period i and mi, ri being the corresponding profits.
Both the manufacturer and retailer maximize total
profits over the two periods. We assume that the fea-
sibility conditions of profit maximization are satisfied,
i.e., positive profit-maximizing prices are feasible and
that demand is positive at such prices.
The retailer and the manufacturer must take their
expected t1 period solutions into account in solving for their initial t0 period prices. These t0 prices are then considered when solving for the adjustment t1 period prices. Our solution process, therefore, is to
proceed backward by first solving for the t1 period prices w1 and p1, given the t0 prices p0 and w0. We then derive the equilibrium t0 prices using the t1 period solutions. The equilibrium t1 prices can then be obtained by substituting these t0 solutions.
Additionally, in each period, we solve for the prices
in a Stackelberg fashion where the manufacturer takes
into account the retail reaction function p w in set-
ting its wholesale price. For example, the t0 period solutions are derived in two stages.
First, the retail reaction function p0 w0 is obtained from7

Max p0 p1e

p0 - w0 D p0 + p1e - w1e D p1e

(3)

7 We do not include a discount factor for the second-period profits. Such a factor does not affect our central results, but makes the notations more complex.

where p1e = p0 + pe and w1e = w0 + we, the superscript "e" denoting the prices expected by the retailer
in the adjustment period. Next, this is substituted into
the manufacturer problem to solve

Max w0 w1e w0 - c D p0 w0

+ w1e - c - E c D p1e

(4)

where E c is the expectation of c based on the distributional assumptions made earlier.
Having set up the general problem, we now consider below the implications for asymmetric pricing.

2.2. Channel Pricing Without Costs of Price Adjustment
We begin by exploring the pricing decisions of channel members when there are no costs of price adjustment (x = 0, y = 0).

Adjustment Period t1. With no costs of price adjustment in t1, from (1), is not a factor in the retail problem. Hence the initial period price has no
affect on the adjustment period solutions and we can
directly solve for the equilibrium adjustment period
prices. The retailer sets p to maximize p - w1 · D p , which gives the retailer's price reaction function
p1 w1 that solves

p1 w1 = p w1

s.t. p = w1 1 - 1/ r1

log D where r1 = r1 w1 = - log p (5)

Similarly, from (2), the manufacturer sets w to maximize w - c + c D p1 w . This gives the wholesale price w1, which solves8

c+ c w=
1 - 1/ m1

log D

where

m1 = m1 p1 w

=- log w

(6)

The equilibrium retail price p1 is then given by p1 = p1 w1 .
From (5) and (6), in equilibrium,

w1

=

c+ 1 - 1/

c
 m1

and

p1 =

c+ c

1 - 1/

 r1

1 - 1/

 m1

(7)

Initial Period t0. In the initial period, because there are no costs of price adjustment, neither the manufacturer nor retailer needs to take into account the impact of initial pricing decisions on later adjustment period actions. The maximization problems therefore become identical to that of the adjustment period, except that costs will be c + E c rather than c + c.

8 Subsequently, the superscript "" will be used to denote equilibrium solutions.

135

By our distributional assumption of c, E c = 0. Hence the equilibrium solutions with the appropriate notations are

w0

=

1

-

c 1/

 m0

and

p0 =

1 - 1/

c

 r0

1 - 1/

 m0

(8)

Notice from (7) that both w1 and p1 exhibit a symmetric pricing pattern--both negative and positive cost changes of similar magnitudes elicit the same magnitude of wholesale and retail price changes. Hence the channel per se does not lead to any asymmetric price adjustment.

2.3. Channel Pricing with Downstream Costs of Price Adjustment
Consider now the case when we allow for downstream costs of price adjustment, x in the earlier setup. In the context of the vertical separation of a distribution channel, these costs lead to asymmetric adjustment of prices. For ease of exposition, we keep y = 0 in the following discussion. When x > 0, the price adjustment decision of the retailer changes. In the adjustment period t1, the retailer will not change prices unless market forces change sufficiently to make such price adjustment worthwhile.
Adjustment Period t1. The retailer's objective function in t1, given the initial pricing decision p0 is

r1 = Max p

p - w1 D p - x

where = 1 if p1 = p0 0 otherwise (9)

Here, it incurs a cost x when it changes price = 1 from the t0 period price p0. When it does not change price = 0 , it does not incur this cost.
The solutions are obtained first by solving for = 1 and then for = 0. In the first case, x is a fixed exogenous parameter, and does not affect the firstorder conditions. So, the retailer's desired price in the adjustment period is the same as previously solved in (7). The retailer's solution is a price reaction function p1 w1 that solves

p1 w1 = p w1

s.t. p = w1 1 - 1/ r1

log D where r1 = r1 w1 = - log p (10)

Now, the retailer will implement a new price = 1
only if, by doing so, it is going to be better off than
by staying at p0. Therefore it will not change price = 0 if p1 w1 - w1 D p1 w1 - x  p0 - w1 D p0 .
The retailer's solution therefore is

p1 w1 =

p1 w1 p0

if p1 w1 p0 x otherwise

(11)

where p1 w1 p0 x denotes that the following condition is satisfied:

R p1 w1 - x > R p0 with R p = p - w D p C · therefore denotes complementary condition

R p1 w1 - x  R p0

(12)

To solve the manufacturer problem, recall from (7) that if the retailer reacts to the manufacturer's price change, the optimal wholesale price will be w1 = c + c / 1 - 1/ m1 . But the existence of downstream costs of price adjustment creates a region defined by C · above, where the retailer does not change its own price. Hence demand would be inelastic to any wholesale price change in that region and the manufacturer will not find it optimal to price as in (7). For wholesale price changes where · is satisfied, however, the retailer will change its price and the manufacturer will find it optimal to price as in (7). By taking this into account, the manufacturer's wholesale pricing decision in the adjustment period is

(13)

Since = 0 from (9), the t1 period solutions are a function of the t0 period prices. We therefore first solve for the t1 prices given the t0 prices p0 and w0. Subsequently, the t0 solutions p0 and w0 are derived by incorporating the t1 results. These are substituted back, to get the final t1 solutions p1 and w1. In the following, we discuss these price adjustment decisions.
Retailer Price Adjustment Decision--Rigidity, but Not Asymmetry. Equation (11) implies that there exists a region of small wholesale price changes around zero where retail prices are rigid. To see this, consider the retail solution in (11). Substituting w0 and p0, the C p1 w1 p0 x condition can be written as R p1 w1 - x  R p0 or
p1 w1 - w1 D p1 w1 - x  p0 - w1 D p0
Substituting w1 = w0 + w and rearranging
p1 w1 - w0 D1 - p0 - w0 D0 + D0 - D1 w - x  0
where D0 = D p0 and D1 = D p1 w1 . Now, let K = p1 w1 - w0 D1 - p0 - w0 D0. It must
be the case that K < 0. This is because p0 being the profit-maximizing price; the profit p0 - w0 D0 must be greater than profit determined by any other retail

price. Therefore, rewrite the C · condition as - K +
D0 - D1 w - x  0. For w = 0, the condition is identically satisfied.
For w > 0, by assumptions of a well-behaved profit function, p1 w1 > p0. Consequently, D0 > D1, since the demand function is downward sloping. We can then rewrite the C · condition as - K +
D0 - D1 w - x  0. Clearly, therefore, there exists a wr = K + x / D0 - D1 > 0 such that the C · condition is satisfied only if w  wr . For w < 0, by similar logic as above, p1 w1 < p0 and, consequently, D0 < D1. The C · condition can then be rewritten as - K - D0 - D1 w - x  0. Therefore, there exists a wr = - K +x / D0 -D1 < 0 such that the C · condition is satisfied only if
w  wr . Taken together, the C · condition implies a region
of small wholesale price changes where the retailer
does not change its price. This is given by - wr  w  wr , where

wr =

p1 w1 - w0 D p1 w1 - p0 - w0 D p0 D p0 - D p1 w1

+x (14)

Since the retail reaction function is of the form

p1 w = w0 + w / 1 - 1/ r1 , this region of price rigidity still does not suggest asymmetry. In fact,

when w > wr , the retail price adjustment is symmetric in that both negative and positive w will elicit

matching positive and negative retail price adjust-

ments. If we abstract away from the channel and look

at the price adjustment decisions of the retailer as an

individual economic agent, we are led to conclude

that while it leads to price rigidity, price adjustment cost

per se does not lead to asymmetric pricing. This is a stan-

dard result in the costs of adjustment literature (cf.

Carlton 1986, Danziger 1987, Kashyap 1995, etc.).

Manufacturer Decision--Asymmetry. When the retail solutions are folded back into the manufacturer problem, the region of retail rigidity can now be obtained as - wr  w  wr , where

wr =

p1 - w0 D p1 - p0 - w0 D p0 D p0 - D p1

+x

(15)

Substituting this, the manufacturer solution is

 w1 if w > wr where w1 = w0 + w

w1 = w11

if w  wr where w11 = arg max w - c -
w

c D p0 (16)

Notice in solving for w11, that demand D p0 is unaffected by changes in wholesale costs. Conse-

quently, the maximization problem reduces to one of

maximizing w, which gives w11 = w0 + wr as the solution.

Consider now the nature of the region defined by

w  wr . First, note that w is the wholesale price adjustment that the manufacturer would make

in the absence of any retail costs of price adjust-

ment. Now, if c = 0, we have w = 0, and therefore

w1 = w0. Therefore, since w1 = c +

c

/

1 - 1/

 m1

, we

can write

w =

c/ 1 - 1/

 m1

. Since

1 - 1/

 m1

> 0,

w  wr can now be rewritten in terms of c as

- cr  c  cr

where

cr =

wr

1 - 1/

 m1

(17)

Substituting this, the manufacturer solutions can

now be expressed as

w1

=

 

1

w0 +

wr

if c > cr if - cr  c 

cr

(18)

Consider the implication of the above solution for wholesale prices. For changes in costs that are large, whether positive or negative, i.e., when c >
cr , we have symmetric adjustment because wholesale price changes by commensurate amounts in either directions.
However, for changes in costs that are small, i.e., in the range - cr  c  cr , we have asymmetric adjustment. The asymmetry can be seen from the following: when the cost change is nonnegative 0  c  cr , the wholesale price goes up by the amount wr , but when the cost change is negative - cr  c < 0 , not only does the wholesale price not come down, but it actually increases by the same magnitude. To relate it back to our earlier definitions of asymmetry, given identical magnitudes of small positive and negative cost changes in the range - cr  c  cr , the likelihood of prices rising following c  0 is greater than the likelihood of prices falling following c < 0.
The asymmetry above is driven by the retail costs of price adjustment, x and the concomitant retail rigidity. If the manufacturer knows that the retailer's price adjustment is costly, it will have an incentive to raise wholesale prices, and a disincentive to lower them, in the region of rigidity for the retailers. The incentives that these retail costs of price adjustment create for asymmetric pricing by manufacturers is the heart of our argument in this paper.

Initial Period t0. In the initial period, the retailer's solution would take into account the expected whole-
sale prices in the next period, w1e = w0 + we. In equilibrium, w1e = w0 + wr . The retailer changes price in t1 only if w > wr , otherwise its price remains unchanged. Hence the retailer solves for the price that

will maximize profits over the two periods t0 and t1 as per the following:

r

=

Max p

p - w0 D p w

+ p - w0 - wr D p w

(19)

The solution gives p0, which gives

 r0

where

(20)

The forward-looking retailer therefore compensates

for its cost of adjustment by charging wr / 2 1 -

1/

more in the initial period than what it would

charge if it did not have any such costs.

To derive the manufacturer price w0, we fold the retail solution into the manufacturer problem. Now,

the manufacturer's wholesale prices change in both

directions in t1 only for large enough cost changes
c > cr . For smaller cost changes, however, wholesale prices change only upwards by wr . In fact, this is true even if there is no change in

costs. Since E c = 0, in equilibrium, the manufac-

turer solution must incorporate this upwards adjust-

ment in t1. To set w0, therefore the manufacturer maximizes
over the two periods as

m

Notice that the t0 prices of the manufacturer are

if there were no costs of price changes in the channel.

In the adjustment period, for retail prices, the
solutions imply symmetric adjustment for large cost
changes c > cr , but rigidity when cost changes are small enough - cr  c  cr . For wholesale prices, however, the implications are different. While

for large cost changes, the adjustments are symmetric, for small changes, we now have asymmetry. Retailers take this into account in setting their initial prices and manufacturers take retailers into account in setting the initial wholesale price as well. Thus we have rational expectations for all channel participants.
The above discussions lead to the following research proposition.
Proposition 1. There is a range of cost changes for which the manufacturer will adjust its wholesale prices asymmetrically. In particular, the manufacturer will only adjust its prices upwards regardless of the direction of cost changes, in a region of cost changes of small magnitudes: - cr  c  cr . For cost changes of larger magnitudes, the wholesale prices will adjust symmetrically.
We address the consequences of upstream costs of price adjustment, y in the appendix. These costs imply regions of wholesale price rigidity, but not asymmetry. Our main results are robust to reasonable specifications of y. More specifically, when y is small relative to x y x and does not cause wholesale prices to remain unchanged, the asymmetry results are identical.
3. Empirical Validation
Our general empirical approach is to test the main implications of the model using upstream price data. Typically, however, upstream data are difficult to get. Therefore we first choose a context that broadly satisfies some of the key assumptions of the model and then use the available scanner data that also have upstream prices. Specifically, we use scanner data from a large Midwestern supermarket chain.
3a. Implications of the Model. Our theory predicts that for small cost changes (indirectly observed by small wholesale changes), wholesale prices are more likely to change in the positive direction than in the negative, but for large cost changes (indirectly observed by large wholesale changes), wholesale prices should not exhibit any such systematic pattern. It follows, therefore, that positive wholesale price changes are more likely than negative wholesale price changes when the magnitude of change is small, but they are equally likely when the magnitude of change is large. In other words, wholesale prices will exhibit asymmetry in the small, but not in the large.
Moreover, recall that our results were derived in the absence of inflationary trends. Therefore, this pattern should be independent of inflation. In other words, we expect that the pattern of asymmetry in the small will be observed in noninflationary periods as well.9
9 Note that we abstain from defining what might constitute a "small" price change because its precise magnitude will vary with

The availability of data that cover a long time span enables us to examine this implication by separating the data into inflation-period, low-inflation-period, and deflation-period subsamples.
3b. Data. To examine the empirical validity of the model's implications, we use data from DFF, which is one of the largest retail supermarket chains in the larger Chicago metropolitan area, operating 94 stores with a market share of about 25%. Large multistore U.S. supermarket chains of this type made up about $310,146,666,000 in total annual sales in 1992, which was 86.3% of total retail grocery sales (Supermarket Business 1993). In 1999, the retail grocery sales has reached $435 billion. Thus the chain we study is a representative of a major class of the retail grocery trade. Moreover, DFF's-type multistore supermarket chains' sales constitute about 14% of the total retail sales of about $2,250 billion in the United States. Since retail sales account for about 9.3% of the GDP, our data set is a representative of as much as 1.28% of the GDP, which seems substantial. Thus the market we are studying has a quantitative economic significance as well.
The data consist of up to 400 weekly observations of wholesale prices covering the period from September 14, 1989 to May 8, 1997.10 The length of individual product's price time series, however, varies depending on when the data collection for the specific category began and ended. Note that DFF's UPC-level database does not include all products the chain sells. The database includes 29 different product categories, representing approximately 30% of DFF's revenues (see Table 4).11
DFF sets its prices on a chainwide basis at the corporate headquarters, but there may still be some price variation across the chain's stores, depending on the competitive market structure in and around the location of the individual stores (Levy et al. 2002, Dutta et al. 2002). According to Barsky et al. (2003), DFF, in general, maintains three price zones depending on the local market conditions. For example, if a particular store of the chain is located in the vicinity of a Cub Food store, then the store may be designated a "Cubfighter" and as such, it may pursue a more aggressive
the size of the price adjustment cost as well as with various demand factors. Instead, we focus on what it implies in terms of the observable behavior of the wholesale price by letting the data tell us what may constitute a "small" price change. See the results in the Discussion section.
10 The wholesale prices here are the average acquisition costs (AAC)--see a later section for a discussion.
11 Note that the data for Beer and Cigarettes categories may be problematic. Unlike the others, they are subject to various kinds of tax rules and government regulations such as restrictions on sales and promotional practices. We, nevertheless, present the results for all 29 categories for the sake of completeness.

pricing policy in comparison to the stores located in other zones. In the analysis described below, we have used all the data available from all stores.
The wholesale price data we have is not direct. Rather, they are calculated indirectly, from the retail prices reported in the chain's scanner database, which are the actual retail transaction prices (i.e., the price customers paid at the cash register each week), and the profit margin the supermarket makes on each product. Thus the wholesale price series we use are calculated according to the formula Pw = 1 - m Pr , where Pw denotes the wholesale price, m denotes the gross margin measured as a percentage of the retail price, and Pr denotes the retail price.12
3c. Relevance of the Empirical Context. Before discussing the data analysis results, let us briefly consider the similarity of the data we are studying-- wholesale price data, and their source--a large retail supermarket chain, to the environment envisioned by the model described in the theoretical section of the paper. In particular, we want to assess the empirical validity of some of the assumptions on which the model is based.
The first assumption of the model is that the retailer faces costs of price adjustment. How valid is this assumption? In a recent series of papers, a group of scholars from marketing, economics, and organizational behavior study price change process and its cost at five large U.S. supermarket chains each operating between 100 to more than 1,000 stores, and demonstrate " that changing prices in these establishments is a complex process, requiring dozens of steps, and non-trivial amount of resources" (Levy et al. 1997, p. 791). They provide direct measures of these costs, finding that they lead to more than $100,000 per store annually (more than 35% of the net margin) at major grocery chains like the one examined in this study.13 Slade (1998) also estimates these costs to be as high as $2.72 per price change in grocery store chains of similar characteristics. Thus it has been documented in these studies that retail supermarket chains not only face costs of price adjustment, but that the costs are quite substantial.
A second assumption concerns the relative magnitudes of the manufacturer and retailer costs of price adjustment y x . Although manufacturers also face costs of price adjustment, they may not be as substantial in this industry because of the Robinson-Patman
12 The data set reports the variable "profit," which is defined as "the gross margin in percent that DFF makes on the sale of the UPC." See Peltzman (2000, p. 501) for a discussion.
13 The followup studies by Levy et al. (1998), Dutta et al. (1999), and Zbaracki et al. (2004), which explore other retail and wholesale settings, further confirm and reinforce the original findings. See also Blinder et al. (1998).

Act. This requires that all retailers have access to the same terms and conditions for goods of like grade and quality. Branded consumer packaged goods are often of like grade and quality in this industry (for consumer and logistical reasons). As such, much of the manufacturer pricing is setting the schedule in which all retailers have access. Although this may require a large amount of resources in aggregate, the costs for any particular retailer would be minimal.14
Our third assumption is about the fixed nature of the costs of price adjustment. In this regard, we have followed the existing theoretical studies of costly price adjustment models, which typically treat the costs as fixed.15 But more importantly, the studies by Levy et al. (1997, 1998), Dutta et al. (1999), and Slade (1998) find that the price adjustment costs the supermarkets face are indeed fixed.16 In fact, Slade (1998) estimates that the magnitude of the fixed component of theses costs exceed that of any variable component by a magnitude of about 15 times. According to Levy et al. (1997), the major steps required to change shelf prices include: tag change preparation, tag change itself, tag change verification, and resolution of price mistakes at the store, zone, or corporate level (pp. 798­799; also see their Figure 1). Therefore, many of the cost components, such as the labor time spent during the price tag change process, the cost of printing and delivering new price tags, and the cost of the in-store supervision time, do not change with the size of price change. Thus our assumption that price adjustment costs the supermarkets face are fixed (as opposed to convex) is consistent with the existing evidence on the nature of such costs in the retail supermarket setting.17
Our fourth assumption is that the manufacturers are aware of the existence of the retail price adjustment costs. This assumption seems reasonable. The retail price change processes and procedures are common knowledge amongst the practitioners. For example, dozens of articles have been published in numerous trade publications covering the supermarket industry on electronic shelf label systems and how they can reduce the price adjustment costs faced by
14 See Levy et al. (1997) for a discussion of the impact of centralized pricing to reduce the costs of price adjustment.
15 See, for example, Mankiw (1985) and Danziger (1987).
16 Alternatively, these costs could vary with the size of price change (i.e., the bigger the price change, the larger is its cost), which is known as "convex price adjustment cost."
17 However, these costs of price adjustments could be a function of such variables as market share of the products, whether a brand is a national brand or private label, and whether item pricing law is required in the areas where the retailer is operating (Levy et al. 2005). Examining how retailer's menu cost varies with these variables and its implications on asymmetric pricing are interesting avenues for future research. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing us in that direction.

retail supermarket chains, especially in states with item-pricing laws. Moreover, many manufacturers of direct store delivery products are themselves engaged in price change management and implementation in these retail stores. These manufacturers are, therefore, intimately familiar with price adjustment complexities and their costs.
Finally, we believe the assumption on demand stability is also reasonable. Most of the product categories included in our data set are mature categories, which have likely reached the limit of their market growth. Moreover, most of the products in these categories are staple goods, which suggest that large demand variations, which would be typical to fashion or fad goods, are unlikely.18
3d. Empirical Findings. Below we analyze the predictions of our theory for the entire data set as well as for each of the individual categories. In each case, we consider the entire sample period as well as two subsamples. One subsample includes only those weeks in which the monthly inflation rate was below 0.1%, which we call the low-inflation-period sample. The other subsample includes only those weeks in which the monthly inflation rate was 0% or less, which we call the deflation-period sample. For each subsample, we first consider price changes in cents (i.e., in absolute terms) and then in percent (i.e., in relative terms).19
Analysis of the Data for the Entire Sample Period. Recall that according to our theory, we expect to see more positive price changes "in the small." That is, we expect to see more small price increases than decreases. However, as the magnitude of the price change gets larger, we expect these differences to disappear.
The question that naturally arises is: What do we mean by "small"? Because the answer is not obvious, we have chosen to let the data tell us what may constitute a "small" price change in this market. To accomplish this, we have calculated the frequency of positive and negative price changes for each possible size of price change in cents: 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents, etc., up to 100 cents; as well as in percents: 1%, 2%, 3%, etc., up to 100%. The results are displayed in Figures 1­3 and Tables 1­3, corresponding to the entire sample, the low inflation subsample, and the deflation subsamples, respectively.
In Figure 1, we report the frequency of positive and negative price changes found in the entire DFF's
18 See Cagan (1974), Roll (1984), and Dutta et al. (2002).
19 The statistical analysis of these various combinations of sample periods/categories/units of measurement has yielded a total of 180 tables of 50 rows each (29 categories + 1 all categories combined × 3 samples/subsamples×2 units of measurement = 180). While these tables are too many to be included even in the referee's appendix, they are available to interested readers upon request.

than decreases. The difference appears particularly large for price changes of up to about 30 cents. Beyond that, the difference between the frequency of positive and negative price changes quickly disappears as the size of price changes increases. In fact, the two series become virtually indistinguishable beyond that point, at least visually. According to Table 1a, the frequency of price increases exceeds the frequency of price decreases in statistical terms as well: the higher frequency of positive price changes is systematically significant for absolute price changes of up to 36 cents. Beyond that, the two series crisscross each other without any systematic pattern.
A similar pattern is observed when we consider the frequency of price changes in relative terms, i.e., in percents. For price changes of up to about 8%­10%, we indeed see more price increases than decreases. Beyond that point, the two series do not exhibit a clear systematic pattern, as they crisscross each other. Further, the differences between positive and negative price changes slowly disappear. According to the figures in Table 1b, the higher frequency of positive price changes is systematically significant for relative price changes of up to 8%. Beyond that, the two series crisscross each other without any systematic pattern. Thus the results we find in terms of both absolute as well as relative terms are consistent with the model's prediction: for small price changes, there are more price increases than decreases. The asymmetry disappears for larger price changes.
Next, we consider the behavior of the wholesale price data for individual categories. We looked at the

frequency of negative and positive price changes first as a function of the size of price change in cents, and then in percents.20
20 Only the plots for Toothpastes are given in Figure 5. Because of sheer volume, the rest of the category-level plots are included in the Technical Appendix available at mktsci.pubs.informs.org.

We find that the frequency of positive price changes exceeds the frequency of negative price changes "in the small" for all 29 categories displayed. For most categories, the difference appears particularly strong for price changes of up to 10­15 cents. Beyond that, the two time series exhibit a very similar behavior, often merging with each other. We have con-

ducted formal statistical significance tests for each of the 29 individual categories, and they confirm our interpretation of the results: the frequency of positive price changes exceeds the frequency of negative price changes for all 29 categories included in our sample. According to these tests, for most categories, the asymmetry holds for absolute price changes of

between 5­20 cents. Table 4 reports these cutoff points for each category.
Now, consider the price change behavior in percents. We find that for all categories considered (the category of Beer being the only exception), the frequency of positive price changes exceeds the frequency of negative price changes "in the small." In most cases, "small" visually appears to mean about

5%­8% change. The results of a formal statistical testing of the hypothesis of asymmetry confirm this conclusion: they indicate that the asymmetry in relative terms holds for price changes in the range of 2%­9% with the majority of the categories falling in the range of 5%­8%. Table 4 reports these cutoff points for each category. Thus the analysis of asymmetry in relative terms reveals a greater homogeneity

across the 29 product categories. Overall, we conclude that the wholesale prices of every product category exhibit asymmetric pricing in the small, in both absolute and relative terms.

Notes. (1) The figures reported in the table are the cutoff points of what might constitute a "small" price change for each category. For each category, the cutoff point is the first point at which the asymmetry is not supported statistically. Thus, for example, in the Analgesics category, when the entire sample is used and we consider the price changes in cents, we see that for price changes of up to 30 cents, there is asymmetry as our theory predicts. Beyond that point, the asymmetry disappears. (2) In all tables, the critical values for 1%, 5%, and 10% significance are 2.575, 1.96, and 1.645, respectively.

States was experiencing inflation. In Figure 4, we plot the monthly inflation rate in the United States as measured by the Producer Price Index. We use the Producer Price Index because it is likely to be a better indicator of the wholesalers' costs than the more com-

monly used Consumer Price Index. Given that, during the period we study, there was inflation in the United States, it is possible that the finding we are documenting is merely a reflection of that fact. That is, during an inflation period, even if prices go up and down, we would expect that ceteris paribus, prices will go up more often than down.
One possible answer to this criticism, however, is that if the reason for the asymmetry we are documenting is inflation, then we should see more positive than negative price changes not only "in the small," but also "in the large." As discussed above, however, the data do not indicate such an asymmetry.
A direct, and perhaps more methodical, response to the above criticism can be given by conducting the following analysis. Let us try and see whether the asymmetric pricing we document "in the small" for the entire sample period also exists in the data when the observations pertaining to the inflationary periods are excluded from the analysis. Given our large sample of observations, such an analysis is possible.
We have conducted two versions of such an analysis. In the first, we included only those observations during which the monthly Producer Price Index inflation rate did not exceed 0.1%, a very low inflation rate by any historical standard. We call this a low/ zero inflation sample. In the second version, we took an even more conservative stand by including in the analysis only these observations in which the monthly inflation rate was zero or negative. We call this a deflation-period sample.
In Figures 2(a) and 2(b), we report the frequency of positive and negative price changes found in the DFF's wholesale prices during low/zero inflation periods. In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), we report the frequency of positive and negative price changes during deflation periods. Figures 2(a) and 3(a) display the frequency of price changes in cents, and Figures 2(b) and 3(b) in percents. In both low inflation and deflation periods, our substantive conclusions remain the same--we find significantly more price increases than decreases for small price changes. For absolute changes, the difference appears especially big for price changes of up to about 10­15 cents. For percentage changes, the difference appears large for

changes up to about 5%. Beyond these, the difference in the frequency of positive and negative price changes quickly disappears as the size of price change increases.
The findings remain unchanged for individual categories as well. The results are very similar to the findings reported for the entire data set. With the exception of Beer, the frequency of positive price changes exceeds the frequency of negative price changes "in the small" for all others. Formal statistical significance tests for each of the 28 categories confirmed that the asymmetry holds for absolute price changes of between 5­20 cents, with the difference

being particularly strong between 10­15 cents. In terms of percentage changes, the asymmetry holds for price changes of 11% or less, with the majority of the categories falling in the range of 5%­8%. Beyond these, the two time series exhibit a very similar behavior, often merging with each other, in both (cents and percents) cases. Thus the analysis of asymmetry in relative terms again reveals a greater homogeneity across the 29 product categories. Table 4 reports these cutoff points for each category.
Could the Results Be an Artifact of How the Wholesale Prices Are Calculated? Yet, another criti-

cism of our results could be that our findings are a direct result of the manner in which the wholesale prices are calculated. Our wholesale price, as reported in the DFF database, is based on the AAC. The AAC per unit is calculated as follows:
AAC t = Purch t × price t
+ EndInventory t - 1 - sales t
× AAC t - 1 · TotalInventory t -1
where Purch t = inventory bought in t; price t = per unit wholesale price paid in t; EndInventory t - 1 = inventory at end of t - 1; sales t = retail sales at t; TotalInventory t = total inventory at t
The Role of Forward Buying by Retailers. Can it be claimed that our results could be just an artifact of the manner in which AAC is calculated? Manufacturers often inform the retailer in advance of an impending temporary price reduction, permitting the retailer to completely deplete its inventory and then "forward buying" to overstock at the lower price (Peltzman 2000). Because new purchases form a large proportion of the total inventory in this case, the large discount shows up as a commensurately large reduction in AAC. On the other hand, a retailer buys less when the wholesale price goes up. Consequently, a wholesale price increase of the same large magnitude as the decrease considered earlier, will translate into a relatively smaller increase in AAC. Ceteris paribus, it is reasonable to expect that the observed asymmetry in the small therefore may be driven by such a forwardbuying phenomenon.21
In the absence of actual wholesale prices, how do we conduct a direct test to check for the above effect? Note that the forward-buying rationale suggests that if the manner of calculating AAC was the major driver of the observed asymmetry, it should be more pronounced for products that are subjected to greater degree of forward buying. For products not subject to major fluctuations in its purchases driven by promotional prices, we should expect much lesser degree of such systematic distortion. This leads to the following null proposition, which holds true if the manner of computing AAC was the major driver of our results.22
Forward-Buying Proposition. Products subject to greater degree of forward buying will exhibit greater asymmetry than products that are subject to lesser degree of forward buying.
21 We thank an anonymous reviewer for alerting us to this potential rival explanation of our results.
22 This is not to be confused with our theoretical proposition earlier. Here, we intend to check if the "null" (forward buying is a key driver of the observed asymmetry) can be rejected in favor of the "alternate" (that it is not).

Unfortunately, we do not have direct data on the degree of forward buying. However, several authors (Hoch and Banerji 1993, Rao 1991, Lal 1990) have suggested that, in general, private labels are not promoted as heavily, and hence are likely to be forward bought less than national brands.23 Therefore, a comparison of national brands to private labels provides a natural context to test the above proposition. In essence, if forward buying is the main driver of our results, the predicted asymmetry should be stronger for national brands than for private labels. We therefore undertook two additional analyses to explore whether, and to what extent, can our results be attributed to the method of computing AAC. In the paragraphs below, we discuss the data used for the test and briefly summarize the findings.
National Brand vs. Private Label Data. For the purposes of the test, we need data on comparable national brand (NB)­private label (PL) product pairs. We base our identification of such NB­PL pairs on a recently published study of Barsky et al. (2003), who use the same DFF data to investigate the size of markups for nationally branded products sold in the U.S. retail grocery industry. Their measure of markup is based on a comparison of the prices of matched pairs of NB­PL products. To implement their strategy, therefore, Barsky et al. (2003) had to identify the product pairs based on several comparability criteria, which included, among other attributes, product's quality, size, packaging, etc. For quality comparison, they used Hoch and Banerji's (1993) PL product quality rankings.
After filtering out the product pairs that were not comparable for various reasons (for example, size differences, quality differences, insufficient number of observations, etc.), Barsky et al. (2003) were left with 231 matched NB­PL product pairs of comparable size and quality, covering 19 product categories.24 These categories are Analgesics, Bottled Juices, Cereals, Cheeses, Cookies, Crackers, Canned Soups, Dish Detergent, Frozen Entrees, Frozen Juices, Fabric Softeners, Grooming Products, Laundry Detergents, Oatmeal, Snack Crackers, Toothpastes, Toothbrushes, Soft Drinks, and Canned Tuna. However, Barsky et al.
23 Hoch and Banerji (1993, p. 61) suggest national brands will promote more to reduce private label market share. Also, see Pauwels and Srinivasan (2004). Rao (1991, Table 1, p. 140) presents evidence from three product categories that shows private labels are promoted less frequently than national brands. Lal (1990) argues based on his theoretical model that " (the private label) has a constant retail price--that is, it is never promoted" (p. 433) and that " (the empirical evidence) do not contradict the second hypothesis that the local/store brand is promoted less often than the national brands" (p. 439).
24 See Barsky et al. (2003, Tables 7A.1­7A.19) for a detailed list of the NB­PL product pairs.

(2003) argue that Toothbrushes category is an outlier for its unusually high markup ratio, in comparison to the remaining 18 categories. Consequently, they omit the Toothbrushes category from much of their analysis.25 Following their strategy, therefore, we also exclude the category of Toothbrushes from our analysis, which leaves us with 18 categories of matched NB­PL pairs for the analysis.
The first analysis compared the aggregate asymmetries between national brands and private labels. No significant difference was found either in the absolute (cents) or relative (percents) asymmetry thresholds. We also did not find any statistical difference in the degrees of asymmetry when we considered the difference between the number of positive and negative changes expressed as a percentage of the number of positive changes.
The second analysis compared category-level asymmetries between national brands and private labels. Again, we found no evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference between the two groups either in absolute (cents) or relative (percents) terms.26
Forward Buying Is Not a Key Driver of the Observed Asymmetry in the Small. To conclude, it is unlikely that our empirical results are an artifact of the manner in which the wholesale prices have been calculated. We subject the data to a series of tests to check if there are patterns consistent with the forward-buying hypotheses. None of the analyses, whether descriptive, or statistical, provide support for these hypotheses.
Such a conclusion must, however, be tempered with the knowledge that we are after all dealing with a derived measure of wholesale prices, and a better test of our theory would be with actual wholesale prices. Unfortunately, such data are not available. We are not unique in dealing with this problem. A number of other authors who have dealt with it bemoan the lack of proper wholesale price data (cf. Cecchetti 1986, Peltzman 2000, Chintagunta 2002, Levy et al. 2002, Chevalier et al. 2003, etc.). Creative approaches like estimating wholesale prices from regression, which is particularly common in the empirical industrial organization literature (see Carlton and Perloff 1994), using aggregate price indexes as a proxy, such as Wholesale Price Index (Cecchetti 1986), rough accounting estimates (Nevo 2001), and even simulation (Tellis and Zufryden 1995) are the norm in such cases. Others may ignore explicit consideration of wholesale prices altogether (Gerstner et al. 1994, Pesendorfer 2002).
25 See Barsky et al. (2003, p. 194).
26 Details of these tests are in a technical appendix available at mktsci.pubs.informs.org.

While the lack of accurate wholesale price data is unfortunate, we believe that should not hinder theory building in the domain of wholesale prices. Nevertheless, the onus is on the researcher to ensure that any empirical test of theory using weak wholesale data is actually robust to the weakness of the data. It is in that spirit that we conducted these additional checks.
To keep things in perspective, therefore it is necessary to understand that while we stand behind the spirit of our results, we recognize that the verity of the exact magnitudes of the asymmetry we report is subject to some uncertainty.
Overall, by ruling out inflation and forward buying as potential rival explanations of our results, we conclude that our theory offers the most consistent explanation of the observed asymmetry in the small.27
4. Discussion
Our primary goal in this paper is to offer and empirically validate a theory of asymmetric pricing. To this end, we offer a channel-based theory of asymmetric pricing--that costs of price adjustment for downstream channel members can create an incentive for asymmetric pricing by upstream channel members. We go on to present evidence of asymmetric wholesale pricing "in the small" with symmetric wholesale pricing "in the large," which is consistent with this theory. To the best of our knowledge, no other paper reports such patterns of asymmetries at the wholesale level.
Theoretically, this paper merges two different lines of research: (1) costs of price adjustment in economics and (2) distribution channels in marketing. By themselves, neither implies asymmetry. Traditional economic theories based on costs of price adjustment suggest that nominal rigidities are usually symmetric, with "prices (responding) similarly to positive and negative shocks" (Ball and Mankiw 1994, p. 247). Similarly, channels of distribution are often argued to be a source of many pricing distortions, (e.g., double marginalization--Jeuland and Shugan 1983, free riding--Bergen and John 1997), but not asymmetry. Taken together, however, costs of price adjustment and channels of distribution suggest ranges of asymmetric pricing by the upstream firm.
27 Other authors using this data set (e.g., Peltzman 2000) restrict their sample till September 1994 because of a change in manufacturers' pricing policies from that point in time. To maintain comparability and to rule out this policy change as a driver of our results, we conduct an additional analysis by restricting our sample to the pre-September 1994 period. The details of this test are in the technical appendix available at mktsci.pubs.informs.org. Our central result remains unaffected by this change, thereby ruling it out as a central driver of our results. We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this additional check.

Because most of the existing research has focused on asymmetric pricing by a single decision maker (primarily, the retailer), we expand the scope of asymmetry research by explicitly exploring the implications of the business-to-business linkages in a channel. This builds on a long tradition in marketing of using the distribution channel to improve our understanding of a variety of marketing issues beyond the traditional scope of the channels literature.28
By combining a channels perspective with the costs of price adjustment perspective, we generate predictions and empirical findings that cannot be easily explained by the existing theories of asymmetric pricing. For example, asymmetry that is driven by inflation (Ball and Mankiw 1994) cannot account for asymmetry in noninflationary periods, or deflationary periods that we observe in our data. Similarly, market power-based explanations for wholesale asymmetry suggest that asymmetric adjustments may be a means to extract monopoly rent from retailers (Benabou and Gertner 1993, Borenstein and Shepard 1996). Yet, this does not explain why we observe asymmetry in small, but not in large wholesale price changes. In the same way, the differences in elasticities and costs across levels of the distribution channel, required to explain asymmetry in Madsen and Yang (1998), does not explain why asymmetry occurs in the small, but not in the large. More generally, Peltzman (2000) concludes, " attributing asymmetries to imperfect competition is unlikely to be rewarding."
There are also some promising cross-disciplinary theoretical directions that this paper suggests. We extend the marketing literature on channels of distribution to explicitly considering the costs of price adjustment and its implications on channels pricing behavior. Traditionally, these costs of price adjustment have been known as "menu costs" (Ball and Mankiw 1994) and are associated primarily with price rigidity. Although we focus on asymmetric pricing issues, there are many other natural applications for marketers to explore. One direction is how these costs of price adjustment impact pass-through of manufacturer price changes (cf. Kim and Staelin 1999, Tyagi 1999). There is a literature in economics called "stages of processing" that is related to channels of distribution. It has considered the extent of pass-through in the context of studying price rigidity/flexibility in stages of processing, but has not explored price asymmetry. The main focus of these studies has been on the effect of the number of stages of processing on the degree of price flexibility. For example, Blanchard (1983) focuses on the role of price adjustment costs on
28 Examples include product introduction and design (Rao and McLaughlin 1989, Villas-Boas 1998), unbundling (Wilson et al. 1990), advertising (Bergen and John 1997), etc.

the degree of price rigidity in markets with a stages of processing structure (which though not identical, quite resembles the channels structure), and Basu (1995) who studies the role of price adjustment costs in economies with the input-output structure, which is an alternative way of looking at the organization of production in market economies (see also Gordon 1990).
In expanding the costly price adjustment theory to include channels of distribution, we explore how the presence of these costs may fundamentally alter the nature of transactions within the channel as well. The implications are not just price rigidity, which is a direct effect of these costs, but asymmetric pricing, which is more strategic in nature. This suggests that this literature broadens its consideration to look at the impacts of these costs on the incentives and actions of related parties to transactions.
Empirically, we document systematic evidence of asymmetric pricing that, taken in the context of previous empirical research, is particularly surprising. Specifically, Peltzman (2000) studies the same DFF's data set and reports finding no systematic evidence of asymmetry. Yet, our results are actually more complementary than contradictory to Peltzman's (2000). The key differences between the papers are the location and size of asymmetry within the distribution channel. While Peltzman (2000) looked downstream, we look for asymmetry in upstream channel prices. This, in turn, addresses one of Peltzman's (2000) own conclusions that the "vertical market linkages" of a distribution channel may be key factors in asymmetric adjustment. Additionally, Peltzman (2000) looks for asymmetry overall, both the large and the small without distinguishing between the two. Our results suggest the need to consider differences in asymmetry within the magnitude continuum as well.
Finally, our paper has public policy implications. Generally speaking, marketing scholars over the years have consistently called for greater involvement of marketers in shaping public policy (cf. Alderson 1937, Guiltinan and Gundlach 1996). More specifically, policy implications of pricing strategies have been a central concern for a number of marketing researchers (Gerstner and Hess 1990, Wilkie et al. 1998, etc.). Yet, the literature is relatively sparse and in a recent editorial, Grewal and Compeau (1999) point out that " (there is a need for) marketing researchers to examine the public policy issues raised by the strategic pricing practices firms employ." Asymmetric pricing is such a strategy and has not escaped the view of policymakers who worry about prices that are too quick to rise, but are not clear about the central causes. This is evidenced in headlines such as: "California politicians ask for price caps on electricity" (CNN.com 2001), or in comments such as

149

U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's: "We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy, instead of dealing with the real issues" (CNN.com 2001). Our perspective suggests that there may be asymmetric pricing upstream in the channel. But this upstream asymmetry may be bounded by the size of the costs of price adjustment of downstream channel members. Any concern with asymmetric pricing must therefore factor in the efficiency issues inherent in such costs. For example, asymmetric pricing is less likely to be a significant concern for channels that invest in reducing such costs.
5. Conclusions
This paper is only another step in our understanding of asymmetric pricing. It does suggest future theoretical work to explore additional implications of costs of price adjustment on pricing, contracting, and design of channels of distribution. Presently, this theory is only applicable in upstream channel pricing. The logic of asymmetric pricing may be extended to retail pricing decisions as well. A couple of recent papers (Chen et al. 2005, Müller and Ray 2006) explore the implications for retail pricing decisions. We call for more investigations in the same vein. We did not have access to wholesaler's cost data. If such data were to become available, future empirical work could take advantage of it to directly assess the implications of this theory. In addition, future work could explore the cross-category differences (Hoch et al. 1995) in the extent of asymmetry.
On another note, recall that we show asymmetric adjustment of wholesale prices is a subgame-perfect equilibrium in a two-period model. One especially promising area of future theoretical research would be to explore the implications for the results if we extend the model to longer time horizons. Such an extension can be done in several ways. If we merely extend the game to n periods, the results are unlikely to be substantively different from the conclusions we draw from our simpler model. However, the outcomes are not intuitive in a model with repeated strategic interactions between manufacturers and retailers. In this context, note that a benefit of having forward-looking retailers in our current model is that--equilibrium retailers are not disadvantaged by asymmetric pricing in the small--they adjust their initial pricing decisions to reflect this economic reality. So, it is not clear that a richer space of punishments, relationships, or prices would necessarily be of any improvement to the retailer in this situation. The costs are real, and as such, any solution would have to factor them into the equilibrium. Nevertheless, while we suspect that

asymmetry will still be an equilibrium outcome, more rigorous theoretical efforts are needed before a definitive answer can be given.
Finally, we hope this paper reinforces the value of bringing scholars in marketing and economics together to study issues of common interest. This paper brings a marketing perspective to this dialog by conducting this investigation in the context of a distribution channel and by considering store-level marketing data. We believe this is the first paper in marketing to incorporate costs of price adjustment explicitly into their analysis. There are a variety of issues in marketing that may benefit from a consideration of these costs of price adjustment in the area of pass-through, promotional pricing, everyday low pricing, etc. It also brings an economic perspective to this dialogue in the work on asymmetric pricing and costs of price adjustment, areas where marketing researchers are relative newcomers but may have important insights and evidence to bring to these areas of inquiry. We feel that both disciplines can benefit greatly from these kinds of cross-disciplinary explorations.

Appendix
A.0. General Case of Channel with Costs of Price Adjustment
The general setup of the model is given in the main body of this paper. The solution proceeds by first solving for the t1 prices w1 and p1, given any t0 prices p0 and w0. Subsequently, the t0 results are obtained by incorporating the t1 solutions. Substituting these back into the t1 period solutions gives the final results.
Adjustment Period t1. The solutions are obtained first by solving for = 1 and then for = 0. In the first case, x is a fixed exogenous parameter and does not affect the first-order conditions: Hence arg maxp p - w D p - x = arg maxp p - w D p . The retailer's price reaction function p1 w solves

Ray, Chen, Bergen, and Levy: Asymmetric Wholesale Pricing: Theory and Evidence

150

p w = p1 w s.t. where

p= w 1 - 1/ r1

r1 =

r1 w

=-

log D log p

(A.1)

Now, the retailer will implement a new price = 1 only
if by doing so it is going to be better off than by staying
at p0. It will not change price = 0 if p1 w -w D p1 w - x  p0 - w D p0 . The retailer's solution therefore is

p w = p1 w if p1 w p0 x

p0

otherwise

(A.2)

where

p1 w p0 x  R p1 w - x > R p0 and
R p = p-w D p
The t1 period wholesale prices for the manufacturer is obtained by solving

m1 = max w1

w1 - c - c D p1 - y

(A.3)

The manufacturer incurs a cost y when it changes price

= 1 from w0. When it does not change price, = 0. The manufacturer solutions must also internalize the

effects of x. There are three possible outcomes: (1) both

the manufacturer and the retailer readjust their prices,

(2) the manufacturer does but the retailer does not readjust, and (3) neither readjusts.29

The wholesale solutions then are expressed as

 w1

if p1 w1 p0 x and

w1 w0 p w1 y

w1 = w11 w0

if if

C p1 w11 p0 x and C w11 w0 p w0 y

w11 w0 p w11 y

(A.4)

where p w is the retail reaction function to wholesale prices

p1 w p0 x  R p1 w - x > R p0 C ·  R p1 w - x  R p0
w1 w0 p w y  M w1 - y > M w0 C ·  M w1 - y  M w0
R p = p-w D p
M w = w-c- c D p w
w1 = arg max w - c + c D p1 w s.t. w p1 w1 p0 x and w1 w0 p w1 y
w11 = arg max w - c + c D p0 s.t. w
C p1 w11 p0 x and w11 w0 p w11 y
The corresponding retail prices are given by

(A.5)

p1 =

p1 p0

if p1 w1 p0 x and otherwise

w1 w0 p w1 y (A.6)

29 The alternative where the retailer readjusts but the manufacturer does not is not feasible in our setup, because if the wholesale prices do not change, retail prices remain unchanged as well.

The and conditions in the first rows of both the

manufacturer and retailer solutions can now be redefined

in terms of the cost changes. In particular, using procedures

similar to that used earlier in the main paper, we can show

the existence of cr and cm with properties and cm / y > 0, respectively, such that

cr / x > 0

·  c > cr and ·  c > cm

(A.7)

Initial Period t0. The t1 solutions are then incorporated into the t0 problem to solve for p0 and w0. First, the retail reaction function p0 w0 is obtained from

Max p0 p1e

p0 - w0 D p0 + p1e - w1e D p1e

(A.8)

where p1e = p0 + pe and w1e = w0 + we, the superscript "e" denoting the prices expected by the retailer in the adjust-
ment period. Next, this is substituted into the manufacturer
problem to solve

Max w0 w1e

w0 - c D p0 w0 + w1e - c - E c D p1e

(A.9)

where E c is the expectation of c based on the distribu-
tional assumptions made earlier. The solutions p0 and w0 are then substituted back into
the t1 solutions to get p1 and w1. With this general problem as the background, we will
now consider the role of the upstream costs of price adjustment, y for our results.30

A.1. Pricing with Only Upstream Costs of Price Adjustment y > 0 x  0 : Rigidity
We start by exploring the role of y in isolation of any channel effects. For this, we set x  0 and let y > 0. The results show that y by itself only leads to price rigidity but not asymmetry.
Adjustment Period t1. The manufacturer will not implement a new price if it is better off by staying at w0. Since p0 remains the profit-maximizing retail price if wholesale prices remain at w0, the condition when the wholesale does not change can be written as

w1 - c + c D p1 w1 - y  w0 - c + c D p0 (A.10) The equilibrium channel prices can then be expressed as

w1 p1 =

w1 p1 w0 p0

if w1 w0 p w y otherwise

(A.11)

where w1 solves w = c + c / 1 - 1/ m1 ; p1 = p1 w1 ; as defined earlier in (A.5), is given by

w1 w0 p w y  M w1 - y > M w0 with M w = w - c - c D p w
Using procedures similar to earlier, it follows from (A.10) and (A.11) that there exists a cx0 with the

30 For ease of exposition and notational economy, we will hence-
forth derive the t1 period solutions as functions of w0 and p0 and solve for the functional forms of w0 and p0 later when solving the t0 period problem.

property cx0 / y > 0 such that prices are unchanged for

c  cx0 .

(A.12)

Hence the primary contribution of price adjustment costs

at the manufacturer end in this setup is price rigidity at

both wholesale and retail when cost changes are small enough.

For c > cx0 , wholesale prices adjust to w1 and retail prices to p1. Notice that this adjustment pattern is symmetric in that both negative and positive c will elicit match-

ing positive and negative price adjustments. In fact, if we

abstract away from the channel and look at the price adjust-

ment decisions of an individual economic agent (i.e., when

p w = w),31 we are led to conclude that while it leads to price

rigidity, price adjustment cost per se does not lead to asymmetric

pricing. This is a standard result in the costs of adjustment

literature (cf. Carlton 1986, Danziger 1987, Kashyap 1995,

etc.).

Initial Period t0. Now, note that the rigidity imposed by y creates a potential marginal distortion for the manu-
facturer of magnitude cx0 . In this region of small costs changes, there would be no change in demand as there
would be no change in manufacturer prices. In other words,
even if costs were to go up by cx0 (with the commensurate negative effect on profits), the manufacturer will not adjust its
prices in t1. A profit-maximizing manufacturer would incorporate this in its t0 solution. The t0 solution for manufacturer prices therefore is obtained by setting E c = cx0 :

max w w - c D p0 + w - c - cx0 D p0

(A.12)

The solution gives w0, which solves

w

=

2c + 2 1-

cx0 1/ m0

where

m0 = 0 p0 w

=-

log D log w

(A.13)

This price would remain in effect in t1 unless c > cx0 , when as per the t1 period solutions, prices will adjust symmetrically. The manufacturer acting in a forward-looking

manner therefore compensates for its cost of adjustment by

charging cx0 / 2 1 - 1/ m0 more in the initial period than what it would charge if it did not have any such costs.

A.2. Pricing with Both Up and Downstream Costs of

Price Adjustment y > 0 x > 0

We now consider the more general case discussed earlier

x > 0 y > 0 . This explores how y may affect the asym-

metry results obtained earlier. The main conclusion is that

y implies regions of wholesale price rigidity, but not asym-

metry. We start by considering the different cases dependent

on the relative magnitude of y.

First, for convenience, we present the general solution for

period t1 in terms of the ranges of cost changes

 

w1

p1

if c > cr and c > cm

w1

p1

= 

w11 w0

p0 p0

c > cm

(A.14)

31 Essentially, completely ignoring the existence of the retailer in the above case.

1. Large y: Rigidity Suppose now, y is large y x . In particular, let y be large enough such that cm  cr .32
Adjustment Period t1. When cm  cr , the condition in the second row of the manufacturer solution is not feasible. We can then rewrite the equilibrium channel prices in t1 as

w1 p1 =

w1 p1 w0 p0

if c > cm otherwise

(A.15)

Hence, for large y, the main implication of price adjustment costs is still one of rigidity in channel prices for small enough cost changes.

Initial Period t0. In t0, the retailer solution is simply p0 =

w0/

1 - 1/

 r0

.

The manufacturer solution, on the other hand, is obtained

in a manner similar to the earlier subsection, by consider-

ing cm instead of cx0:

w0

=

2c + cm

2

1 - 1/

 m0

where

 m0

=

0 p0 w0

=-

log D log w

(A.16)

2. Small y: Asymmetry

Let y be small: y x. In particular, let y be small enough

such that cm < cr . In this subsection, we will first solve the t1 prices and derive the t0 prices for the special cases of different magnitudes of y discussed subsequently.

The t1 equilibrium prices can be derived from (A.4) and

(A.15), which are equivalent. From (A.15), if cm < cr ,

then c > cm is identically satisfied whenever c >

cr and w1, p1 are the equilibrium prices. Then, w1 =

is

the

solution

to

maxw

c

·

D p1 w s.t. c > cr .

From the functional form, it is clear that given small y, for

large enough cost changes c > cr , the wholesale price here is still symmetric with respect to positive and negative directions

of cost changes.

p1 can be obtained from the retail reaction function p1 =

w1/

1 - 1/

 r1

.

Now, what happens when the costs changes are small--

specifically, c  cr ? From (A.15), w11 is the solution to maxw w - c + c D p0 . Using the equivalency between (A.4) and (A.15), since demand is independent of w, this

maximization boils down simply to maximizing w subject

to the conditions C · and · in (A.4). The C · implies

p1 - w11 D p1 - x  p0 - w11 D p0 . Using procedures similar to that employed earlier, we can express this as

- wr  w  wr

where

wr =

p1 - w0 D p1 - p0 - w0 D p0 D p0 - D p1

+x

(A.17)

Since the maximization exercise involves maximizing the wholesale price, w11 = w0 + wr is the profit-maximizing

32 Recall that cm / y > 0.

solution.33 The corresponding condition can therefore be

written as (w0 + D p0 or

wr - c - c D p0 - y > w0 - c - c ·

wr D p0 > y

(A.18)

So, as expected, for small cost changes c  cr , the results predict asymmetry. However, this asymmetry appears

contingent on certain magnitudes of y. So, now let us consider

the implication the magnitude of y has on the final solu-

tions. Let

y = wr D p0

(A.19)

Case A y > y.
Adjustment Period t1. If y > y, the corresponding condition (A.19) is always violated ( c  cm and manufacturer prices remain unchanged at w0. Without any change in wholesale prices, the retail prices also remain unchanged at p0. Hence, when y is large enough, the results predict rigidity for both upstream and downstream prices.

Initial Period t0. Since cm represents the marginal distortion because of its costs of price changes, the manufacturer sets the w0 that maximizes

m

=

Max w

w-c D p w

+ w-c-

cm D p w

The solution gives w0, which solves

w0

=

2c 21

+ cm

- 1/

 m0

where

 m0

=

0 p0 w0

=-

log D log w

(A.20)

As before, the manufacturer, acting in a forward-looking

manner, therefore compensates for its cost of adjustment by

charging

cm

/

2

1 - 1/

 m0

more in the initial period than

what it would charge if it did not have any such costs.

p0 is obtained by substituting w0 into the retail reaction

function p0 = w0/

1 - 1/

 r1

.

Case B 0  y  y.

Adjustment Period t1. If y is quite small, in particular, if y  y, the condition (A.19) is identically satisfied for all c. When (A.19) is thus satisfied, w11 = w0 + wr is the solution.
The equilibrium channel prices when 0 < y  y then are

w1 p1 =

w1 p1 w0 + wr p0

if c > cr otherwise

(A.21)

p1 can be derived by substituting w1 in the reaction function

p1 w1

= w1/ 1 - 1/

 r1

,

which

would

be

symmetric

to

any

changes in wholesale prices.

Hence, when y is small enough, the results predict asymmetry

for upstream prices. This is very similar to the effect illus-

trated in the main paper.

33 w11 > w11 is not profit maximizing here. In that case, w > wr and the C condition is violated--in other words, the retail price will change and our maximization exercise will be different, with w1 as the profit-maximizing outcome.

Initial Period t0. The initial period solutions are obtained as solved in the main paper. Essentially, the retailer's solu-
tion would take into account the expected wholesale prices
in the next period. This price would remain in effect unless w > wr . The equilibrium retail price at t0 therefore is
obtained from

r

=

max p

p - w0 D p w

+ p - w0 -

The solution gives p0

wr D p w (A.22)

p0

=

2w0 + 2 1 - 1/

wr
 r0

where

 r0

=

0 p0 = -

log D log p

(A.23)

To derive the manufacturer prices, we fold the retail solu-
tion back into the manufacturer problem. In doing so, we
consider the magnitude of the expected cost change and
the upward adjustment of the wholesale prices as discussed earlier in the main paper. To set w0, therefore, the manufacturer maximizes over the two periods as

m

=

max w

w - c D p0 w

+ w + wr - c D p0 w

(A.24)

The solution gives

w0

=

2c - 2 1-

wr

1/

 m0

where

 m0

=

0 p0 w0

=-

log D log w

(A.25)

These t0 prices remain in effect unless the magnitude of the cost change is large enough c > cr to effect a change in channel prices.

Consider now the implications of the solutions for chan-

nel prices. For retail prices, we still predict symmetric adjust-

ment for large cost changes c > cr , but (symmetric) rigidity when cost changes are small enough ( c  cr .
For wholesale prices, the results are a function of the

magnitude of y. When y is large y > y , we get (symmet-

ric) rigidity for small costs changes c  cr . When the cost change is large enough c > cr , we get symmetric adjustment. When y is small y  y , however, we get

asymmetry for small costs changes c  cr and symmetric adjustment for large ones c > cr .
The intuition behind the asymmetry results is derived

from the impact of the retailer's costs of price adjustment, x

and the resulting retail price rigidity. This creates a region of

wholesale price changes (both positive and negative) where

the demand is inelastic, leading to the asymmetric adjust-

ment of wholesale prices. The manufacturer costs, y, how-

ever, does not play any direct role in this asymmetry. Its

primary role in this setup is to determine when the man-

ufacturer will not find it profitable to change its wholesale

prices. Since retail prices only change following wholesale

price changes, this implies that y's primary contribution is

in determining regions of wholesale, and by corollary, retail

price rigidity.

Interestingly, wholesale asymmetry (when wholesale

price changes in the adjustment period) persists even for

very small cost changes in spite of the fact that manufac-

turer costs of price adjustment y > 0. This happens because,

in the region of retail rigidity, the manufacturer can com-

pensate y by the increase in profits that follows asymmetric

positive adjustment. However, this is only true for small enough y. For large enough y, this asymmetry will not happen because the manufacturer cannot compensate y by the increase in profits because of the asymmetric adjustment. If y is so large that the manufacturer will implement only a large wholesale price change, we may not see any rigidity at retail because the magnitude of wholesale price change may be larger than the region of retail rigidity.
It is worthwhile to note that even if wholesale asymmetry is a direct result of retail rigidity, it does not imply that retailers will be taken advantage of. The fact that forwardlooking retailers will take these costs into account when setting initial and future prices is a standard result in the economics literature. In our case, the nature of the expected distortions in the adjustment period, introduced by these costs, is incorporated in the initial period prices.
In conclusion, when y is large y x , the main prediction is rigidity in channel prices for small enough cost changes. However, generally speaking, y x.34 In this case, wholesale price changes are symmetric with respect to large positive and negative cost changes. However, for small cost changes, the results predict asymmetry, depending on the magnitude of y. Specifically, when y > y, where y = wr D p0 , the results predict rigidity for both upstream and downstream prices. However, when y  y, the results predict asymmetry for upstream prices. This is stated in the following research proposition.
Proposition 1A. When y is small 0 < y  y , there is a range of cost changes for which the manufacturer will adjust its wholesale prices asymmetrically. In particular, the manufacturer will only adjust its prices upwards regardless of the direction of cost changes, in a region of cost changes of small magnitudes: - cr  c  cr . For cost changes of larger magnitudes, the wholesale prices will adjust symmetrically.
