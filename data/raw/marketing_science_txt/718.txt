This paper studies the pricing problem of a durable-goods monopolist. It finds that contrary to the existing literature, profits from selling durable goods might be higher than from leasing when the products exhibit network effects. Under the influence of network effects, there exist multiple self-fulfilling equilibria that would sustain different network sizes at the same price. By using the assumption that consumers are cautious about network growth, we find that consumption externalities among heterogeneous groups of consumers generate a discontinuous demand function, which requires a lessor to offer a low price if she wants to reach the mass market. In contrast, a seller enjoys a relative advantage in that she can build a customer base by setting a lower initial price and raise the price later in the mass market. Our finding that selling can be more profitable than leasing holds when consumers are more cautious about the prospect of the product's success, which might be the case if, for example, the technology or manufacturer is relatively unknown.

1. Introduction
When the market for personal computers started to flourish in the early 1980s, Microsoft aggressively promoted its operating system by reducing the license fees of MS-DOS by half for a brief period of time.1 Yet as soon as Microsoft prevailed in both operating system and application software for personal computers, it adopted a new pricing plan in which business users paid annual subscription fees.2 The path of Microsoft's pricing strategies defied the conventional wisdom that dictates the relative advantage of leasing over selling for durable goods.
This paper proposes that Microsoft's pricing strategies might be driven by the network effects of its product. That is, to take advantage of network effects the firm wants to establish an installed user base in the early stage of a product's life cycle and selling proves to be a more effective strategy than leasing. The situation shifts when the market matures and the concern for building the network starts to fade.
1 See Manes and Andrews (1993). Cabral et al. (1999) discuss other examples in computer software.
2 Evidently, this new pricing strategy was so much in favor of Microsoft that its deployment provoked strong opposition from the customers. Microsoft eventually suspended the Office XP subscription plan for the U.S. market because of the pressure.

Therefore, at a later stage the business strategy would resemble that of a conventional firm, which opts for leasing rather than selling a durable product.
The idea of network effects used here draws on the work of Rohlfs (1974), which holds that the more total buyers there are in the market, the higher each individual's willingness to pay. This attribute accurately describes a distinctive market characteristic for many products in the digital economy. In our paper, we predict the use of preemptive strategies such as the deep discount in the example of MS-DOS. Our goal is to provide a model that describes the two-staged pricing path during which the firm would switch from selling to leasing when it has sufficiently penetrated the market of a network product.
The impetus of our analysis comes from the observation that adopting an emerging technology takes time. Normally, the better-informed professional group adopts it first; then the information spreads gradually, leading to the adoption by less-informed, less professional groups, etc.3 Rohlfs (1974) and Katz
3 Although Waldman (1993) considers a similar setup with different groups of consumers joining the market sequentially, consumers' willingness to pay in his model is assumed to be identical within each group. Therefore, pricing strategy is irrelevant in the monopolist's decision.

and Shapiro (1986) have pointed out that market expansion coupled with network effects could result in multiple market equilibria. In other words, the potential buyers' expectations could sustain different network sizes for the same price. Therefore, equilibrium selection plays a crucial role when determining the firm's pricing strategy.
By assuming that consumers can coordinate their actions at the most efficient outcome, the conventional analysis of network effects is to select the equilibrium that maximizes consumers' total surplus.4 In this paper, we envision a situation where consumers are more conservative about their expectations of network growth. Accordingly, we select the stable equilibrium with a different network size. Our selection criterion results in a possibly discontinuous demand function--a small decrease in price at the critical point generates a discrete jump in sales. Thus, when the market expands, the monopolist should exercise penetration pricing by "offering a low price to invade another market" (Shapiro and Varian 1999, p. 288).5 In effect, the demand discontinuity places a restriction on the monopolist's choice of quantities, a unique phenomenon that we call penetration-pricing constraint. Under this constraint, the firm can either access the niche market (small quantity) with a high price, or reach the mass market (large quantity) with a low price. The effects will depend on whether the monopolist sells or leases the product. In the first possible scenario, the seller has the option to establish a larger customer base in the beginning, which changes the residual demand and enables the seller to raise the price later and take full advantage of the network growth.6 Such an option is not feasible to the lessor because she cannot demand renters committing to continuous renting.7 Essentially, the seller's optimal strategy is to sacrifice her profits in the early
4 See, for example, Economides and Himmelberg (1995). Note, however, that some authors have analyzed various processes of coordination by consumers (e.g., Farrell and Katz 2005).
5 Lee and O'Connor (2003) also assert that a penetration-pricing strategy during product launch performs better than a skimming pricing strategy for network effects products.
6 A seller cannot always commit customers to continue using her product. For instance, an owner of e-book reader devices can abandon his current reader at any time and adopt a new device that supports different formats of e-books. Such switching effectively curtails network externalities for a particular format, and thereby limits the seller's benefits from her commitment power. We thank a referee for pointing out the caveat and suggesting this example.
7 When there are switching costs, the monopolist could lock in some early renters and establish a customer base in rental market. In effect, the presence of switching costs changes the demand of rental units in period 2 by shifting inverse demand upward for all x < x1l, where x1l is the period-1 rental quantity. Thus, the producer still encounters a discontinuous demand; the disadvantage of leasing due to the penetration-pricing constraint does not vanish.

stage to capitalize the gains later. In contrast, the lessor extracts maximal profits early on, but her pricing choice later is limited by the penetration-pricing constraint.
We further show that a selling scenario might generate higher profits than leasing, depending on the market conditions. When the market is burgeoning, the monopolist is likely to prefer selling the product. However, when the market matures, resorting to a rental-based pricing model might be optimal. Thus, our model fully describes the life cycle of a network product, and it fits well with the evolution of pricing strategies illustrated by the example of Microsoft.
In sum, this paper establishes that the existence of network effects will lead a monopolist to favor selling her durable products over leasing under certain market conditions. This finding is in stark contrast to the conventional wisdom in the literature of durable-goods monopoly as well as that of network effects, many of which focus on the selling scenario while assuming that leasing is not feasible. In comparison, the decision of selling or leasing in our model is endogenous, and therefore the results are more robust.
Our work draws on two streams of research. The first studies the implications of network effects, while the second examines a durable-goods monopolist's choice between selling and leasing. Economics literature has analyzed various aspects of network effects, such as the issues of standardization and compatibility and their welfare implications (Katz and Shapiro 1985, 1986; Farrell and Saloner 1985). Meanwhile, marketing research on network effects has mainly focused on the strategic implications for individual firms, such as pricing, choices of product features, product upgrade, etc. For instance, Dhebar and Oren (1985) demonstrate that introductory pricing is optimal for a monopolist to market a product that exhibits network effects. Xie and Sirbu (1995) extend this finding to the scenario with a duopoly. Sun et al. (2004) explore the market conditions under which different product strategies such as technology licensing and product-line extension can be more profitable. Chen and Xie (2007) demonstrate that asymmetry in customer loyalty can turn a first-mover advantage into a disadvantage in the presence of cross-market network effects. Hauser et al. (2006) provide an excellent survey and identify challenges for research on network effects.
The leasing-selling decision has been analyzed in both economics and marketing literature. Bulow (1982) and Stokey (1981) demonstrate that leasing avoids the problem of time inconsistency and hence is more profitable than selling. Other authors have proposed various circumstances under which the assertion no longer holds. These include entry of new

customers that leads to price cycles (Conlisk et al. 1984, Sobel 1991), entry deterrence of new competitors (Bulow 1986, Bucovetsky and Chilton 1986), increasing marginal costs (Kahn 1986), depreciation of goods (Bond and Samuelson 1987, Desai and Purohit 1998), discrete demand (Bagnoli et al. 1989), competitiveness of the market and reliability of the product (Desai and Purohit 1999). Our analysis adds to the literature by pointing out that network externalities have similar effects that induce a durable-goods monopolist to favor selling over leasing.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In §2, we present the basic model that characterizes network effects. By using this model, we provide a theoretical foundation for inverted U-shaped demands that are commonly seen in the network effect literature. In §3, we provide a numerical example of dynamic pricing to illustrate our point. We then formulate and solve the general dynamic-pricing problems faced by a monopolist in §4. The final section discusses the results and presents our conclusions.
2. Network Effect: A Characterization
2.1. Consumer Preferences We consider a durable good that exhibits network externalities. The good is sold by a monopoly and lasts two periods. For simplicity, we assume that the monopolist's discount factor is zero. The monopolist's goal is to maximize the aggregate revenues. There are two heterogeneous groups of consumers in the economy. The first consists of early adopters. These consumers arrive at the market in period 1, and hence have the opportunity to enjoy the product early on. The second group of consumers are the majority, who join the market only in period 2.
Within group g (g = 1 2), there is a continuum of consumers; each is indexed by a parameter xg, which is uniformly distributed on 0 mg . Following Rohlfs (2001, p. 209), we assume that an individual's value for the good in question is composed of two parts: One is the generic value, and the other is the magnification of the network size. To facilitate comparison with the literature, we consider the linear form of generic valuation. To simplify the algebra, we further assume that the network effects for both groups are represented by the expected network size. These assumptions yield a specific demand structure as follows. For an early adopter x1, her consumption value in period 1 is A1 - a1x1 n1 1.8 The term in parentheses
8 By construction, individuals in each group are ordered decreasingly in terms of their generic willingness to pay, represented by a decreasing function qg xg = Ag - agxg. This particular ordering enables us to interpret qg xg as an inverse generic demand, and thus facilitates our analysis.

represents the generic part of valuation, while n1 1 is the expected network size in period 1.9 For the same consumer, her consumption value in period 2 will be A1 - a1x1 n1 2 + n2 . Likewise, a group 2 consumer x2 has a consumption value of A2 - a2x2 n1 2 + n2 in period 2.
Following Bulow (1982), we assume that a perfect second-hand market exists.10 This eliminates the possibility of price discrimination. Assuming there is no income effect for any individual, we focus on the equilibrium analysis of the market in the presence of network effects. In the Technical Appendix,11 we discuss extension of our linear model to a more general demand specification.

2.2. Inverted U-Shaped Demands and the Critical Mass
In conventional analysis, a demand function associates any given price with a desired quantity of the commodity. Nonetheless, with network effects, a price might correspond to multiple quantities. To derive the demand correspondences in our model, note that if a consumer indexed xg is willing to buy the object, anyone in the same group with a lower index x < xg will also demand it. Consequently, the total demand in the economy is determined by the marginal consumers.
In period 1 only early adopters appear in the market, and the inverse demand is simply

p1 x = A1 - a1x x

(1)

The diagram in Figure 1(a) illustrates the demand correspondence. For any p < A21/4a1, p associates with three possible equilibria: x = 0 or the roots of the quadratic function A1 -a1x x = p.12 As is well known, the larger root xmax in the downward-sloping part of the parabola is a stable equilibrium (see the appendix
of Rohlfs 2001), so is x = 0. Meanwhile, the smaller
root xmin on the upward slope is an unstable equilibrium. xmin usually represents a critical mass, which the seller has to overcome to reach the stable and more
profitable equilibrium.
In period 2, the product's appeal extends to the
second group. For any price p, let x1 and x2 be

9 Specifically, n1 i = X1 i for i = 1 2, where X1 i  0 m1 is a subset of group 1 and consists of those who are expected to consume the product in period i. In addition, we implicitly assume that an individual with the highest index mg has zero value for consumption, regardless of network sizes, which implies mg = Ag/ag.
10 For instance, Internet marketplaces such as Half.com or Amazon.com allow people to trade used computer software.
11 The Technical Appendix can be found at http://mktsci.pubs. informs.org.
12 Because the network effect is multiplicative, the willingness to pay by any consumer would be zero if he expects no one else to buy the product. Therefore, x = 0 is an equilibrium.

the marginal consumers for groups 1 and 2, respec-
tively. x1 and x2 must satisfy the demand correspondences: p = A1 - a1x1 x1 + x2 and p = A2 - a2x2 · x1 + x2 . Alternatively, one can first derive the aggregate inverse generic demand as q~ x by summing
q1 x = A1 - a1x and q2 x = A2 - a2x horizontally. The aggregate inverse demand is then given by p x =
q~ x x. In Figure 1(b), q~ x is the dashed line, while
p x is the double-hump shaped curve. For x  x1, p x is equal to A1x - a1x2; otherwise,

where the critical value x1  A1 - A2 /a1 is determined by p1 x1 = p x1 . From Figure 1(b), we observe that p x has two humps if and only if A1/2a1 < x1 < A~ /2a~.13 The double-hump shape of demand is simi-
lar to the one drawn in Rohlfs (2001, p. 219), except

13 To be precise, a hump is a local maximum of the p · curve. In Figure 1(ii), p x reaches local maxima A21/4a1 and A~ 2/4a~ at x = A1/2a1 and A~ /2a~, respectively. However, if x1  A1/2a1, p x is increasing  x  0 x1 , and thus has only one local maximum at x = A~ /2a~. The argument for the case with x1  A~ /2a~ is analogous. Note that A1/2a1 < A~ /2a~ = A1/2a1 + A2/2a2.

that we provide a theoretical justification for it here.14 According to Rohlfs (2001) and Shapiro and Varian (1999), the monopolist can penetrate the section of p x beyond x1 in the second period only if the price is set lower than or equal to p^. This is the penetration-pricing constraint referred to in the literature.
Due to the double-hump shape of demand, for any price p between p^  p x1 and A~ 2/4a~, p associates with five equilibria (see the bullets in Figure 1(b)), two (the third and the fifth from the left) of which are stable with positive quantities. In the presence of multiple stable equilibria, the criterion for equilibrium selection proves to be critical in our analysis of a monopolist's market strategy.

2.3. The Penetration-Pricing Constraint and

Equilibrium Selection

It has long been recognized that a market price can

associate with multiple network sizes in equilibrium

(Oren and Smith 1981, Oren et al. 1982, Katz and

Shapiro 1986). Following Katz and Shapiro (1986),

the conventional approach is to select the equilib-

rium that is Pareto-preferred by consumers.15 As

seen from Figure 1(b), this selection criterion implies

a different demand curve faced by the monopolist

lessor so that she can choose to lease any quantity from A~ /2a~ A~ /a~ in period 2. In this paper, however,

we assume that consumers are more conservative in

terms of their expectations of network growth. Con-

sequently, we focus on the stable equilibrium with

the smallest network size for any given price. The

resulting demand corresponding with the price range

p^ A~ 2/4a~ the larger

is x1 x1 root of p1

instead of x = A~ 2/4a~

A~ /2a~ x2 , where x1 is and x2  A2/a~ satisfies

p x2 = p x1 .

One way to justify our criterion for equilibrium

selection is that it validates the dichotomy of pric-

ing strategies when marketing a new product, as pro-

posed by Dean (1976). The first segment of demand

for x  A1/2a1 x1 represents the strategy of skimming pricing with which the monopolist targets the elite

group of consumers; the second segment of demand for x  x2 A~ /a~ corresponds to the strategy of penetration pricing that directs at the general public. In this

paper, we focus on the situation under which pene-

tration pricing dominates skimming pricing.

14 Rohlfs (2001, p. 215) assumed q x = cx and f n = kn. However, this will not generate the inverted-U figure he suggested. For under his specification, p x = q x f x = ckx +1, which (depending on the size of ) is either increasing or decreasing in x. Thus, the willingness to pay by the marginal consumer would be increasing or decreasing in the whole range of x.
15 Other authors such as Oren et al. (1982) simply assumed a singlepeaked willingness-to-pay function, which eliminates the possibility of multiple equilibria.

3. Dynamic Pricing: A Numerical

Example

In this section, we consider a specific set of param-

eters and demonstrate that selling is more profitable

than leasing under this particular demand specifica-

tion. Let xil be the quantity produced by the monopolist lessor up to the ith period, and xiS the quantity produced by the monopolist seller up to the ith

period.16

gies yield a profit below 9 12 for leasing the prod-

uct, which is lower than the 9 23 yield from selling it.

Below we explain this.

If the monopolist wants to lease the product, she

maximizes l = p1 x1l · x1l + p x2l · x2l by choosing x1l

and x2l. It is readily verified that the first-best prices

and

p2 =

Nonetheless,

Now consider the selling strategy. The monopo-

list's second-period strategy is still restricted by the

need to penetrate the market. However, being able

ates the constraint for the seller. In our example, if

4. The General Analysis
The previous section shows that leasing might be less profitable than selling. In this section, we identify the general conditions under which the comparison holds true. To highlight the implications from imposing the penetration-pricing constraint, we start with the benchmark case where the monopolist is not bounded by the constraint.

4.1. The Case Without Penetration-Pricing Constraints
An important characteristic that sets our model apart is the assumption of a growing market. In this subsection we show that this property alone does not lead to our findings. Without the penetration-pricing constraint, the analysis and conclusion are similar to those in Bulow (1982), even though the latter assumes an identical market in both periods.
The monopolist lessor's aggregate profits are l = p1 x1l - c · x1l + p x2l · x2l - c · x2l - x1l , where c is the marginal cost of production.17 Let MR1 x1  p1 x1 + p1 x1 · x1 and MR2 x2  p x2 + p x2 · x2 be the marginal revenues for period-1 and aggregate production, respectively. The first-order conditions can then be written as MR1 x1l = 0 and MR2 x2l = c. Solving these equations yields the interior solution as follows:

x2l

(3)

For (3) to solve the monopolist lessor's problem, we need the following regularity assumptions:
Assumption 1. c < A~ 2/4a~.

Assumption 2. l x1l x2l > maxx 2p1 x - c · x.

16 We adopt the notations so that x2l or x2S represents the total number of units on the period 2 market. Period 2 production is therefore
x2j - x1j for j = l or S.

17 It is possible that x2l < x1l, in which case the last term shall be zero. Nonetheless, one can show that x2l > x1l in equilibrium, and thus we adopt the current formulation for simplicity.

1017

Assumption A~ /2a~ or p x2l

1 is equivalent to requiring either x2l > > c. Therefore, the assumption guar-

antees that x2l lies on the downward sloped part of

p x and yields positive profits. Throughout the paper,

we assume that Assumption 1 always holds. Note

that the monopolist has a simple strategy, where she

ignores group-2 consumers in period 2 and focuses

on leasing to group 1 in both periods. Assumption 2

ensures that this alternative strategy is less profitable

than x1l x2l .18

Proposition 1. Suppose the growth of market is sig-
nificant for the lessor in the sense of Assumption 2. Then, x1l x2l in (3) maximizes the monopoly lessor's profits in the absence of penetration-pricing constraints.

We now consider the seller's problem. Let x2 x1S  arg maxx2S p x2S - c x2S - x1S be the solution to the second-stage optimization problem. Realizing her
own choice in period 1 restricts her action in period 2,
the seller's problem is to maximize S = p1 x1S + p x2 x1S - c x1S + p x2S - c x2S - x1S . Let x1S x2S denote the solution. The maximization program is dif-
ferent from that in the leasing scenario in the term p x2 x1S , which represents the consumers' rational expectation. The first-order conditions are

MR1 x1S

=-

p x2 x1S x1S

x1S

(4)

MR2 x2S = c + p x2S x1S

The next assumption parallels Assumption 2. It ensures that the monopolist finds it more profitable selling to group-2 consumers, which implies that the solution to (4) attains the optimum.

Assumption 3. The profits attained by the solution
to (4) are higher than those attained by maximizing S while excluding group-2 consumers.

The mathematical expression for Assumption 3 is
not provided here. Essentially, it requires either a
high A2 (high willingness to pay) or a low a2 (a large population).

Proposition 2. Suppose the growth of market is significant for the seller in the sense of Assumption 3. The solution to (4) maximizes the monopolist seller's profits in the absence of penetration-pricing constraints.

18 In the absence of a growing market, the right-hand side represents the lessor's profits attained by leasing the same amount of product in both periods. Intuitively, Assumption 2 holds when the addition of group-2 consumers contributes significantly to the monopolist's profits. Roughly speaking, it is true when either their willingness to pay is high enough (A2 is high), or the population is large enough (A2/a2 is high). We discuss such specific conditions in the Technical Appendix, found at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org.

It is straightforward to compare the equilibrium profits: the strategy x1S x2S is accessible to the lessor, and thus her maximal profits must be weakly higher. The details for comparing the equilibrium quantities can be found in the Technical Appendix (at http:// mktsci.pubs.informs.org). The next proposition summarizes our findings. It is important to emphasize that these findings are consistent with Bulow's (1982).
Proposition 3. Suppose the growth of market is significant so that Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. In the absence of penetration-pricing constraints, the seller produces less than the lessor does in period 1, but the seller's total quantity in period 2 is higher; that is, x1S < x1l and x2S > x2l. Moreover, leasing is more profitable than selling.

4.2. The Case with a Penetration-Pricing

Constraint

The monopolist's pricing strategy will be much dif-

ferent when she takes into account the penetration-

pricing constraint. We start by reiterating some

notations illustrated in Figure 1(b): x1  A1 - A2 /a1 is the critical value at which p1 x1 = p x1 ; while x2  A2/a~ leads to the same critical price with p x2 = p x1 . For the monopolist lessor, the range for feasible x2ls is A1/2a1 x1  x2 A~ /a~ . In other words, the lessor cannot penetrate the period-2 market unless the

price is lower than p^  p1 x1 .19 Therefore, the lessor's

problem is to maximize l = p1 x1l + p x2l - c ·

x1l + p x2l - x2 A~ /a~ . Let

c

the seller has two options in the next period: She can

either charge a high price p2  p^ that appeals only to group-1 consumers, or a low price p2 < p^ that reaches group-2 consumers. These options correspond to the intervals x1S x1 and x2 A~ /a~ , respectively. On the contrary, if x1S is greater than x1, the seller has built a customer base large enough to penetrate the

market in period 2, so that she can select any x2S from A~ /2a~ A~ /a~ . The penetration-pricing constraint has no

effect in this case. For the constraint to be binding in

equilibrium, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 6. x1l < x1 x2 x1 < x2.

Given the time-consistency constraint, for any x1S,
the seller maximizes p x2S - c x2S - x1S subject
to the penetration-pricing constraint corresponding to x1S. Let x2p x1S be the solution to the seller's constrained problem in period 2. Along with Proposi-
tion 3 (x1S < x1l), the first part of Assumption 6 implies that x1S < x1. Because we know that x2 · is an increasing function, the second part implies x2 x1S < x2  x1S < x1. As such, one concludes that the unconstrained solution x2S =x2 x1S in §4.1 is lower than x2. In short, Assumptions 6 implies a binding penetration-pricing constraint so that x1S x2S is not achievable.
x2p x1S can now be derived as follows. For x1S < x1, xxathb22pelxxei11ntSSote.=prGieoxinrv2eestxonr1alSutxet2piootxhnr1eSxm,2xtax2hr.12ekS0estiFesiolnlnreoprxt'es1arSicoohpditexi2vm1,,aaibztnlhaedet,ioaxsnn2pedlxple1trSrhoub=isslem is

Proposition 5. Suppose the market is growing and the penetration-pricing constraint is binding for the seller (Assumptions 5 and 6). The monopolist's optimal selling strategy, x1pS x2pS , is either x1l x2 or x1 x2 x1 .
When comparing x1l x2 and x1 x2 x1 , the seller trades off her profits in two periods. In the former strategy, the seller is bounded in period 2 by the penetration-pricing constraint, but she is able to maximize her period-1 profits. In the latter strategy, the seller sacrifices her period-1 profits to penetrate the market and capture bigger gains in period 2. If the period-2 market is lucrative enough, as we assume in this paper, the latter strategy will be optimal.
From Proposition 5, we observe that the leasing solution x1l x2 is feasible in the selling regime. It follows immediately that leasing is no longer more profitable than selling. The leasing profits are reduced because the lessor has to lower the period-2 price to reach group-2 consumers. In contrast, the seller's loss occurs mostly in period 1. Thus, the constraint affects the lessor's and the seller's profits differently.

Corollary 6. Following Proposition 5, one obtains

p l



p S

in

equilibrium.

Therefore,

selling

is

more

profitable

than leasing under the penetration-pricing constraint.

The inequality in the corollary holds strictly when A2 is large enough or a2 is small enough. Recall that A2/2 is the average willingness to pay by group-2 consumers, and A2/a2 characterizes the size of population. Therefore, Corollary 6 implies that when the monopolist expects a significant growth of the market, she will prefer selling rather than leasing the product.
Our analysis used a particular form of demand specification. In addition, we also made certain regularity assumptions to ensure that penetration-pricing constraints are binding. It can be shown that these presumptions do not place severe restrictions on our findings. A detailed mathematical analysis of these assumptions can be found in the Technical Appendix, found at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org.

5. Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we study the pricing dynamics of a monopolist who produces durable goods with network effects. We demonstrate that introductory pricing constitutes the monopolist seller's optimal strategy and that selling might be more profitable than leasing under certain market conditions.

Our analysis relies on the specific criterion of equilibrium selection. That is, in face of multiple equilibria, we select the stable equilibrium that yields the smallest network size for any given price. This criterion presumes that consumers are generally cautious about the prospect of network growth. Such presumption is plausible in reality if, for instance, the product/technology is novel and unfamiliar, or the firm is relatively unknown so that its success is in doubt. In contrast, for a product like iPod by Apple, Inc., a potential consumer will likely anticipate a very optimistic growth of its user network. Our criterion will hence be inapplicable in the latter scenario.
This finding helps us to interpret the relative advantage of seller over lessor as predicated in our model, a result different from that of Bulow (1982). The advantage of the seller derives from her ability to establish a large installed base of committed users. In contrast, the lessor cannot demand renters commit to continuous renting because in each period the renters will always make independent leasing decisions. The seller's strategic flexibility thus leads to higher profits. Note, however, that our conclusion conflicts with past findings. Future empirical tests are needed to determine the correct theory.
