Statement from the Editor Regarding "`Counting Your Customers' One by One:
A Hierarchical Bayes Extension to the Pareto/NBD Model"

In the original version of the paper " `Counting Your Customers' One by One: A Hierarchical Bayes Extension to the Pareto/NBD Model" by Makoto Abe (Marketing Science, Articles in Advance, June 23, 2008, DOI:
10.1287/mksc.1090.0502), an error in Step [2b] of the data augmentation scheme exists and was detected by
Siddharth S. Singh, Sharad Borle, and Dipak C. Jain.
In particular, when drawing yi, one needs to condition on zi, i, as well as i. In the scheme implemented by Abe (2008), this conditioning of the yi draw on i is missing. Although the author does write in his Step [2b] "generate {yi zi, i, i}," i.e., yi is to be drawn conditional on zi, i, and i, however, as is clear from the explanation provided by the author (§3.4 of this article), his drawing of yi was not done conditional on i. This will lead to an incorrect data augmentation procedure, which in turn will result in incorrect parameter
estimates. Consequently, the original paper by Abe has been replaced by a new version (Marketing Science 28(3)
541­553) and addresses other important issues not addressed in the original Abe paper.
