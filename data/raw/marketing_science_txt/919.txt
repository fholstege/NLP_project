The paper "Manufacturer's Returns Policies and Retail Competition" by Padmanabhan and Png (1997) argues that returns policies intensify retail competition and therefore raise the manufacturer's profits. They reach that result through a problematic method to solve the game. Particularly, in the game where the manufacturer accepts returns, they unreasonably assume the retailers would never face stock constraints, thus changing the retail competition from a Cournot-like competition to a Bertrand one. Actually, in a game where retailers first order stocks and then compete by choosing prices, even if a manufacturer offers full return policies, the retailers can still use "insufficient" stocks as quantities precommitment in order to uphold retail prices. Hence, the retailers still face stock constraints at the final stage of the game. The nature of the game is essentially unaffected by returns policies when demand is certain. This note shows that returns policies do not intensify retail competition in the model proposed by Padmanabhan and Png (1997).

1. The Paper
In this note we will discuss the paper "Manufacturer's Returns Policies and Retail Competition" by Padmanabhan and Png (1997)--PP hereafter-- published in Marketing Science. PP consider a market where a monopoly upstream manufacturer sells through one or two downstream retailers. The product has limited shelf life. The retailers face linear demand curves. On pages 83­84, the paper defines a three-stage game:
1. The manufacturer sets distribution policy, which includes a uniform wholesale price and possibly a returns policy; 2. Given the manufacturer's distribution policy, the retailer(s) decide how much stock to order; 3. With stocks in hand, the retailer(s) set prices to the final consumers.
The central points of the paper can be summarized as follows. It first considers a benchmark where there is a single retailer. It is shown that a returns policy makes no difference in that case. Then the paper studies the case with two competing retailers. It finds a returns policy that intensifies the downstream competition, therefore leading to higher profits for the manufacturer. Notations include marginal production cost c, wholesale price w, retail price p, and retail stock s. Demand functions: q = - p for the monopoly retailer, and q1 = - p1 + p2, q2 =
- p2 + p1 > for the duopoly retailers.

2. Returns Policies and Retail Competition
Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) study a two-stage oligopoly game. In that game, competing firms first simultaneously choose production quantities. After the production levels are made public, there is price competition. Under certain conditions, they show that the unique equilibrium outcome is the Cournot outcome. The game proposed by PP actually fits the Kreps and Scheinkman model perfectly, except now we have a three-stage game where two competing retailers order stocks from an upstream manufacturer. Retail stocks are chosen at the second stage, and retail prices are chosen at the third stage. The question is whether a returns policy at the third stage affects the nature of the game. PP claim that in the game with returns, the retailers should always order sufficient stocks at the second stage, such that they never face stock constraints at the third stage. This means the game with a returns policy is no longer a Cournot-like game, but a Bertrand game, because the only effective decision of the retailers is choosing prices. This belief is not reasonable, because it deprives the retailers of the right to choose optimal stocks at the second stage. In fact, it is still in the retailers' interest to use stocks as quantities precommitment in order to uphold prices at the third stage. For example, suppose both retailers provide exactly identical services

to consumers. According to PP, the downstream price competition should result in competitive outcome, which means zero profits for both retailers. However, if either retailer ordered stock less than the competitive level at the second stage, both retailers would make positive profits. Hence, ordering "insufficient" stock makes the retailers better off.
In the game with returns, PP find the "equilibrium" wholesale price

and minimal retail stocks

Assuming that the retailers do not order excess stocks, PP find the manufacturer makes more profit with returns. This result is incorrect because of the problematic method used. The following two claims represent the finding of this research note. Claim 1 shows that the "equilibrium" found by PP is not an equilibrium. Claim 2 shows that returns policies make no difference in equilibrium.
Claim 1. Starting from stocks s1  s1 and s2  s2 = s1 at the second stage, if either retailer instead orders stock s1 - , where > 0 is sufficiently small, she would make more profits.
Proof. First we assume s1 = s2 = s1 = s2. Now suppose Retailer 1 deviates to s1 = s1 - . While PP's "equilibrium" prices p1, p2 now lead to a shortage, the retailers should charge higher retail prices that clear the market.1 The retail prices satisfy - p1 + p2 = s1 = s1 - and - p2 + p1 = s2. From them we can work out the retail price p1 = p1 + / 2 - 2 . Therefore, Retailer 1's profit after the deviation is

1 = s1 p1 -w = s1 -

c > 0, which is assumed in the model.2 Thus the

deviation makes Retailer 1 better off.

Now we show that if s1 > s1 and s2 > s1, deviating to s1 = s1 - makes Retailer 1 better off. Assuming is sufficiently small, Retailer 1 would face stock con-

straint, but Retailer 2 would not. Retailer 2 solves:

, whose second-order w = 0, together with

- p1 + p2 = s1 - , we get p1 = p1 + 2 / 2 2 - 2 .

Therefore, Retailer 1's profit after the deviation is:

ity holds if and only if - c + c > 0, which

is assumed. It is easy to see that other situations

(s1 > s1 and s2 = s1, or, s1 = s1 and s2 > s1 are not troubling.

Claim 2. In the game with returns, the equilibrium is the same as that without returns.

Proof. Please see the Appendix. Claim 2 shows that the retailers still play a Cournotlike game, but not a Bertrand game. That means the retailers still use stocks as quantities precommitment even if the manufacturer accepts returns. Particularly, they never order excess stocks.

3. Conclusion
The paper by PP (1997) claims that returns policies intensify retail competition. This result cannot be reached if the model is solved correctly. The paper unreasonably assumes that the retailers never face stock constraints when they are offered returns policies. As Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) demonstrate, firms can use quantity precommitment to achieve a Cournot-like outcome, even if they engage in price competition at the final stage of the game. A returns policy cannot change this story, particularly when demand is certain. Due to the problematic method used to solve the model, PP (1997) incorrectly alters the game with returns from a Cournotlike game to a Bertrand game. Singh and Vives (1984)

2 Actually PP do not explicitly assume - c + c > 0, but this condition is required for the model to make sense. Otherwise, even if both retailers charge prices equal to the marginal production cost c, the total quantity demand is still nonpositive. Thus, the equilibrium would be trivial.

show that in a differentiated duopoly, price competition is more intense than quantity competition, provided the goods are substitutes. If the game with returns were treated as a Bertrand game, we would observe more-intense retail competition, which leads to higher upstream profit. PP (1997) provides empirical evidence that returns policies narrow retail margins, but the implication of this note is that we cannot attribute that to intensified retail competition. The demand uncertainty theories (Marvel and Peck 1995) might explain that better.

Appendix Proof of Claim 2. Suppose the equilibrium retail stocks
are s1, s2. If both retailers always order excess stocks at the second stage, the outcome would be that which PP find, which is not an equilibrium as Claim 1 shows. If one retailer orders excess stock but the other does not, which means we would have an asymmetric equilibrium, one can show this is impossible because the retailer who orders excess stock can do better by ordering a little bit less than her actual sale. We omit the detail here. If neither retailer orders excess stock, the retail prices must satisfy - p1 + p2 = s1 and
- p2 + p1 = s2. Solving this equation system, we have

p1 =

s1 + 2-

p2 =

At the second stage, the retailers choose s1 s2 to maximize their profits:

1 = s1 p1 - w = s1

and

2 = s2 p2 - w = s2

The first-order conditions are

s2

From this equation system we obtain

s1 = s2 =

+ -w 2 -r2 2+

At the first stage, the manufacturer chooses wholesale

price w to maximize its profit = w - c s1 + s2 . Substituting (2) into and solving the problem, we get wholesale

This retail sale and price configuration is feasible, and hence is the unique equilibrium of the game. Referring to Table 2 on page 86 of Png (1997), we see the equilibrium is the same as that without returns.3
