Abstract. Although firms are leveraging weather conditions in promotions, they struggle to quantify the impact. This study exploits field experiment data on weather-based mobile promotions with over six million users. Results find that sunny and rainy weather have first-order main effects. Purchase responses to promotions are higher and faster in sunny weather relative to cloudy weather, whereas purchase responses to promotions are lower and slower in rainy weather. These findings are robust across different measures of weather changes with both backward-looking historical weather and forward-looking forecasts, as well as deviations from normal weather. Also, sunny and rainy weather have second-order interactive effects with ad copies of mobile promotions. Compared with the neutral ad copy, the prevention frame ad copy hurts the initial promotion boost induced by sunshine, but improves the initial promotion drop induced by rainfall. For marketers, these findings imply new opportunities in customer data analytics for more effective weather-based mobile targeting.

1. Introduction
Many firms are leveraging weather-based promotions. For example, Burberry rolls out weather-based campaigns promoting products according to London's local weather.1 Echoing this, Ace Hardware, Taco Bell, Delta Airlines, Farmers Insurance, and others target local weather in their promotions (Rosman 2013). With more than 150 million users of weather apps, there are a total of 2 billion checks of weather each day (Suddath 2014). Thus, over 200 major brands have committed substantial marketing budget to partner with the Weather Channel Company for advertising and promotions (Neff 2014).
However, firms struggle to scientifically quantify the impact of weather on purchase responses to promotions. This difficulty arises mainly because of data limitations. Under traditional promotion settings, it is difficult to compile an observational data set that can simultaneously track individual users' weather, location, and purchase response to promotions. Even with observational data, self-selection and endogeneity may confound estimates from simple correlational

approaches. Thus, it is necessary to use an experimental approach to gauge the impact (Sudhir 2016, Gordon et al. 2016).
To overcome this difficulty, we exploit mobile promotions with field experiments. Mobile technologies allow for more precisely identifying individuals' location, weather, and forecast, and digital records on the incident and timing of purchase responses. Furthermore, through field experiments, we randomly assigned different ad copies of mobile promotions. This manipulation generated an exogenous shock and helped gauge the causal impact. We collaborated with a major telecom company who conducted field experiments on over six million mobile users.
Results indicate that purchase responses to promotions are higher and faster in sunny weather, but lower and slower in rainfall, relative to cloudy weather. Better-than-yesterday weather and better-than-forecast weather engender more purchase responses, and vice versa. A good deviation from the expected rainy or cloudy weather with relatively rare events of sunshine would boost purchase responses to mobile promo-

tions.2 These effects are incremental and robust even after controlling for individual location, time of day, temperature, humidity, visibility, air pressure, dew point, wind, and mobile usage behavior.
Besides such first-order main effects, sunny and rainy weather also have second-order interaction effects with ad copies of mobile promotions. An ad copy with a prevention frame ("do not miss the opportunity to take advantage of this special deal") is more effective in rainfall, yet a neutral frame ad copy ("a general greeting of dear respected customers") is more effective under sunshine; that is, compared against the neutral ad copy, a prevention frame ad copy hurts the initial promotion boost induced by sunny weather, but improves the initial promotion drop induced by rainy weather. To enhance the generalizability in results, we obtained an additional field data set that involved app ads of a different product from the telecom company. The additional data set consistently supported the positive effect of sunny weather and negative rainy weather on incremental mobile ad sales compared with the cloudy weather condition.
Our findings make several contributions. First, they help reveal the effectiveness of a novel approach with weather-based advertising and promotions. Consumers nowadays are inundated with and annoyed by irrelevant ads on their personal devices (Tucker 2014, Bart et al. 2014, Andrews et al. 2016). Our findings suggest that an effective approach is to leverage the relevant, local weather information. Sunny and rainy weather may be viable, costless instruments to boost the sales returns to promotions. Firms should use the prevention frame ad copy on rainy days and the simple neutral frame ad copy on sunny days for more incremental promotion purchases. Thus, weather-based promotions with the appropriate ad copy may attain greater "bang for the buck."
Furthermore, our findings extend prior mobile targeting literature that has focused on location, time, and crowdedness in the environment (Danaher et al. 2015, Ghose et al. 2012, Luo et al. 2014, Fong et al. 2015, Dubé et al. 2017). This is the first study to examine sunny and rainy weather as contextual variables for mobile targeting. Indeed, weather and mobile devices go hand in hand, as checking weather forecasts is one of the most used native applications. Enabled by ubiquitous mobile location technologies and universal accessibility of forecasts on apps, brands may leverage weather conditions for designing promotions and ad copy creatives. Sunny and rainy weather are largely neglected environmental variables in promotions literature in general, and mobile targeting literature in particular.
More broadly speaking, they illustrate the potency of behavioral field study and big data to help tease out the subtle weather effects that would be hard to detect with small samples. Indeed, quantitative researchers may

763
examine how "behavioral message frames based on psychological theories that have been tested in the lab can be leveraged in the field" (Sudhir 2016, p. 5). Similar to the work that uses behavioral theories of sympathy bias to test the effects of advertising content on charitable giving (Sudhir et al. 2016), our study leverages psychological theories of weather and consumer behavior to quantify mobile promotion effectiveness. For marketers, our findings imply fresh opportunities of customer data analytics for effective weather-based mobile targeting.
2. Literature and Hypotheses
Although the marketing literature has hardly investigated the specific role of weather for responses to promotions, prior works in psychology and economics have discussed the general role of weather (Steele 1951, Simonsohn 2007). Weather affects people's mood states, shopping activities, and other daily behaviors. Persinger and Levesque (1983) found that weather accounted for 40% of the variability in people's daily moods. Exposure to sunlight enables the brain to produce more serotonin and thus improves mood like in a "heliotherapy" (Schwarz and Clore 1983). With a better mood, people have more positive evaluations of restaurant services, investments, life satisfaction, products, and shopping activities (Murray et al. 2010). A good mood induced by sunny weather positively influences stock valuation, and hence investors buy more stocks on sunny days (Hirshleifer and Shumway 2003). Similarly, because of positive projection bias, consumers tend to purchase more convertible cars in sunny weather with clear skies (Busse et al. 2015).
By contrast, rainy weather likely creates negative feelings (Klimstra et al. 2011). Exposure to rain can leave individuals wet and uncomfortable and in a lousy mood state (Conlin et al. 2007, Parsons 2001, Zwebner et al. 2014). In a comprehensive meta-analysis, Hsiang et al. (2013) find that people experience more depressive symptoms and negative feelings such as anxiety, nervousness, stress, and fear on rainy days. Also, Rosman (2013) documents that weather app users are in bad moods in rainy and inclement weather such as storms and hurricanes. By contrast, people experience better moods during bright sunny days. Thus, extant literature ties not only sunlight to positive moods but also rainy weather to negative feelings.
The central hypothesis here is that purchase responses to mobile promotions are higher and faster in sunny weather, but lower and slower in rainy weather, relative to a cloudy sky. This claim is consistent with the psychological theory of "affect as information" (Schwarz and Clore 1983, Pham 2009, Pham et al. 2012). Specifically, mood can be an information input to evaluate advertising (Batra and Stayman 1990) and price promotions (Hsu and Liu 1998). People evaluate the

764

Li et al.: Sunny, Rainy, and Cloudy with a Chance of Mobile Promotion Marketing Science, 2017, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 762­779, © 2017 INFORMS

same product more favorably when in a good mood, and less favorably when in a bad mood (Stephen and Pham 2008; for reviews, see Isen 2001, Gardner 1985). Also, a state of high affect can lead to more favorable outcomes because consumers are more innovative and prone to variety seeking (Kahn and Isen 1993), so consumers in a better mood are more open to information advertising and promotional discounts. This discussion suggests that, compared to cloudy weather, sunny weather with more exposure to sunlight would enable the brain to produce more serotonin and a better mood, which would then lead to more favorable and spontaneous evaluations of ads and deals, and thus more and faster purchase responses. By contrast, rainy weather would lead to a worse mood state, and thus less favorable evaluations with fewer and slower responses to promotions.
Another hypothesis in our study is that sunny and rainy weather have interaction effects with ad copies of mobile promotions. A prevention frame ad copy hurts the initial promotion boost induced by sunshine, but improves the initial promotion drop induced by rainfall. This claim is also consistent with the theory of affect as information, which holds that feeling interpretations are subject to a response-mapping dependency (Pham 2009, p. 178). People in good moods pay more attention to nonnegative information in messages. This is because people in good mood states generally try not to expose themselves to negative information, hoping that they can remain blissful (Isen 2001). On the other hand, people in bad moods pay more attention to negativity in messages because they are more vigilant and psychologically more available for such messages (Mayer et al. 1992, Schwarz and Clore 1983). Indeed, Pham and Avnet (2009) find that the effects of positive mood are attenuated by a prevention frame because positive mood mismatches the negativity in loss-avoidance prevention frame. Consistent with this, the ad copy with a prevention frame attenuates the initial promotion boost induced by sunshine, because sunny-weather-induced positive mood mismatches the negative information in a prevention frame. Reversely, because rainy-weather-induced negative mood matches the negative information, the ad copy with a prevention frame improves the initial promotion drop induced by rainfall.
3. Field Data
Our field experiment data were provided by a large mobile telecommunications company. The ideal test of weather effects is to conduct a randomized field experiment by manipulating weather. Yet, random assignments of sunny and rainy weather are impossible. However, we can randomly assign different ad copies of promotions and then match the data with weather records, i.e., augmented field data. Thus, we conducted

a quasi field experiment to explore the effect of sunny and rainy weather on purchase responses to mobile promotions. The mobile campaigns promote the addon service of video streaming to smartphone users. The basic mobile services, such as call service and short message service (SMS), are provided by the telecom company when users subscribe to specific cell phone plans. However, the add-on services must be purchased. This promoted product allows mobile users to watch videos on their smartphone devices on the go. Randomized promotions were sent to over six million (6,744,884) mobile users via push-open SMS notification campaigns from September 2, 2013, through October 3, 2013. The mobile promotions had two ad copies: one with a prevention frame and one with a neutral frame. For the prevention frame ad copy, the message began with "Do not miss the opportunity to take advantage of this special deal!" This ad copy emphasized preventing the users from losing the deal, i.e., a negative tone with the wording of not missing in ad copy. For the neutral frame ad copy, the message began with a general greeting of "Dear respected customer." This ad copy emphasized a generic salutation, a nonnegative tone in ad message.3 Variations in message length could be a confound, given the small screen sizes of mobile phones. Yet the original messages of the two ad copies in Chinese had similar length (see Appendix A for message length). The rest of the promotion content was the same: "Subscribe to the mobile video-streaming service of [the Wireless Service Provider] for only ¥3 per month! Watch video episodes of the most popular TV series on your mobile devices on-the-go! The regular price is ¥6. Purchase by replying "Yes" to this SMS within the next 48 hours!" All these campaigns were promoting the same mobile product with the same price, and all SMS messages were sent to users at 9 . . every day consistently. Interested users could respond by purchasing the service with promoted prices. The purchase prices would be charged immediately to the users' wireless phone bill. All SMS campaigns were randomly sent. For the randomization procedures, the SAS software's random number generator and RANUNI function were used to generate a random value from a uniform distribution. After that, the random numbers were sorted in sequence to extract the sample to send to mobile users. The targeted users did not subscribe to this videostreaming service, nor did they receive a similar mobile promotion from the wireless service provider.
To identify the incremental effect, there were 20,000 similar users in the control group who did not receive any promotions during our field experiment time window.4 These users are regarded as the holdout baseline group. Also, tests of descriptive statistics with covariates (weather, location, mobile usage behavior) find

insignificant differences across the three groups (prevention frame, neutral frame, and holdout group; all p > 0.18), thus passing the randomization checks and supporting that the control groups are indeed suitable and represent what the treatment groups would have done had they not been treated.
We complement the promotion data with data from a rich database of weather variables across cities of mobile users at both daily and hourly levels. We develop an algorithm to automate the data scraping process to collect the weather data online from Weather Underground. In this study, we focus on the effects of sunny weather (all sunny and partial sunny), cloudy weather (cloudy days without much sunlight or clear sky), and rainy weather (scattered showers, light rain, rain, heavy rain, and storms). Figure 1 presents the frequency of individual daily exposure to the distribution of weather conditions. As shown in Figure 1, there are enough variations, since, for instance, "sunny" has over 1.3 million observations and "cloudy" has over 3.2 million observations.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict model free evidence for the incremental effect of mobile promotions. The purchase rate of the holdout group (without promotion) is zero. This is reasonable because the mobile company provides over 200 add-on mobile service packages. It is quite difficult for users to notice the video-stream service package without promotions. Thus, the promotion responses are incremental, and the control group is not included in the subsequent model tests. This also supports that the responses are not due simply to more mobile usage on sunny days. Figure 2(b) suggests that the purchase response rate is the highest (1.05%) for sunny weather, and the lowest (0.64%) for rainy weather. The baseline cloudy weather (0.78%) has a response rate in between.

3.1. Data Analyses and Identification Strategies Our data analyses have multifaceted identification strategies. First, we take self-selection into account since people may self-select the geographic locations to live in. Locations with certain latitude and longitude measures are naturally correlated with weather conditions. Thus, it may not be weather, but rather locations or the types of residents at these locations that drive purchase responses. To deal with this confound, our model controls for location fixed effects of 31 provinces covering 344 cities (see the online appendix). Also, we exploit the within-person weather variations in terms of both backward-looking historical weather and forward-looking forecasts. We further test deviations from the normal weather given the geographical area, since each geographical area has normally expected weather. Then, we conduct a falsification test on the interactions with temperature. Finally, we replicate the main effects of sunshine and rain with a different mobile product through app ads.

4. Analysis and Results
Our econometric models start from the most basic analyses. We estimate individual user's likelihoodi to respond to a mobile promotion by making a purchase. The latent likelihood is a logit function of weather conditions and covariates

Ad Copy Framei equals 1 for the prevention frame ad copy and 0 for the neutral frame ad copy of the mobile promotion. We control for weather-related variables of highest temperature, temperature range, humidity, dew point, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. Correlations among variables are not high, with the largest correlation being less than 0.15 in the data. We control for temperature variables because prior studies have found that temperature has a significant effect on consumer behavior (Conlin et al. 2007), i.e., temperature premium (Zwebner et al. 2014). Temperature range equals the highest temperature minus the lowest temperature in degrees Celsius, indicating the uncertainty of temperature. Also, we control for wind variables because they influence people's moods and feelings (Denissen et al. 2008) and the behavior of animals (Hayes and Huntly 2005). We control for location-

Notes. Mobile Promotion Response is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the user purchased the mobile promotion and 0 otherwise. Sunny is equal to 1 if the weather was sunny on the day that individual i was exposed to the mobile ads and 0 otherwise. Rainy is equal to 1 if the weather was rainy on the day that individual i was exposed to the mobile ads and 0 otherwise. The weather condition is the baseline cloudy weather. Ad Copy Frame is equal to 1 for the mobile promotion with prevention frame ad copy, and 0 for neutral frame ad copy. Wind Speed (kilometers per hour), Temperature (highest, in degrees Celsius), Temperature Range (highest minus lowest), Visibility (in kilometers), Dew Point (in degrees Celsius), Humidity (in percentage), and Air Pressure (in hectopascals) are continuous variables. Rural is a dummy variable for rural or urban area, and there are nine dummies for wind direction. There are 31 provinces and 23 weekdays in the field data.

based fixed effects with R(i), a vector of 30 geographical dummies (31 provinces). Also, we control for rural, which equals 1 if the user lives in a rural area and 0 otherwise. This helps control for income differences between rural and nonrural areas. Finally, we consider the behavioral differences between weekdays and weekends. On weekends, people may have more freedom to choose to go out if it is sunny and stay inside if it is rainy. Yet, on weekdays, people may have less freedom to do so if they need to go to work whether it is sunny or rainy. Relatedly, we consider the confounding day effect. As our field experiment is implemented for one month, people may purchase more at the beginning (versus the end) of one month because of budget limitations. Hence, we control for the day fixed effect with Xi, a vector of day fixed effects (22 dummies for the 23 weekdays) during the promotion period.5 Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the data. The mean value of consumer responses shows the purchase rate is about 0.78%. This purchase rate is consistent with the rate between 0.6% and 2% for mobile promotions in Asia (eMarketer 2014).
As Table 2 shows, across all models, sunny weather consistently has a significant and positive effect, while rainy weather has a negative effect on purchase likelihood. Thus, there is an increase in consumers' likeli-

hood to respond to promotions in sunny weather and a decrease in rainy weather, compared with the baseline cloudy weather. Table 2 also supports the effect of ad copy frame. Compared with the neutral ad copy, the prevention frame ad copy has a positive direct effect on purchase response, as expected.
Besides statistical significance, there is material economic significance. Specifically, in terms of the odds ratio, sunny weather leads to 1.21 ( e0.1880) times more purchases of promotions compared with cloudy weather. By contrast, rainy weather leads to 0.9 ( e-0.1068) times fewer purchases. As the company who conducts field experiments has over 300 million smartphone users, scaling up would produce a substantial amount of sales revenue. Even for firms with a small number of customers, 1.21 times more pur-

chase responses per individual in sunny weather is still meaningful and economically profitable, because firms incur no costs for sunshine but could attain more purchase responses to promotions on sunny days.

Notes. This table reports the logistic regression coefficients, Model (4) is with robust standard error in estimation.

the prevention frame leads to an increased purchase likelihood. Because it is difficult to interpret interactions in logistic regression, we follow the procedure by Ai and Norton (2003, p. 124) to calculate mean marginal effects of the interaction effects. As shown in Figure 3, compared with the neutral ad copy, the prevention ad copy indeed has a lower mean marginal effect in sunny weather. The reverse is observed in rainy weather, where the prevention ad copy has a higher mean marginal effect than the neutral ad copy.
Now, we conduct hour-by-hour survival analyses of response hazard, or purchase speed. The time stamps

in digital purchase records before deal expiration allow us to test how fast consumers purchase at the hourly level. Also, as the weather condition may change every hour, we collect weather data at the hourly level and develop an hour-by-hour hazard model. Table 4 indicates that the promotion purchase rate is the highest (0.00022) in hourly sunny weather and the lowest (0.00013) in hourly rainy weather, thus adding more evidence for our main conclusion even at the hourly level. The Kaplan­Meier plot in Figure 4 suggests that the slope of the line for sunny weather is steeper than that for cloudy weather, meaning that in sunny

Notes. For the prevention frame ad copy, the mobile promotion message begins with "Do not miss the opportunity to take advantage of this special deal!" This ad copy emphasizes preventing the users from losing the deal, i.e., a negative tone with wording about not missing out in the ad copy. For the neutral frame ad copy, the mobile promotion message begins with a general greeting of "Dear respected customer." This ad copy emphasizes a generic salutation, a nonnegative tone in ad message content.

weather, consumers make faster purchase responses to promotions. Also, the slope of the line for cloudy weather is steeper than that for rainy weather, suggesting that consumers have slower purchase responses in rainy weather if they make purchases. However, the Kaplan­Meier plot presumes time-invariant weather, assuming that what matters is the weather at the time of receiving the deal. Thus, we also conduct hour-byhour analyses with hazard model in a panel style with time-varying weather. Hazard analyses account for the weather at the time of receiving the deal and at the time of purchasing it.

The proportional hazard model is shown below

Uiwt eather

h(t) h0(t) exp(Uiwt eather), 0 + 1HourlySunnyit + 2HourlyRainyit + Ad Copy Framei + 1Ad Copy Framei × HourlySunnyi + 2Ad Copy Framei × HourlyRainyi + ControlVars + µR(i) + Xi + it , (3)

where the dependent variable is h(t), the hazard rate for purchase response at hour t. The baseline hazard h(0) represents the cloudy weather condition when all variables in the function of Uiweather are equal to 0. Weather-related covariates here are also at the hourly level. To further control for the behavioral effects of weather, we analyze data in the daytime hours during weekdays. During the nighttime period, the weather effects should go away because there is no sunlight after dark. Also, people will be less affected by rain when they are indoors at night (see Appendix B). Taking this into account, our hazard models use the hourly weather data of daytime hours (from 9 . . to 5 . .). Results of Cox proportional hazard models are presented in Table 5. As an hour-by-hour analysis across individuals, the number of observations in the hazard models (55,164,292) is larger than that in the logit model (6,744,884).6 The results in Table 5 indicate significant positive effects of sunshine (coefficient 0.5481, p < 0.05) and negative effects of rainfall (coefficient -0.5247, p < 0.05) on purchase hazard; that is, the hazard rate of purchase responses in sunny weather is 73% faster than that in cloudy weather. By contrast, the hazard rate of purchasing in rainy weather is 59% slower than that in cloudy weather. Table 5, column (4), results support that when the weather is sunny, the prevention frame ad copy

leads to slower purchase hazard (coefficient -0.3844, p < 0.001) than the neutral ad copy.

4.1. Additional Analyses Furthermore, we considered two types of changes in weather, backward looking and forward looking, to test the effects of sunny and rainy weather relative to cloudy weather on purchase responses (i.e., to extend the results in Table 2 with changes in weather). For the backward-looking weather changes, if the weather yesterday was rainy, people may possibly suppose it will still be rainy today. Yet, if the weather turns out to be sunny, then this change to better weather (from rain to sunshine) will put consumers in a better mood than

no weather change (sunny­sunny in a row), thus likely inducing more responses. To test this, we code Better than Yesterday as 2 if the weather changes from rainy to sunny and 1 if from cloudy to sunny or from rainy to cloudy. We coded Worse than Yesterday in a similar way. The baseline here is no change in weather (i.e., sunny­sunny, rainy­rainy, or cloudy­cloudy in a row). The results in Table 6 confirm that Better than Yesterday indeed increases the purchase response likelihood, and Worse than Yesterday decreases it. Additionally, column (3) in Table 6 shows that after controlling for the backward-looking changes in weather, the effects of current sunny and rainy weather are still consistent and significant (all p < 0.05).
For the forward-looking weather changes, we test whether consumers are less (more) likely to respond to promotions when the real weather is worse (better) than forecast. We code Better than Forecast as 2 if the forecast is for rainy weather but it turns out to be sunny,

and 1 if the forecast is for rainy weather but it turns out to be cloudy or if the forecast is for cloudy weather but it turns out to be sunny. We code Worse than Forecast in a similar fashion. With modern technologies, weather forecasts are 70% accurate and 30% inaccurate (thus there are some variations in forward-looking weather changes). Results in Table 7 support that Better than Forecast indeed increases the purchase response likelihood, and Worse than Forecast decreases it. Also, we find consistent and significant effects of sunny and rainy weather on purchase responses, even after controlling for forward-looking unexpected changes.
Next, we test how deviation from normal weather matters. If a certain area has a normal, expected weather with rainfall or a cloudy sky, a good deviation with relatively rare events of sunny days would lead to better moods and thus more responses. According to climate conditions, China can be divided into northern and southern regions with the Qinling­Huaihe line. The northern region, with 16 provinces, belongs to the temperate zone, while the southern region, with 15 provinces, belongs to the subtropical zone. Figure 5 depicts the normal weather frequency across the regions. In the north, sunny weather is the normal weather with the highest frequency, followed by cloudy and then rainy weather. In the south, the normally expected weather is cloudy, followed by rainy and sunny. The Table 8 results support the consistent positive effect of sunny and the negative effect of rainy. Also, results in both logit and linear probabilistic models suggest that the interaction term Sunny × South is positive and significant. Thus, good sunshine deviation

from the normal cloudy weather in the south (a relatively rare event of sunny weather) indeed engenders more purchase responses than in the north.
As a falsification test, we check the robustness via the interaction between weather and temperature. Although sunshine is usually associated with nice weather, when the temperature is too hot, sunlight may have a negative effect on mood (Cohen 2011, Zwebner et al. 2014).7 Results in column (1) of Table 9 indeed show that the interaction between sunny weather and temperature (highest degree of the day) is significantly negative, as expected. Also, the results support the positive interaction effect between rainy weather and the highest temperature. This finding also passes the falsification test because a warmer rainy day is relatively better weather compared with a colder rainy day to consumers.

5. Another Randomized Field Experiment on App Ads
The second field experiment tackles two main objectives: generalizability of the main effects of sunny and rainy weather and a possible mood explanation for the effects. This experiment uses a different mobile product with a book-reading digital service (similar to Kindle but on a mobile app platform). The app is one of the most popular mobile reading applications in China, providing more than 400,000 e-books to over 300 million users. Randomized app notification ads were sent to 45,733 app users nationwide on May 7, May 19, and June 4, 2015. From the 45,733 app users, 40,266

of them were in the ad groups, and 5,467 were in the control group. The control group (without ad) is a randomized holdout control, so the control has ex ante holdout samples that are similar to the treated groups (with ads). Also, indirectly identifying the psychological mood effect of weather, this experiment has two app ads: one recommending mood-related romantic book titles and one recommending mood-neutral biographical book titles.8 After receiving app ads, interested users could respond by making an in-app purchase. Here we also are able to control for mobile usage behavior with app launch (how many times the user opens the reading app each day) and app session (how many minutes the user reads conditional on opening the app). The two field experiment data sets differ in terms of products (video streaming versus book read-

However, this experiment did not test the speed of response or the effect of ad copy frame. Thus, it serves at least as a replication of the positive effect of sunny weather and negative effect of rainy weather on incremental mobile ad sales compared with cloudy weather.
Figure 6 suggests that the effects are incremental. As reported in Appendix C, panel A, formal statistical t-test results consistently support the positive effect

Tobit regression models reported in Table 10, panel A, and the coefficient tests of logit models reported in Appendix D, the results also support the positive sunny weather effect (coefficient difference 0.3534, p 0.0009) and the negative rainy weather effect (coefficient difference -0.1061, p 0.011) relative to cloudy weather on incremental sales of mobile ads. The test in Appendix D, panel A, also shows that sunny weather with ads and cloudy weather with ads both generate incremental sales, while rainy weather with ads does not increase sales, and that the sunny effect is bigger

than the cloudy effect, which in turn is bigger than the rainy effect. Results of difference-in-differences tests also support the statistically significantly incremental effects over the control group (see Appendix E). Thus, results from both the model-free t-test and the regression model indeed replicate the positive effect of sunny weather and the negative effect of rainy weather on incremental mobile ad sales relative to cloudy weather.
Next, we examined the incremental interaction effects between weather and specific book ads. The results in Appendix C, panel B, on t-tests support that sunny weather does have a stronger positive effect on the mood-related (versus mood-neutral) book titles (p < 0.05). Yet, rainy weather does not have a different effect on the mood-related (versus mood-neutral) book titles (p > 0.10). Consistently, the regression results in Table 10, panel B, and the coefficient tests results show that sunny weather does have a marginally stronger positive effect on the mood-related (versus moodneutral) book titles (coefficient difference 0.1147, p 0.078). However, rainy weather does not have a different effect on the mood-related (versus moodneutral) book titles (coefficient difference 0.1061, p > 0.10). The difference-in-differences results reported in Appendix E also support that sunny weather does have a stronger positive effect on the mood-related (versus mood-neutral) book titles (p < 0.05). Also, rainy weather does not have a different effect on the moodrelated (versus mood-neutral) book titles (p > 0.10). We speculate that mood-related book ads may improve users' mood states, which would match sunny weather but not rainy weather. This might explain why the incremental results here replicate the interaction effects between sunny weather and ad copy of the main study, but not the interaction effects between rainy weather and ad copy. Nevertheless, results in this additional field experiment consistently support the theme that incremental purchase response to mobile ads is greater in sunny weather compared to cloudy weather, and lower in rainy weather compared to cloudy weather. They also show interactions with the specific ad, especially involving sunny weather, albeit not with rainy weather.9
6. Conclusion
Firms are leveraging local weather information to increase the relevancy and effectiveness of their promotions. Yet, little causal evidence exists in the literature, especially with field data, on how sunny and rainy weather affect consumer purchase responses to promotions. Using data sets from large-scale field experiments, we find that the following:
· Purchase responses to promotions are higher and faster in sunny weather, but lower and slower in rainy weather, relative to cloudy weather. In terms of odds ratios, sunshine leads to about 1.21 times more

response to mobile promotions, and rainfall leads to about 0.9 times less response than cloudy weather.
· Survival models at the hourly level suggest the hazard rate of purchase responses in sunny weather is 73% faster than that in cloudy weather. By contrast, the hazard rate of purchasing in rainy weather is 59% slower than that in a cloudy sky.
· Better-than-yesterday weather and better-thanforecast weather engender more purchase responses, and vice versa. A good deviation from the expected rainy or cloudy weather with relatively rare events of sunny days will substantially boost purchase responses to mobile promotions.
· The ad copy of mobile promotions interacts with sunshine and rainfall. Compared with a neutral frame ad copy, the prevention frame hurts the initial promotion boost by sunshine, but improves the initial promotion drop due to rainfall.
Our study has a number of limitations, which serve as avenues for future research. First, it is limited to the setting of mobile digital services and may not be generalizable to nonmobile settings such as physical products or even desktop platforms. We tested two mobile platforms (SMS versus app) with two digital products (video streaming versus e-book reading). However, both products' valuations are not strictly weather neutral. Valuations for mobile products will be higher if a consumer believes that she will be more likely to spend time outside, where only mobile devices can be used for watching videos or reading books. Also, both products are similar (streaming and reading are both spare-time entertainment) and somewhat weather-related (consumers are more apt to stream or read in bad weather, which means that our results may be more conservative). Thus, it will be important to support generalizable results with other settings and other products that are weather neutral in future research.10 Also, because of a lack of corporate support, we do not have a happy positive ad copy in the field data. This is a limitation of our study, and future research may test how sunny weather fits a happy, optimistic ad copy. Furthermore, our results suggest that on cloudy days, the neutral ad copy is moderately better than the prevention ad copy. Future tests could reveal more nuanced effects of sunny, rainy, and cloudy weather on consumer response to ads with promotion, prevention, and neutral message frames.
In addition, our research with field experiment datasets cannot directly measure moods and gauge underlying psychological mechanisms. It is not a direct test of theoretical mechanisms, but rather a test with hypotheses motivated by theory. Future research with lab studies may explore the mechanisms of how, on rainy days, consumers may activate mood repair mindsets and engage in more indulgent responses to mobile promotions (Pham et al. 2012, Isen 2001, Schwarz and Clore

Li et al.: Sunny, Rainy, and Cloudy with a Chance of Mobile Promotion Marketing Science, 2017, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 762­779, © 2017 INFORMS

1983). Also, it would be interesting for future research to test how weather is related to consumer risk seeking or risk avoidance (Parker and Tavassoli 2000, Reinholtz et al. 2014).
Also, a distinct aspect of weather-based mobile promotions relates to weather awareness and the ability to check weather multiple times using a mobile app. Yet, people are aware of current weather even without checking their mobile devices, especially during daytime (simply by looking out the window). Modern mobile and digital technologies may allow advertisers to access information about consumers' locations and local weather (past, present, forecast) and even competitors' customer activities that were not possible before (Luo et al. 2014, Fang et al. 2015, Andrews et al. 2016, Dubé et al. 2017). Thus, future research may test how such information can be used for optimizing mobile ad message and delivery timing.
Finally, industry practitioners have long argued that advertisers need to integrate weather-related data in online display programmatic environments. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (Marshall 2014) are testing how to effectively target users by their local weather.11 There are also outdoor billboard ads based on real-time, location-based data including weather as tested by Google. In this sense, future research may explore smartphones, the Internet of things, and smart

technologies at home, in the office, and in the city toward a broader context of weather-based promotions and ad copy design.
In conclusion, this is an initial step in identifying the causal sales impacts of sunny and rainy weather. We hope it can serve as a springboard for future research to examine how consumers respond to mobile ads and promotions in various weather conditions.

Appendix B. More Robustness Checks B.1. Smaller Sample Size We also randomly selected 25% and 50% of observations to test the main weather effects and the interaction effects of weather and ad copy frame (Table B.1). The results show a consistent positive sunny effect and negative rainy effect. Also, the significant interaction terms indicate a consistent negative interactive effect of sunny weather and a prevention frame and positive interactive effect of rainy weather and a prevention frame.
B.2. Weather Effects During Night Hours If the relevant aspect of weather is the presence of sunlight or rainfall, the promotion effects should vanish after sundown. In other words, at nighttime, people's moods should be less likely to be influenced by outside sunny or rainy weather, because they are likely inside their home, i.e., not exposed to outside sunlight or rainfall. We tested the effects

2 We acknowledge the associate editor for the notion that while prior weather studies focus on purchases, we focus on promotion effectiveness, or incremental purchase responses to promotions.
3 As manipulation checks, independent raters with 94 smartphone users confirmed that users indeed interpreted the wording of "do not miss the opportunity" as loss-avoidance-type negative message, i.e., preventing users from the negative outcomes of missing the deal. Also, the neutral frame with the general greeting was confirmed as neutral (smallest interrater correlations 0.91, p < 0.001). Using these two ad copies, there were a total of 38 SMS campaigns. Though not perfectly balanced, 18 prevention and 20 neutral ad copies existed purely because of the corporate agenda, rather than researcher intervention.
4 The corporate partner tends to keep a randomized holdout control for all field tests. So, the control has ex ante holdout samples that are similar to the treated samples. This control group size is much smaller. This is not totally unexpected because companies oftentimes do not prefer to have a large-size control group, because of the notion that the control group has opportunity costs (since the control group receives no promotions and often does not generate sales, while any promotions generally engender some sales). Indeed, a recent study by Hoban and Bucklin (2015) also had a much smaller control group.
5 Because our results are robust to hour-by-hour analyses, the case with self-section bias not controlled for would be consumers strategically moving to better climates within one hour, which is not highly feasible for consumers.
6 In the hour-by-hour survival analyses with over 55 million rows in the hazard model, each run with high-performance computing with parallel processing cost around two weeks.
7 The interaction effect between weather and wind power is not included in the robustness check as there is no extreme value of wind power in our field data.
8 Independent raters with 86 app users of the e-books confirmed that the mood-related romance titles (Love after Pain and Loneliness, a Glorious Failure) were indeed perceived to be moody, feelings-related readings, and the mood-neutral titles (biographical titles of Team of Kun Chen and Story of Old-Time Ladies) were indeed reported to be feeling-neutral readings (smallest interrater correlations 0.93, p < 0.001). The mood-related book titles could be perceived as depressing at first glance. However, subjects may actually improve their mood upon reading the depressing titles, similar to the case where after watching a depressing or sad movie, people may cry with tears but actually feel better, i.e., have an improved mood. So, moodrelated book titles here, with improved mood, would match sunny weather but not rainy weather. This might explain why the incremental results here replicate the interaction effects between sunny weather and ad copy of the main study, but not the interaction effects between rainy weather and ad copy.
9 We conducted a follow-up survey to explore the underlying mechanism. The survey evidence confirmed that mood partially mediates the effects of weather conditions on mobile promotion responses.
10 Our work here involves mobile products relatively less directly tied to weather (mobile digital services), rather than products (sunglasses or umbrellas) directly tied to sunshine or rain. This allows weatherbased mobile targeting for more types of digital products.
11 Many firms run online ads according to weather conditions via Twitter (Beck 2014) and the Facebook ad platform (Robertson 2013). Coors Light and Molson Canadian Cider used the programming interface of Weather Underground. When the weather was sunny and hot, it triggered Facebook mobile ads targeting the local weather.
