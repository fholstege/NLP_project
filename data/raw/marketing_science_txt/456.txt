This paper develops and calibrates a simple yet comprehensive set of models for the evolution of binary attribute importance weights, based on a cue­goal association framework. We argue that the utility a consumer ascribes to an attribute comes from its association with the achievement of a goal. We investigate how associations may be represented and then track back the relationship of these associations to the utility function. We explain why we believe this to be an important problem before providing an overview of the extensive literature on learning models. This literature identifies key phenomena and provides a foundation for our modeling of binary attribute importance learning, which can test for three departures from "rational" learning--bias, existence of priors, and the unequal weighting of sample observations (order effects). We apply our models in a laboratory setting under a number of different relationship strengths, and we find that, in our application, consumers' learning about attribute­goal associations exhibits bias and the effects of prior beliefs when the sample realizations occur with and without noise, and order effects when the sample realizations occur with noise. We provide an example of how our models can be extended to learning about more than one attribute.

1. Introduction
In many markets discontinuous change is common with the introduction of new products, features, and attributes (e.g., Sood and Tellis 2005). The specific case of binary product features is an important one, both in practice and in terms of academic research. Binary attributes may arise from technological standards. NTSC/PAL, HTML5, MP3, and Blu-ray are a few of the many.1 They may take the form of product variants (e.g., low-calorie beer, diet cola, decaffeinated coffee) or attributes that are naturally dichotomous (electronic fuel injection, cabriolet, rear-screen demister). Binary attributes may occur as ingredient brands or endorsers (e.g., the Heart Foundation Tick, specific country of origin indicators,
1 NTSC: National Television System Committee, PAL: phase alternate line, HTML5: hypertext markup language 5, MP3: MPEG audio layer 3.

Dolby Sound, Intel Inside, individual operating systems such as Android). Finally, many manufacturers dichotomize inherently continuous attributes to simplify the consumer decision process. For example, instead of quality, manufacturers may use economy or deluxe; instead of tiers of service level in airlines, they may use coach or business class, and instead of an octane rating for gas, they may use standard or super. When confronted by these binary attributes or features for the first time, consumers have to learn whether their presence will add value to the product.
Turbulent markets with changing products and product features require dynamic models to represent the evolution of sales over time and the behavioral states of consumers that underpin them. Approaches taken in prior research include dynamic coefficient models (Bass et al. 2007), structural models (Gönül and Srinivasan 1996), linear learning models

(Kuehn 1958, Lilien 1974), and Bayesian models (Iyengar et al. 2007).
Dynamics may be studied at the aggregate or individual level. We may be interested in changes in the levels of different variables or, more fundamentally, in the changing relationship between them. For example, in terms of promotional response, Guadagni and Little (1983) look at how choice changes with promotional activity, whereas Jedidi et al. (1999) study how the parameters of that relationship change over time.
We are interested in representing individuallevel learning processes about the utility of new binary product attributes (also known as importance weights)--that is, the relationship between an attribute and its utility. Understanding the dynamics of importance weight formation is of considerable concern. The behavioral literature suggests that these cannot be taken as given (e.g., Bettman et al. 1998), and in categories with new radical product introductions, managers need to understand the trajectory by which consumer preferences will evolve.
In terms of academic research, the evaluation of binary attributes is a major area of study (e.g., Keeney and Raiffa 1976), whereas behavioral learning experiments in psychology rely mainly on the use of binary features (e.g., van Osselaer and Alba 2003). In studies of consumer decision processes, binary attributes have also attracted considerable attention (e.g., Fader and McAlister 1990).
Given the significance of binary attribute importance evolution, theoretically and in the marketplace, a way of representing the process algebraically is valuable. With it, we can estimate the ultimate preference level of a product with a given set of new attributes and calibrate the time trajectory by which that preference will be formed.
We first review the behavioral learning literature to identify the phenomena involved and examine existing models used to represent the consumer learning process. We then build on previous modeling approaches to develop a simple approach to test for the presence of previously identified phenomena in the learning of associative relationships and hence utility. Finally, we apply our models to consumer learning about a new software agent in a laboratory setting. We examine how the rate, degree, and consistency of learning vary as a function of the association between the attribute's presence and the expected reward it provides, and we test the models' predictive ability. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the presence of correlated attributes and using a different data generation process before closing with a discussion of the implications and limitations of our research.
We aim to make a contribution at a number of levels. First, and most important, we provide a

parsimonious set of models of associative learning that can test for a wide range of behavioral phenomena. Second, we explicitly model the relationship between consumer learning about associations and utility. Finally, we use our approach to empirically examine how learning varies as a function of the strength of the relationship between the presence of an attribute and goal achievement and the presence of noise in one particular application.
2. Consumer Learning of Associations and Relationships
Research in psychology and marketing suggests that consumers have difficulty evaluating stimuli with which they have little or no familiarity. For example, Alba and Hutchinson (2000) show that for unfamiliar attributes, consumers may not have the necessary information to make an accurate estimate of the association between the presence of the attribute and achievement of a goal, whereas Simonson and Tversky (1992) suggest that new features alter the information context facing consumers. Both literatures point to consumers undergoing a learning process whereby information about an attribute is integrated into their belief structures progressively (e.g., Hoeffler and Ariely 1999). van Osselaer and Janiszewski (2001) argue that integration of new information can be represented by an associative learning model, a position supported in psychology (Wasserman and Miller 1997). The associative learning model examines the extent to which the presence of a stimulus or cue (in our case, an attribute) aids the achievement of a consumer's goals (Lawson 1997). Consumers predict the likelihood of goal achievement by integrating information about the co-occurrence of a stimulus and goal achievement into an associative judgment.
Associative learning occurs when a goal, Y , and a stimulus, x, become linked when repeatedly presented together (Wasserman and Miller 1997). We denote goal achievement by Y = 1 (and its converse by Y = 0) and the presence of a stimulus (in our case, a product attribute) by x = 1 (and its absence by x = 0). We represent the strength of association between the goal (Y and stimulus (x by the conditional probability y x (i.e., the probability that the goal is achieved (Y = 1) or not (Y = 0) in the presence (x = 1 or absence (x = 0 of the stimulus). Lopez et al. (1998b) argue that repeated pairing of goal achievement with a stimulus leads to formation of a perceived association between the two. In the limit, under rational updating, this process allows consumers to estimate the association as the relative frequency with which the goal is achieved in the presence of the attribute.

2.1. Departures from Frequency-Based Estimation Whereas associative learning provides a conceptual framework for how consumers discover the effect of an attribute, numerous studies indicate that consumer judgments often depart from simple frequency-based estimation in systematic ways. We consider three key departures in the literature relevant to the learning of importances: bias, existence of priors, and unequal weighting of sample observations (order effects).
Biased Learning. Alloy and Tabachnik (1984) claim that learning towards true conditional probabilities may not always occur. In ambiguous environments, perceptual encoding may systematically distort the learning of true associations, leading the consumer to an equilibrium estimate not equal to the true conditional probability. Incoming information may be incorporated in a biased way by confirmatory reasoning, skewed attention/perception effects, anchoring, and other distortions (Hoeffler et al. 2006). These biases may be resistant to disconfirmation.
Prior Beliefs. For a totally new stimulus with no information cues, we would expect the consumer to have highly diffuse priors about the value it will provide in meeting her goals (which is equivalent to assuming that she applies frequency-based estimation). However, the behavioral literature suggests that consumers often enter a learning situation with prior beliefs. They often make use of secondary indicators, such as store experience or relationships with retailers, as a basis for attribute evaluation. If the introduction of new attributes has historically been associated with product improvements (or declines), the availability heuristic may lead to the formation of such priors. Similarly, inferencing might lead consumers to form prior beliefs based on the name or context of an attribute (e.g., Kardes et al. 2004). A range of other evaluation processes or assumptions may also lead the consumer to form prior beliefs about the utility of the new stimulus (e.g., consumer traits such as optimism or pessimism).
Order Effects. Associative learning experiments commonly find order effects. That is, the order in which information is presented to subjects influences their ultimate learning. Recency effects (where later information is given more weight than earlier data) have been observed in a number of associative learning experiments (e.g., Lopez et al. 1998b). Other studies have observed primacy effects (e.g., Marsh and Ahn 2006); that is, once early information has shaped beliefs, later information has difficulty in dislodging these "sticky priors" and is not given equal weight (Hoch and Deighton 1989).

2.2. Models of Consumer Learning These departures from "rational" decision making in the estimation of associations may appear in concert, with two or three being observed in a given situation. They are likely to be more pronounced in unfamiliar categories (Kahn and Meyer 1991). Thus, our modeling of binary attribute importance formation needs to account for dynamics, including the possibility of biased learning, prior beliefs, and order effects.
Given the importance of associative learning, it is not surprising that there is substantial literature on how to represent it in mathematical terms. Most are at the aggregate level (e.g., McGough 2003), but there are some individual-level models (e.g., Johar et al. 1997). We are specifically interested in consumer learning about new binary attribute importance, but we can build on these models. In particular, to represent importance weight evolution, we can use models of stimulus­goal conditional probability learning, as long as we have a mechanism by which to transform those probabilities to utilities.
Table 1 provides a representative selection of individual-level learning models, with the phenomena each incorporates and the type of learning studied. The research of Rescorla and Wagner (1972) describes an early approach to modeling associative learning in psychology, one in which an error reduction (or partial adjustment) model is used to represent association updating. Pearce (1994) and Cheng (1997) represent two additional foundational papers. Subsequent models have postulated different learning mechanisms and formulations. In particular, a number of authors have represented the learning phenomena identified in the previous section. For example, Anderson and Lebiere (1998) provide a model with prior beliefs, while Gerber and Green (1999) allow for

bias in the ultimate learning level. Still others examine the order effects of information (e.g., Bradlow et al. 2004). However, no studies in this tradition focus on the specific problem of attribute weight learning.
Although the models in Table 1 provide useful insight into the dynamics of consumer learning, they suffer a number of disadvantages for the specific problem of describing importance weight formation. First, no one is complete with respect to the phenomena identified in the previous section. Second, many of them are quite complex and difficult to calibrate (often because they were developed for other purposes). Finally, in most cases their algebraic form has been chosen to fit the data. We would ideally like a model or set of models that is based on how the consumer would behave if she used a process of formal statistical inference to estimate importance and to then model departures from that process.
3. A Parsimonious Modeling Approach to Binary Attribute Learning
Our goal is to develop models that are parsimonious with respect to data requirements, fit the learning process well, are complete with respect to the phenomena previously observed in the literature, and are consistent with a utility-maximizing consumer. Our approach to associative learning allows for a wide range of observed phenomena, and it has a ready translation into utility. We know of no other model that captures bias, priors, and order effects simultaneously, nor any that draws the link between associative learning and utility-maximizing behavior.
We tackle the modeling of consumer learning about new binary attribute importances in two steps. First, in §3.1 we describe how the consumer learns about the relationship between the presence (or absence) of a feature and the achievement of her goals. Second, in §3.2 we show how this cue­goal association may be translated into utility judgments about the value of the attribute to the consumer.
3.1. Learning About the Relationship Between a Feature's Presence and Goal Achievement
To represent how consumers learn about associations, we initially assume a separable utility function so we can study one attribute at a time.2 The consumer does not know the true association between the
2 See Keeney and Raiffa (1976) for a discussion of this assumption in multiattribute utility models in decision analysis and Blackorby et al. (1977) for an economics perspective. We discuss and demonstrate the extension to more than one attribute, including interattribute correlation, in §6.2.

presence or absence of an attribute and the achieve-

ment of her goal, but she observes the relative co-

occurrences over t exposures. That is, the consumer is

exposed to information pairs (i.e., sample realizations)

x1 y1 x2 y2

xi yi

xt yt , where at the

ith observation, the attribute is either present (xi = 1)

or not (xi = 0) and the goal is achieved (yi = 1) or

not (yi = 0).

We are interested in how the consumer's estimates

of the associative probabilities y x evolve over time.

Let

denote the consumer's estimate at time t

of 1 1, the underlying probability that the goal is met

when x = 1.3

Similarly, let

denote the consumer's

estimate at time t of 1 0, the probability that the goal

is met when x = 0.

Model 1: Base Model Learning. Faced with t information pairs, we assume that a consumer with no information processing bias, no prior beliefs, and no order effects will approach the problem as a statistician. Given the assumed Bernoulli nature of goal achievement in the presence or absence of the focal attribute, the likelihood function for 1 1 and 1 0 is given by

Model 2: Biased Learning. Model 1 is based on a consumer with no information processing bias. Suppose the consumer systematically processes information with bias because of selective attention, distortion, and/or retention of information, as suggested in the previous section. In particular, we assume that the presence of the attribute (x = 1) is correctly perceived. However, errors occur in terms of whether or

sponds to the consumer underestimating the associ-

ation between the attribute and goal realization, and

p > 1 corresponds to an overestimation. This is consis-

tent with Gerber and Green (1999), who assume that

an individual assimilates a fixed proportion of discon-

firming information. An alternative, but algebraically

similar process, would occur if the consumer does

record the observation but fails to update her estimate

of the cue­goal association (Miller and Matzel 1988,

van Osselaer and Alba 2000).5

Model 3: Prior Beliefs Influencing Learning. The

above two models of association estimation assume

that the consumer has no prior beliefs before gain-

ing information about the efficacy of the attribute in

achieving her goal. The literature section suggested

that this might not be the case.

Therefore, we allow the consumer to approach the

new attribute with priors about the association. Given

the Bernoulli process that lies behind Equation (1),

we assume that prior beliefs about the probability 1 1 are captured by a beta distribution with parameters

and . (Similarly defined prior beliefs about the

probability of goal achievement in its absence, 1 0, are distributed beta with parameters analogous to

and .)

As

such, it is not time dependent. We have subscripted it by t in this

1 1 as their mean). As t increases, any difference between f1t 1 and 1 1 gets small. For notational simplicity, we drop the time subscript on p in the model development that follows. Note that p is

We note that if a new attribute is introduced into a
product category with which the consumer is famil-
iar, we would not expect to see learning about goal
achievement in the absence of the attribute ( 1 0 . If the product category is also new, changes in 1 0 will capture learning about other product elements.

Model 4: Order Effects Model (Learning with
Recency or Primacy). To represent the possibility that earlier information is partially forgotten or discounted (recency) or is more influential in cementing beliefs early (primacy), we allow the weight of an observation to be a function of when it is received, replacing xi by ixi for xi = 1 (and analogously for xi = 0). Following Bradlow et al. (2004), we assume geometric decay (or growth) in the observation's weight. That is,
i = i where is the decay/growth rate for xi = 1. Conditional on we can write the maximum likelihood estimator of the order effects model as

3.2. Translating an Understanding of Association

into Utility Judgments

Our research objective is to present a parsimo-

nious representation of consumers' learning about

the importance of a binary attribute. The models

presented in Equations (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) pro-

vide representations of how consumers' subjective

estimates of the association between the presence or

absence of an attribute and the achievement of a goal

evolve under different assumptions about consumer

learning. The next step is to explore the mapping

of these associations to the expected utility of goal

achievement.

We are interested in the utility of a new binary

attribute x in a multiattribute utility setting. Given

our assumption of separability, we can consider the

contribution of the attribute to the product's overall

utility independently of other attributes. We denote

the utility of x as U x .

The standard approach to multiattribute utility the-

ory typically represents U x as a linear function

of the attribute level x weighted by the consumer's

attribute importance or tastes w1 (e.g., Keeney and Raiffa 1976):

U x = w0 + w1x

(7)

The importance of a binary attribute is simply the

change in utility associated with its presence relative

to its absence (i.e., U x = 1 - U x = 0 ).
It is typically assumed that w1 is an intrinsic property of a consumer, as if part of the consumer's

genetic makeup (e.g., McFadden 2001), and that

attribute levels are determined independent of the

consumer through the value chain of production.

Hence, the consumer knows her tastes but may be

uncertain about the product's attribute levels. This

leads to the modeling of utility dynamics based on

consumer learning about attribute levels (e.g., Roberts

and Urban 1988).

An alternative approach to multiattribute utility

theory draws on the ideas of Lancaster (1966): util-

ity is not derived directly from the attribute itself but

from the extent to which it assists in undertaking

a desirable consumption activity, which more gener-

ally results in the achievement of a goal Y . Lancaster

expresses this idea in the following algebraic terms:

U x = a x UY
where UY is the utility associated with goal achievement (or successful undertaking of the activity), and a x is a scalar that represents the extent to which attribute x assists in undertaking that consumption activity. It follows that the utility of a binary attribute is a function of the extent to which its presence assists in undertaking the consumption activity, relative to its absence:

U x = 1 - U x = 0 = a x = 1 - a x = 0 UY (8)

With reference to Equation (7), this gives us

w1 = aUY

(9)

where a = a x = 1 - a x = 0 . This Lancasterian-motivated interpretation of a
consumer's attribute importance judgment has implications for modeling a consumer's learning about w1. Equation (9) decomposes attribute importance into two components, one determined by the consumer's utility of a consumption activity (or goal achievement), UY , and the other determined by the degree to which the product attribute facilitates the achievement of the consumption-related goal. We assume that a consumer's uncertainty about the value of the attribute, w1, arises from her being uncertain about a, the degree to which the attribute facilitates the achievement of goal Y . There is no uncertainty about the utility derived from Y . (A natural extension would be to allow for learning about the utility of the consumption activity, UY .) Dynamics in attribute importances are represented by adding a time subscript to Equation (9):

w1t = atUY

(10)

Note that under this formulation, changes in utility (and, from them, choice) arise from changes in consumers' attribute importance judgments (w1t), not changes in perceived attribute or feature levels (which are assumed known).
So far, our Lancasterian-motivated view of importance weights assumes a deterministic relationship between the presence or absence of an attribute and the extent to which it assists in a consumption activity. We now introduce a stochastic element and assume that an attribute's presence may change the probability (rather than degree) of goal achievement. We propose that the presence of the new attribute leads to a utility of UY with probability 1 1, while its absence leads to a utility of UY with probability 1 0. Denoting expected utility by EU( · ), the expected utility associated with the attribute's presence and absence are EU(x = 1 = 1 1UY and EU(x = 0 = 1 0UY , respectively. It follows that the utility of a binary attribute is a function of the extent to which its presence or absence changes the probability of goal achievement. Thus, the stochastic analog of the deterministic Equation (9) is

w1 = 1 xUY

(11)

where 1 x = 1 1 - 1 0. Within the psychology and consumer behavior literatures, the difference in
associations (i.e., 1 x) is known as the contingency (Janiszewski and Warlop 1993, Lopez et al. 1998a).
It is the increased (or decreased) probability of goal
achievement brought about by the presence of the

Chylinski, Roberts, and Hardie: Consumer Learning of New Binary Attribute Importance

555

attribute relative to its absence. We can therefore write our expected utility equivalent of Equation (7) as

EU x = 1 0UY + 1 xUY x

(12)

Thus, Equation (12) shows that the consumer's

increased valuation on seeing the attribute present

is proportional to the differential probability that its

presence has on the consumer achieving her goal,

1 x = 1 1 - 1 0--the so-called goal contingency of the attribute. Equation (12) establishes the role of

associations within an expected utility framework.

Combining Equation (12) with the association for-

mation Equations (1)­(3), (5), and (6), we see how

rational updating, as well as updating with bias, pri-

ors, and order effects, impacts importance weight

learning.

We can extend this logic to the case of K attributes

(x1 x2

xK . Let 1 x1x2 ··· xK denote the probability of

goal achievement given attribute levels x1 x2

xK.

Assuming the impact of a change in the level of an

attribute is independent of the levels of the other

attributes (i.e., separability), the multivariate exten-

sion of Equation (12) is straightforward:

4. Model Calibration
We have presented a modeling approach for understanding the evolution of consumer learning of the importance of a new binary attribute. We propose that the utility a consumer ascribes to an attribute comes from its association with the achievement of a goal motivating the consumption of the associated product or service. We have identified three departures from "rationality"--bias, existence of priors, and the unequal weighting of sample observations (order effects)--and presented a set of parsimonious models that capture the evolution of preferences given these departures. We now test these alternative representations and the association-to-utility mapping using data from an experiment based on a classical conditioning design. We examine how learning varies as a function of strength of the relationship between the presence of an attribute and goal achievement, and the presence of noise in one particular application.

Our primary experiment collects data on subjects' utility judgments and assessments of the probability of goal achievement Y . With repeated measurements for each subject, we can estimate how attribute­ goal association and attribute­utility judgments are updated with more information.
The masking task is one of stock picking. The subjects' task was to choose the equity from a set of four that they thought would increase in value the most. Thus, the goal (Y ) is one of picking the stock that will return the highest gain. Subjects were nominally paid $100 when they selected an equity with the highest short-term capital gain. There were no gains or losses associated with selecting an equity that did not yield highest short-term capital gain. Therefore, UY = $100. This stock-picking task was repeated multiple times, with the set of four stocks varying randomly on each stock selection occasion.
For each stock selection, subjects saw the stock recommendation from a (hypothetical) Internet-based equity trading software agent called E-T.com. This agent had (or did not have) two potentially salient product attributes called "Neural Net" (x and "Temporally Continuous" (z .6 The software agent advised subjects on which equity to choose, but they did not have to accept its recommendation.
After each subject had selected the equity that she thought would increase in value the most, the subject was then told which equity actually had, thus providing information about goal achievement and, indirectly, the accuracy of an agent with specific levels of the two attributes x and z. For each selection, the agent with a given set of characteristics recommended the correct stock according to a Bernoulli process. An agent with x = 1 recommended the correct stock with probability 1 1, while an agent with x = 0 recommended the correct stock with probability 1 0. (z was included as a control attribute, and initially, only the presence or absence of x affected the accuracy of the agent's recommendations in terms of subjects' goal achievement.) This provided the subject with information pair (xi yi . The task of equity selection was a mask for the true (conditioning) purpose of the experiment.
For each replication of the experiment, the subject undertook four batches of four stock picks. The four stock pick tasks in each batch were accompanied by recommendations from an agent with given levels of (x z) pairing. Subjects saw the four batches, associated with the four (0 1) combinations of the two attributes, in a random order. Having made 16 stock picks, subjects were then asked to estimate how many

tional simplicity.

times the goal would be achieved over the next 100 trades if they followed the agent's recommendation (for an agent with given levels of x and z . We denote these quantities by Njr 1 1 , Njr 1 0 , Njr 0 1 , and Njr 0 0 , where, for example, Njr 1 0 denotes subject j's estimate for an agent with characteristics x = 1 and z = 0 at the end of replication r.
To get a direct assessment of the utility of an agent with characteristics (x z , subjects were also asked at the end of each replication how much they would pay (or have to be paid) per trade to use an agent with those characteristics relative to a "baseline" agent (e.g., what would make an agent with characteristics (x = 1 z = 1) of equal value to an agent with characteristics (x = 0 z = 1)), thus giving an assessment of the utility of attribute x. Each subject undertook 12 replications (r = 1 12), thereby providing data that enables us to study the dynamics of learning. Examples of the stimuli used and exact measures taken are included in Web Appendix A (at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1120.0719).
To investigate whether the phenomena represented in our models vary as a function of the strength of relationship between the attribute and the goal, we manipulate the contingencies (i.e., 1 1 - 1 0 between subjects. We chose nine different contingencies, which are given in Table 2, in terms of their constituent associations. Because the achievement (or not) of the goal was generated using a random draw from a Bernoulli process, the realized conditional probabilities are not exactly the same as the underlying (programmed) values of the goal­attribute associations.
We recruited 135 subjects for the experiment from a population of undergraduate business and MBA students. This allowed 15 subjects per contingency condition. Subjects were offered a sure reward of $20 plus a chance of winning $500 to participate. Subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions.
The new product, a software agent to assist in equity selection, is a realistic one and is salient

4.1. Estimating the Association Models

As previously noted, subjects were asked at the end

of each replication for their estimate of how many

times their goal would be achieved over the next

100 trades if they followed the recommendations of

agents with (x z characteristics (1 1), (1 0), (0 1),

(0 0). Equations (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6), together with

their analogs for 1 0, specify our representations of individual j's (j = 1 J judgment of the probabil-

ities of goal achievement after t exposures for each of

our models. We wish to see the degree to which each

model describes the evolution of the Njr · · . The models of associative learning provide esti-

mates of the consumer's probabilities of goal achieve-

ment given the presence or absence of the attribute

after exposure to t information pairs, (x1 y1 ,

(x2 y2

xt yt). Subjects' direct assessments of

these probabilities were solicited at the end of each

replication. Since z is an irrelevant attribute for the

purposes of this study, we tested whether its pres-

ence or absence affected the subject's estimated asso-

ciations. We found no statistical difference between

the two levels of the irrelevant attribute (z), so we

pooled the z = 1 and z = 0 data to increase the sta-

tistical power of our results for the focal attribute x.

This means that by replication r, the subject had been

exposed to t = 8r pairs of information for both x = 1

and x = 0 (4r associated with both z = 1 and z = 0).

The parameter estimates for each model were

obtained by using nonlinear least squares. Given

the repeated measures nature of the data collected,

we estimate a mixed nonlinear model allowing for

a subject-specific random effect (with variance 2)

and decompose the error variance of the model

into replication-specific and contingency-specific

components (

2 r

and

2 c

,

respectively).

We

accommo-

date replication-specific error variances by allowing

them to vary over replication (r) in the following

manner:

2 r

= exp

r0 + r1r

.

Similarly,

we

accommo-

date contingency-specific variances by allowing them

to vary as function of the observed relative frequency

to date for each contingency. For the case of x = 1, we

7 Note that we are not suggesting that the majority of such stockpicking recommendation agents outperform random picks, or even that any do. All that we need is for subjects to believe that it is possible that they may. The presence of such products on the market, together with feedback from subject debriefing, suggests that this is not an unreasonable assumption.

,

and

we

an

formulation for the case of x = 0 using f1t 0.

We manipulated the degree of association between

the attribute presence/absence and goal achievement

(see Table 2) so that we can investigate whether

the phenomena represented in the models vary as a

function of the strength of relationship between the

attribute and the goal. In particular, we are inter-

ested in whether consumers underlearn (p < 1) or

overlearn (p > 1) when the attribute more frequently

leads to goal achievement ( y x is higher), whether the updating of priors occurs more quickly ( is lower),

and whether order effects are more pronounced ( is

higher or lower). Therefore, rather than estimating a

common p, , and , we allow them to vary across

conditions, writing them as a function of the observed

relative frequency to date for each association. For the

case of x = 1, we have

pt = p1 + p2f1t 1

 

t = 1 + 2f1t 1

t = 1 + 2f1t 1 

(14)

(These are similarly defined for x = 0 using f1t 0.) We believe that there is no reason why the prior
means should change with the (ex post) observed frequency, and so we do not let vary across associations. Note that p, , and are subscripted by t simply because the observed relative frequencies (drawn from the Bernoulli distribution) may vary from replication to the next.

4.2. Estimating the Utility Model Our framework suggests that consumers learn about the association between goal achievement and the presence of an unfamiliar attribute, and thus they update their estimate of its importance weight (and thus utility). Under Equation (12) we expect their utility estimates associated with the presence of an attribute (relative to its absence), EU x = 1 - EU x = 0 , to equal the estimated contingency, ^1 1 - ^1 0, times the utility of goal achievement, UY , which is $100 in our experiments. To examine the proposed contingency to utility transformation, we fit

where EU is the subject's estimate of the change

that the utility model proposed in Equation (12) pre-

Equation (15) using a mixed linear model that also

allows for a subject-specific random effect (with vari-

ance

As with the association regressions, we accommodate

replication-specific error variances by allowing them

to vary over replication in the following manner:

5. Results
There are four stages to our main analysis. First, we fit our four models (and the "combined" model represented by Equation (6)) to examine whether we observe departures from rational updating in the noise condition. We then compare the fit of our models to alternative models also motivated by the literature, aiming for at least comparable fit, while maintaining simplicity, completeness, and nesting. Next, we examine the implications of learning about associations and contingencies for importance weight formation, using the utility model in Equation (12). Finally, we test the predictive ability of our models.
5.1. Fitting the Basic Models The estimation results from fitting Models 2­4 and the combined model are presented in Table 3. We first note that the results associated with Model 1 are not included in the table. Recall that this model assumes that the subject approaches the problem as a statistician and that her perceived associations are therefore the relative frequencies of goal­attribute co-occurrences observed in the data; there are no other model parameters to estimate. Comparing these observed relative frequencies to directly elicited estimates gives a Model 1 log likelihood (LL) of -14 028 for the case of x = 1 ( 1 1 and -14 076 for the case of x = 0 ( 1 0 .
For all models in Table 3, we see evidence of random effects for subjects ( 2 > 0). In all cases, variance also decreases as the association increases (c1 < 0) and as the consumer gathers more information over time (r1 < 0). All models provide an improvement in fit over the model of the consumer as statistician. To gain further insight, we examine the models individually.
Biased Learning. Looking at the estimates for Model 2, we see that allowing subjects to learn to a probability of goal achievement other than the true frequency can improve fit. For x = 1 for low associations, consumers actually overlearn the value of the attribute (p1 > 1), but this effect decreases with increasing probability (p2 < 1) until finally consumers underlearn (p = 1 at f1 1 = 1 - 1 21 / -0 28 = 0 75). This seems to be consistent with Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) observation in prospect theory that consumers overestimate low-probability events but underestimate high-probability ones. However, the effect is not observed in the absence of the attribute: for x = 0, no significant bias in learning is observed.

Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses. The significance of p1 and 1 are tested relative to 1.0. The Model 1 log likelihood is -14 028 for 1 1 and -14 076 for 1 0; the associated Model 1 BIC is 28,063 for 1 1 and 28,160 for 1 0. The number of observations for all models is 3,240.
Denotes significance at the 10% level; denotes significance at the 5% level; and denotes significance at the 1% level.

Prior Beliefs. Models incorporating prior beliefs also improve fit relative to the base model. Looking at the values of in Table 3 (corresponding to Equation (3)), we see that in both cases they are close to 0.5. That is, the subject starts the experiment with approximately a 50/50 prior that the product (with or without the attribute) will allow her to achieve her goal. This finding is remarkably robust, not just across all models in the noise experiment, but with the two additional experiments reported in §6 as well (no-noise and multiple attributes). Also of interest is , the strength of priors (in terms of the number of information pairs or equivalent sample size). At f1 1 = 0, the value of 1 suggests that it takes approximately 3.5 pieces of information for x = 1 and 7.3 for x = 0 for learning to outweigh prior beliefs. (The differences between these two numbers becomes insignificant when the effect of relative frequency 2 is considered.) Unlike for priors, the effect of the level of association on learning is not strong, with 2 being insignificant for x = 1 and only marginally significant for x = 0.

Order Effects: Recency and Primacy. The order effects model also improves fit relative to the base model, but not as much as the bias or priors models. For both x = 1 and x = 0, is significantly greater than 1, suggesting a recency effect, rather than primacy (consistent with uncertainty about whether the association might change during the process). Again, the level of association does not appear as a determinant of the order effect, with 2 not being statistically significant for either value of x.
Combined Model: Biased Learning, Priors, and Order. The most comprehensive model incorporates bias, priors, and order effects; see Equation (6). This has the best fit in Table 3 with respect to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for both x = 1 and x = 0. Bias is again greater than 1 but decreasing for x = 1 with a crossover point from overlearning to underlearning at f1 1 = 0 81, similar to that of the bias model. The values of prior means ( ) again fall close to 50/50. The strength of the prior beliefs ( 1 is only marginally significant, and again, they are not contingent on the level of association 2. (If we omit 2

559

from the combined model, 1 becomes considerably more significant. However, we decided to report the complete model because the results are very similar.) Again, order effects are statistically significant, with
1 being significantly different from 1 for x = 1 and 2 being statistically significant for x = 0, driving beyond 1 for quite low levels of association. In summary, in this context consumers are not best represented as statisticians (Model 1). Their learning about attribute­goal associations exhibits bias (Model 2), the effects of prior beliefs (Model 3), and order effects (Model 4). A combination of all three components appears to fit the data at least comparably to those with only one of the phenomena included. The trade-off between parsimony and improved fit appears to favor more complete models, particularly the incorporation of priors, which gives the greatest single reduction in log likelihood. We note that bias is the only component that is consistently related to the level of association (and this is for the case of x = 1).

5.2. Comparative Fit Relative to

Benchmark Models

Whereas the previous results show that our models

capture consumers' departures from rational learning

in a simple and well-grounded way, other researchers

have chosen different functional representations to

describe some of these phenomena. We need to show

that our models do not lead to a substantial loss of

explanatory power relative to them.

For an alternative view of bias, we assume that

rather than misclassifying a constant proportion of

the

outcomes

(

,

the

sub-

ject

misclassifies

a

(

+ f1t

1).

We also allow for bias to be a function of relative fre-

quency in the alternative formulation: P = P1 + P2f1t 1. For the incorporation of priors, we use a partial

adjustment model in which the subject updates her

estimate each period by a proportion, D, of the differ-

ence between the information she is seeing and her

previous estimate:

^t
1

1

=

f1t

1

+

D

- f1t 1 . This lat-

ter model is popular in economics (e.g., Kennan 1979)

and also in psychology in the form of error reduction

models (Lopez et al. 1998a), though it lacks the sim-

ple beta-Bernoulli properties of our proposed model.

Again, we allow for updating rate to be a function of

the relative frequency: D = D1 + D2f1t 1. Finally, for an alternative way to represent order

effects, we weight sample observations by the time

since they were observed, (t - i), raised to a constant

power (e.g., Lovett 1998):

^t
1

1

=

t i=1

xi

yi

t-i+1

L

t i=1

xi

t-i+1

L

We allow L to vary as a function of frequency: L = L1 + L2f1t 1.
The estimation results for these alternative models are given in Table 4, along with the fit of our proposed models from Table 3 for comparison.
For the bias model, discounting by an absolute amount rather than a proportion of goal realizations seems to provide a slightly better representation of the data.8 However, the difference is small, and we prefer the behavioral interpretation of our model. For the alternative models of priors and order effects, the fits are not as good as those of our proposed models according to the BIC criterion.
5.3. From Probabilities to Utilities Having collected measures of both probabilities and utilities, we can also examine the probability to utility transformation. We estimate Equation (15), noting that the utility model proposed in Equation (12) predicts that = 0 and = UY = 100. In the second column of Table 5, we use the actual frequencies that subjects saw to predict their reported utilities. In column 3, we use their elicited probabilities, whereas in columns 4, 5, 6, and 7, we use the fitted probabilities from the bias, prior, order effects, and combined models, respectively. In all cases, the significance of 2 suggests that there are significant differences between subjects. Also, the significant negative coefficient of r1 in all of the regressions suggests that the accuracy with which the subject translates her associations into a utility also improves over replications. For most models, the intercept is not significantly different from 0. Although in none of the cases do subjects totally value the attribute as much as the probability or their estimate of the probability suggests that they should ( is significantly less than 100), it is interesting that this effect is least for our two models that fit the consumers' association evolution using bias and priors.9 Whereas reported probabilities explain perceived utilities better than estimated ones, three of our models of associations provide a better fit to utility than actual associations, suggesting some internal consistency to our approach.
5.4. Predictive Ability and Parameter Stability The final test of our models is to examine their predictive ability. Our approach may be useful to managers
8 This is not surprising because the inclusion of P2 indirectly provides a form of proportional bias similar to p1 in our proposed model and thus subsumes it. Note that the P2 component is considerably more significant than P1. 9 There are a number of reasons why utility as measured by willingness to pay might be somewhat lower than the expected utility calculated from ( 1 1 - 1 0 UY , the major one being risk aversion. These differences are surprisingly small except for the elicited probabilities case (column 3), which appears to be an anomaly.

in two major ways. First, if the manager understands the drivers of importance weight formation (i.e., what influences the rate at which it progresses and the level to which it asymptotes), she may direct her marketing actions to accelerate and accentuate it. Second, an understanding of attribute utility evolution may be useful in predicting the ultimate demand for a product for planning purposes. We do not manipulate the learning environment, so we cannot test different managerial strategies. However, we can test our models' predictive accuracy. To ascertain our models' predictive accuracy, we truncate our data after the ninth replication, reestimate the models, and test their predictions of subjects' reports for replications 10, 11, and 12, giving us one-, two-, and three-step-ahead forecasts. This approach provides the added benefit of testing the stability of our approach over different estimation periods.
The results of fitting replications 1 to 9 are very similar to those for replications 1 to 12 in Table 3. They are presented in Table B1 in Web Appendix B. For example, just looking at the combined model, individual response variance 2 is again significant, as are the frequency and replication effects on the variance. For x = 1, the subject again starts with overlearning but moves to underlearning at higher frequencies (with the crossover point being f1 1 = 0 88). Again, bias is not so strong in the absence of the attribute. For x = 1, prior and order (recency) effects are again significant but are not frequency dependent.
In terms of forecasting ability, the one-, two-, and three-step-ahead average forecast errors using the combined model are 7.92, 9.46, and 9.25 for x = 1, respectively, and 8.30, 9.49, and 10.20 for x = 0. (By way of reference, remember that we are modeling associations that range from 0 to 100. The average absolute errors for subjects' self-stated associations are 9.58 for x = 1 and 10.82 for x = 0. Thus, the model leads to an average of a 10.55% decrease in forecast error.10)
6. Illustrative Extensions
The modeling and calibration framework that we developed in §§3 and 4, and tested in §5, lends itself to a number of extensions. We present two of these to illustrate how the framework might be used in alternative contexts. The first relates to the data generation process. We examine whether learning occurs differently if there is no noise in the observations subjects see. The second relaxes the assumption that there is only one diagnostic attribute about which the

consumer can learn. We look specifically at the twoattribute case.
6.1. Estimation of the Models Using a Stimulus with No Noise
In the second experiment, all goal realizations were generated at the mean association, rather than drawn from a distribution. Experiment 2 enables us to compare the results between subjects learning in an environment with no noise to those who learn with noise. For example, Kahn and Meyer (1991) suggest that random noise obscures the consistency of the underlying stimulus, meaning that in unfamiliar categories, one might see greater departures from rational decision making. Most experiments in psychology present associations to subjects at their expected level of occurrence. That is, if the association of a stimulus and an outcome is 0.75, subjects always see three outcomes for every four occurrences of the stimulus. The studies by Lopez et al. (1998a, b) are but two of the many examples. This approach is inconsistent with most assumed data-generating processes where a subject is considered to take draws from a distribution. If the expected co-occurrence between the presence of an attribute and the achievement of a goal is 0.75, then according to the Bernoulli distribution in four sample realizations, 32% of the time we would except to see four co-occurrences, while 0.4% of the time, we would expect to see none. In the no-noise experiment, subjects always saw three co-occurrences (in keeping with traditional approaches), in contrast to the noise experiment where we used the association to generate sample realizations drawing from a Bernoulli distribution.
The ranges of associations studied and results for the no-noise experiment are given in Tables C1­C3 in Web Appendix C. In summary, the fits of the various no-noise models for associations are remarkably similar to those for the noise condition (as given in Table 3), which is a source of comfort for traditional approaches. (Note that it is not possible to estimate the order model on the no-noise data because there is no difference between the stimuli the subject sees in each replication of the experiment.) The parameters are almost identical and the only major difference (unsurprisingly) is the degree of fit, which is better for the no-noise experiment. As with the noise experiment, random effects and contingencyand replication-specific variances are all significant. Again for x = 1, the subject goes from overlearning to underlearning with respect to bias. Priors effects are in evidence for x = 1 but are not significantly related to association levels. Again, incoming priors are relatively close to 0.5. The results for the association to utility transformation are also similar to those in Table 5 with the exception that with no noise, the

combined and prior models are not statistically different from that predicted by Equation (12) (i.e., there is no undervaluation of attributes). It would therefore appear that when noise is added to the signal of a product attribute's efficacy in achieving a goal, consumers make larger errors in determining associations (but they still learn to the same degree), and they do not make the association to utility link perfectly.
6.2. Extension to the Two-Attribute Case To date, we have studied only one active attribute because the separability assumption suggests that it is often possible to examine consumer learning of attribute importances one at a time. There are two reasons why this might not be a good assumption. First, even if the effect of any attribute on the attainment of a goal is independent of the level of others, the cognitive complexity of learning about more than any one attribute at a time may interfere with the learning of others. For example, an attribute that has a high contingency with goal attainment may mask the effect of, and decrease the incentive to learn about, a less effective attribute. This phenomenon is well documented in psychology in terms of cue interference, including overshadowing (where a strongly salient attribute masks learning about a weakly salient one; e.g., see Price and Yates 1993) and blocking (where initial learning about one attribute goal association prevents learning about the association of another; e.g., see Chapman and Robbins 1990).
Second, the effects of different attributes may not be independent. For example, Shanks et al. (1998) examine the case of configural learning, where participants learn about the association of a combination of attributes with a goal but do not learn about individual attributes on their own. Most modeling applications in marketing assume independence of the effect of different attributes on the utility function. However, the case of correlated effects is an important one. Kayande et al. (2007) show how correlated attribute effects may influence not only the expected value obtained but also the certainty with which the consumer evaluates a product.
In this section we extend our study in an illustrative way to the case of two attributes, x and z, both of which are diagnostic in determining the utility of the product. (Remember that in the main study we did have two attributes, but the level of the second attribute did not influence the probability of goal achievement.) We consider both uncorrelated- and correlated-attribute cases.
Modeling Utility with More Than One Attribute. In the case of two binary attributes, x and z, the consumer is faced with four possible product combinations. If we denote the probability of goal attainment

or not in the presence of x and z by y xz, then to estimate the utility of a product with different attribute combinations, our framework suggests that the consumer must form estimates of 1 11, 1 10, 1 01, and 1 00 (where, for example, 1 01 represents the probability of goal achievement when x = 0 and z = 1). If we assume that the consumer is a cognitive miser (Fiske and Taylor 1991) and she also understands the value of an attribute in terms of the extent to which it helps her in achieving a salient goal times the value of that goal (Equation (12)), then the easiest way for her to assess the value of an attribute is to first estimate the four conditional probabilities above separately. In the multiattribute case, learning about associations may be slower, may lead to increased bias, or may cause order effects to be more pronounced than singleattribute learning, but we would expect Equations (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) to still pertain.
We note that when 1 11 = 1 10 and 1 01 = 1 00, the level of z does not affect goal attainment. Attribute z is diagnostic, but its effect is independent of that of x when 1 11 - 1 01 = 1 10 - 1 00 and 1 11 = 1 10. Dependence is said to exist when 1 11 - 1 01 = 1 10 - 1 00.
In terms of the association to utility transformation, the separable multiattribute utility Equation (13) applies in the case of independent attributes. In the case of correlated effects, we would expect to see an interaction effect. By substituting different values for x and z in the expression for expected utility, we may readily see that the generalized two-attribute version of Equation (13) can be written as follows:

EU x z = 0 + xx + zz + xzxz

(16)

where 0 = 1 00UY , x = 1 10 - 1 00 UY , z = 1 01 - 1 00 UY , and xz = 1 11 - 1 10 - 1 01 + 1 00 UY . We note from the above discussion that when z is diagnostic but its effect is independent of x, xz = 0, and therefore Equation (16) collapses to the separable utility Equation (13).
Testing the Two-Attribute Model. We tested the two-attribute model in an analogous setting to that described in §4. We used the same product and same two attributes (Neural Net and Temporally Continuous for x and z, respectively), except in this case, we allowed the latter to also affect the probability of goal achievement. We tested four conditions, illustrated in Table 6. Condition 1 acts as a control to establish comparability with the main experiment. The level of z does not affect goal attainment, and thus it is equivalent to condition 6 in Table 2. In conditions 2 and 3, z is diagnostic (i.e., it does influence the probability of goal achievement), but its effect is independent of that of x. In condition 2, x has a high contingency

( 1 10 - 1 00 = 0 5), while in condition 3, it is moderate ( 1 10 - 1 00 = 0 25). In condition 4, the independence assumption is relaxed ( 1 11 - 1 01 = 0 25 = 1 10 - 1 00 = 0 5). We had 30 subjects for the control condition and 45 for each of the remaining three test conditions.
Results of Fitting the Two-Attribute Model. We examine the results of fitting the two-attribute model in two stages. First, we examine the learning of associations to see whether the rate or level of associative learning is different in the cases of a diagnostic uncorrelated or correlated second attribute. In view of its strong performance in §5, we only fit the combined model.
After fitting the associative learning model, we proceed to examine the association to utility transformation to see whether its nature is affected by the presence of the second attribute. We are unable to pool across associations, as was the case in §5, and so we have considerably fewer degrees of freedom. To increase our statistical power, we pooled the four associations in each condition ( 1 11, 1 10, 1 01, 1 00 , assuming they share the same learning parameters.
Table 7 presents the two-attribute analog to Table 3. Association-specific parameters (c1, c2, p2, 2, and 2 are not relevant because we do not estimate across associations. Random effects and replication-specific variables are again statistically significant. In the highassociation conditions (control, high, and correlated), we see underlearning as expected, whereas in the low-association condition, we do not. The effect sizes are similar to those of learning with one attribute. However, whereas priors and their updating are still significant, the amount of information needed to overcome priors in the more complex information environment is higher ( is larger). Order effects are only significant for the uncorrelated high-association condition, a fact that may be due to the decreased statistical power of our test here.
The association to utility transformation calibration results are presented in Table 8, and it is here that the surprise really comes. Whereas random effects and replication variances are consistent with those in Table 5, estimates of the intercept ( ) and

slope parameters of contingency ( ) are considerably changed. The intercept is now highly significant and the effect of contingency on utility is strongly diminished from its rational value of 100. These multiattribute examples are positioned as illustrative because of the wide range of associations and correlations that could have been investigated, but they do seem to provide strong circumstantial evidence that with more than one diagnostic attribute, the consumer has less trouble in determining whether an attribute is useful in accomplishing her goal and more difficulty in deciding how to value the attribute based on that association. If that is the case more broadly, this has obvious implications for communications strategies. A brand with one new attribute may be able to establish its efficacy and hence utility based on these results. Where two new attributes offer increased utility, the manager's communication problem may be less about establishing the usefulness of the attributes

in achieving a goal and more about showing the consumer why that usefulness should lead to a higher valuation. This is consistent with popular advertising lore, which suggests that the advertiser should aim to own a single attribute in the customer's mind (e.g., Ries and Trout 1994).
7. Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper we developed and tested a set of models of binary attribute importance weight formation. We interpreted attribute importance in terms of an associative relationship between a consumer's goal and a product attribute, and we modeled the learning of these relations based on the classical conditioning process. Our models of importance weight evolution, motivated by Lancaster (1966), allow us to separate attribute importance into properties intrinsic to consumer's goal and those relating to the attribute's

incremental ability to achieve that goal. In our application, we control the subjects' goal and allow them to learn the attribute's ability to satisfy it.
We tested for the existence of different learning phenomena using our models. We find that consumers may have prior expectations about the importance of unfamiliar product attributes in a new product category but will revise them in the face of evidence, though often to an equilibrium position not exactly equal to that of a rational decision maker. We also observe overall recency effects in our particular application. Our representation is parsimonious, is linked directly to multiattribute utility theory, and fits at least comparably to alternative formulations previously proposed to (separately) look at other forms of learning. We find that an attribute's importance evolution depends on the association between its presence and the achievement of a goal. Similar results pertain in environments in which there is no noise

(and, not surprisingly, these models tend to fit the data better than in the case of noise). We also illustrated our models in the case of learning about more than one active attribute. We found similar results for associative learning but much weaker evidence of that association being translated into utility judgments. In other applications the relative importance of these phenomena may be different.
The implications for researchers of having a methodology to determine importance weights over time is that it enables them to understand one important aspect of preference and choice dynamics for products with new attributes. For managers, our approach provides a method of calibrating likely equilibrium attribute importance and how that importance will evolve once consumers' goals have been uncovered using market research. It will be useful for prelaunch studies where it is realistic to expose consumers to multiple realizations of their goal outcomes in the presence of the product. However, it may also be used postlaunch to track attribute valuation based on consumers' experience with the product. It could also be combined with choice-based conjoint analysis to study one aspect of the dynamics of choice.11
Our research does make assumptions that bring with them a number of limitations. Our main experiment relied on a single, stable, and well-defined consumer goal, and all three experiments used binary product attributes in a new product category. This scenario is useful for demonstrating the key predictions of the models and examining the role of different levels of association. Moreover, the case of binary attributes is prevalent in many new product markets. The generalizability of our approach to situations involving multilevel predictor attributes, as well as competing and/or fuzzy consumer goals, can be undertaken with further research. For example, the importance weights of continuous attributes could be represented by the effect of sample realizations of different levels and the achievement (or partial achievement) of goals using continuous Bayesian conjugate pairs. Phenomena beyond bias, priors, and order effects could also be incorporated into our models. Also, it would be useful to study how consumer learning varies as associations change (for example, an attribute becomes more efficacious as a result of quality improvements) or when there is serial autocorrelation (successes and failures tend to come in runs).
A natural extension of the research would be to investigate the effect of different interventions on learning so that the models could be used not only to estimate importance weight evolution but also to test different management strategies to influence it. As a

first step, what we have done is to develop and apply a simple set of utility learning models that captures a number of key phenomena in binary importance weight evolution and which allows us to assess the presence of different phenomena, test their forecasting ability, and see how they vary with association level under two data-generating processes.
