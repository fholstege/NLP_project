Abstract. Firms are increasingly using technology to enable targeted, or "personalized," pricing strategies. In settings where prices are transparent to all consumers, however, there is the potential for interpersonal price differences to be perceived as inherently unfair. In response, firms may strategically obfuscate their prices so that direct interpersonal comparisons are more difficult. The feasibility of such a pricing strategy is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which it is profitable for firms to engage in price obfuscation, given the potential fairness concerns of consumers. We study how price obfuscation affects consumer fairness concerns, consumer demand, and equilibrium pricing strategies. The findings suggest that if obfuscation mitigates fairness concerns, it can arise as an equilibrium outcome, even if consumers are aware of the seller's strategic behavior and are able to update their beliefs and expectations about the prices offered to their peers accordingly. To test the theoretical predictions, an experiment is conducted in which price obfuscation is varied both exogenously and endogenously. The results confirm that buyers have intrinsic distributional (based on the seller's margins) and peer-induced fairness (due to others being charged different prices) concerns when prices are transparent. In particular, disadvantaged peer-induced fairness concerns enter utility as an intrinsic cost that the seller has to compensate for through lower prices. Obfuscation effectively reduces peer-induced fairness concerns and increases sellers' pricing power. However, this pricing power is constrained by distributive inequity becoming more salient when prices are obfuscated.

1. Introduction
Retailers are increasingly turning to price personalization as a way to move consumers away from nontargeted mass discounts in order to improve their profit margins. In a recent survey, 64% of U.S. retailers agreed that "it will become important to deliver personalized prices to shoppers in the next three years,"(Retail Systems Research 2017, p. 14), a significant increase from the prior year. However, many retailers realize that implementing a personalized pricing strategy can result in blowback if consumers find out about different prices being offered to other consumers. This was highlighted in an incident when users discovered that Amazon.com charged some customers more than others for the same products.

Faced with furious responses from consumers and the press, Amazon halted the practice and apologized for the `unfair' treatment (Weiss 2000). Peer-induced fairness (PIF) concerns, that is, consumers disliking paying a different price than their peers for the same good, are at the core of retailer fears and a major constraint in successful implementation of such personalized pricing strategies (e.g., Darke and Dahl 2003, Xia et al. 2004, Ho and Su 2009, Li and Jain 2015).
Aware of these fairness concerns, many large retailers are exploring different ways to obfuscate (i.e., make less transparent) the practice of personalized pricing. In this paper, we define price obfuscation as a purposeful action taken by a price-discriminating seller to prevent buyers from observing prices offered

to other buyers for the same good. For example, Sam's Club introduced checkout apps that deliver individual prices without other customers noticing. In addition, Kroger is piloting a project called "digital shelf edge," which uses in-store sensors and analytics to provide product recommendations and custom pricing discreetly through mobile devices. Similarly, Amazon is engaged in highly sophisticated personalized pricing through individualized coupons and price fluctuations across time designed to get as close as possible to first-degree price discrimination without consumers noticing that final prices shown to them might be different from those shown to others. These examples illustrate the tension that retailers face between optimizing their price personalization strategies and consumer fairness concerns.
The feasibility of such a pricing system rests on the successful obfuscation of prices across customers in order to make their interpersonal price comparisons difficult. In other words, retailers are expending great effort not only to offer a consumer the optimal personalized price, but also to obfuscate the prices offered to other consumers. In this paper, we investigate how the strategic obfuscation of prices across buyers affects consumer fairness concerns, consumer demand, and equilibrium pricing strategies. The goal of this paper is to answer the following four research questions:
1. When consumers are uncertain about the valuations/ prices offered to their peers, under what conditions are firm profits higher when prices are obfuscated versus when they are transparent?
2. How do optimal prices vary when pricing is obfuscated versus when it is transparent? Moreover, what happens to the corresponding consumer surplus?
3. Can price obfuscation be sustained as an equilibrium outcome if consumers are aware that the seller is strategically (endogenously) choosing to obfuscate prices and are able to update their beliefs and expectations about the prices offered to other buyers accordingly?
4. Is price obfuscation effective at mitigating consumer fairness concerns?
To answer these questions, we develop a game theoretic model of a seller facing two buyers who exhibit both distributive fairness (DF) and PIF concerns. The former captures a consumer's intrinsic concern about excessive retail margins; the later captures concerns about paying a different price than other buyers. The two buyers have different valuations/ willingness to pay (WTP) for the seller's good and are capable of forming rational expectations regarding the optimal pricing strategy. The seller observes both buyers' WTP and can offer different prices accordingly, that is, price discriminate. We analyze three games: (1) an exogenous transparency game, where

each buyer always observes both prices; (2) an exogenous obfuscation game, where each buyer observes only his own price but not that of the other buyer; and (3) an endogenous obfuscation game, where the seller sets the prices and decides whether they will be transparent or obfuscated, that is, the seller decides whether each buyer can or cannot observe the price offered to the other buyer. In the endogenous obfuscation case, the buyers are aware of the sellers' transparency or obfuscation decision and rationally update their beliefs accordingly.
The theoretical model predicts that the seller's profit and equilibrium prices under exogenous obfuscation will be higher than under exogenous transparency when differences in buyers' WTP are high. If PIF concerns are equally strong under obfuscation and transparency, then obfuscation cannot be sustained in equilibrium in the endogenous obfuscation game. When consumers are aware that the seller strategically chose obfuscation, they will expect the highest level of price discrimination possible, which ends up making it optimal for the seller to choose transparency. This means that although obfuscation can be more profitable than transparency when imposed exogenously, it can fail to materialize in equilibrium once consumers consider that the seller is engaging in it strategically.
Notably, the theoretical model suggests that if obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns, it can arise as an equilibrium outcome, even if consumers are aware of the sellers' strategic behavior. The seller will still find obfuscation more profitable than transparency when the difference in WTP is sufficiently high, even though consumers can use this information to update their beliefs about the prices offered to their peers and the seller's price-discrimination strategy. Finally, if obfuscation completely eliminates the PIF concerns but increases DF concerns by attention shifting, the same predictions hold.
We test the predictions of the theoretical model of strategic obfuscation through a two-sided experiment in which subjects play the role of either a pricediscriminating seller or a utility-maximizing buyer. A controlled experiment provides the ability to separate consumer fairness from other confounding factors (reciprocity, betrayal, altruism, etc.) present in transactional data. In particular, in our experiment, buyers decide whether to accept the price offered by the seller, while the level of interpersonal price transparency is varied both exogenously and endogenously. We impose exogenous price obfuscation by allowing subjects to have two theoretical extremes in price transparency: complete knowledge of what others were offered or no peer price information at all. Endogenous price obfuscation is examined by allowing the seller to pay to obscure prices between buyers, so both the level of obfuscation

124

and prices are endogenously determined. We use an incentive-compatible design so that the participants' actual monetary payments are directly proportional to the surplus they accumulate during the experiment.
Next, we use the experimental data to test the theoretical predictions using either simple mean comparisons or reduced form regressions. Notably, the results suggest strong statistical support for nine theoretical results related to equilibrium prices, consumer surplus, profits, and obfuscation/transparency decisions. In other words, we find strong model-free support that the observed pricing strategies as well as the endogenous obfuscation/transparency decisions are consistent with our theoretical equilibrium predictions. Because we have a two-sided game and strategic behavior on both sides, we use an econometric model to account for the buyer and seller decisions simultaneously. This allows us to estimate the magnitude and direction of the inequity aversion parameters and further test our theory.
We find that peer-induced fairness concerns are an important obstacle to charging personalized prices, but obfuscation can help sellers mitigate buyers' aversion to inequity. This result holds even when they are aware that the seller is doing so. The results also suggest that when prices are obfuscated, the buyer's attention shifts to how the total surplus is divided between the seller and the buyer (i.e., distributional inequity concerns), which adds a constraint for effective price discrimination even when peer prices are effectively concealed.
This study contributes to both the theoretical and empirical literature on price fairness by explaining how strategic obfuscation can be sustained as an equilibrium strategy by a price-discriminating seller to ameliorate buyers' peer-induced concerns even when buyers know that the seller is practicing price discrimination. To this point, the literature on interpersonal perceptions of price fairness has taken price transparency/obfuscation as exogenously given. However, sellers are able to invest in technologies that ensure prices are targeted to individual buyers and make interpersonal price comparisons more difficult. Our theoretical and empirical model explicitly considers the effect of these seller decisions on equilibrium prices. Furthermore, whereas the mechanisms that underlie perceptions of price fairness are by now relatively well understood (Xia et al. 2004), there is little research on how these perceptions manifest in purchase decisions, or the optimal seller response. However, there is evidence that equilibrium prices are likely to be different if rational sellers take into account the fact that inequity-averse buyers may not purchase if they think they are being taken advantage of (Anderson and Simester 2008, Rotemberg 2011). Our findings on the decision to obfuscate add another level of realism

to the theoretical fairness literature and its practical importance. Finally, this study provides empirical evidence that obfuscation can mitigate PIF concerns by making prices paid by other consumers less salient.
2. Related Literature
Perhaps because of its fundamental importance to the viability of any pricing system, price fairness has assumed a prominent place in marketing, psychology, and economics research (Xia et al. 2004, Cui et al. 2007, Rotemberg 2011, Goldfarb et. al. 2012, Li and Jain 2015). Although this may pose a threat to a successful personalized pricing strategy, our paper shows that obfuscation can lead to higher equilibrium prices compared with a transparent setting. This study is unique, as it links two distinct streams of literature on fairness concerns and strategic obfuscation, which we summarize in this section.
2.1. Fairness Although there are many ways consumers form perceptions of price fairness, we primarily focus on interpersonal comparisons, as our objective is to study the viability of price-discrimination regimes that rely on interpersonal differences in prices. There is a wealth of empirical evidence that interpersonal comparisons are particularly important in forming perceptions of price fairness. In particular, Darke and Dahl (2003) sought to explain why consumers seem to place unusual value in obtaining a bargain. Framing their analysis in terms of equity theory (Adams 1965, Bagozzi 1975, Oliver and Swan 1989) and transaction utility theory (Thaler 1985), they found that learning another customer received a better deal had a much larger impact on satisfaction than the direct effects of the bargain participants received themselves. Haws and Bearden (2006) compared the effects of different modes of price comparison on perceptions of fairness and found that interpersonal price differences resulted in the greatest perceptions of unfairness. Similarly, when the only comparisons were between the buyer's own past price and another buyer's price, Xia and Monroe's (2010) results suggested that the price paid by someone else had a much stronger influence on the perception of unfairness. More recently, Ashworth and McShane (2012) conducted two studies in the laboratory to investigate whether interpersonal differences in price led to feelings of "disrespect" from the seller and whether those feelings were associated with comparisons with others buying from the same store or at a regular or discounted price. Perhaps not surprisingly, their results show that buyers consider themselves disrespected if they are charged a higher price compared with another consumer. This effect is exacerbated if the comparison is made within store, and for the same

type of item. In our paper, the concept of interpersonal price differences takes center stage. As we explain in our theoretical model and the empirical application of the model below, these interpersonal price differences and the anticipations of fairness concerns drive sellers' pricing decisions and determine the sellers' incentives to invest in making the prices less transparent.
It is important that PIF is considered separately from DF, which deals with how total transaction surplus is distributed between buyers and sellers. The distinction is important because concerns regarding both types of fairness stem from different behavioral mechanisms. In the case of DF, the dual entitlement theory of Kahneman et al. (1986a, b) implies that, in their relationships with sellers, buyers are motivated by a sense that both sides of the transaction are entitled to at least some of the transaction surplus. Their theory maintains that buyers' perceptions of price fairness are governed by the notion that firms are expected to earn a reference level of profit, and buyers expect to pay a reference price. If buyers believe that a price increase is driven by a higher demand--a snowstorm raising the demand for shovels--then the price is more likely to be viewed as unfair compared with an increase in the cost of manufacturing the shovels, for example. Our theoretical model assumes that one can measure the DF, and our experiment is designed to isolate the effects of the DF mechanism from PIF on the consumer's choice. Our paper also shows the interdependence between the peer-induced fairness and the DF and how both of them are affected by peer price obfuscation; namely, we show that when prices are obfuscated, buyers shift their attention from caring about the PIF to caring relatively more about DF.
Several studies investigate how distributional and/ or PIF concerns influence economic outcomes in a supply chain (Cui et al. 2007, Ho et al. 2014, Cui and Mallucci 2016). Two studies, by Ho and Su (2009) and Ho et al. (2014), analyze a setting where both types of fairness concerns, PIF and DF, are present. They focus on a leader (e.g., manufacturer) who makes ultimatum offers sequentially to identical followers (e.g., retailers or employees). Their work empirically disentangles PIF and DF concerns, highlights how PIF concerns limit price discrimination, and shows that PIF concerns cause the second follower to get a better offer than the first. There are two important differences between their studies and ours. First, their sequential framework applies primarily to business-tobusiness transactions or negotiations. In contrast, our simultaneous framework is better suited to study business-to-consumer transactions. Second, they treat the level of obfuscation as exogenously given and do not investigate the interaction between strategic (endogenous) obfuscations and PIF concerns. To our knowledge,

no previous study focuses on how a seller's strategic obfuscation decision affects buyers' perceptions of price fairness and their subsequent purchase behavior.
2.2. Obfuscation Ignorance as a source of market power has been well understood since Scitovsky (1950). If firms are able to make price comparisons difficult or costly, they will be more likely to sell to buyers unwilling, or unable, to form expectations of what constitutes a reasonable price. In other words, if price transparency does indeed represent a significant barrier to a firm's ability to price discriminate, then obfuscating prices represents a potential source of market power and should yield higher equilibrium prices.
The term obfuscation has been used previously in the literature to refer to a variety of purposeful actions taken by sellers to prevent consumers from comparing prices of similar products, whether across sellers, across products from the same seller, or across buyers. By whatever means, the intent of strategic obfuscation is to raise search costs, thereby creating opportunities for margin expansion (Stigler 1961). Strategic obfuscation takes many forms, from creating slightly different versions of the same product (e.g., Ellison 2005, Gabaix and Laibson 2006, Ellison and Ellison 2009) to creating confusion in how prices are reported to consumers (e.g., Carlin 2009, Wilson 2010, Wilson and Price 2010, Chioveanu and Zhou 2013, Muir et al. 2013), or to the personalized pricing examples discussed above. In this paper, we focus on a particular type of strategic obfuscation, namely, the purposeful action taken by a price-discriminating seller to prevent buyers from observing prices offered to other buyers for the same good. The purpose of this kind of obfuscation is to reduce their ability to compare prices across different buyers accurately. In our model, sellers can either choose between transparency or obfuscation of prices. The former (latter) corresponds to making buyers' search costs infinite (zero).
There is some empirical evidence that strategic obfuscation can be profit enhancing under the right circumstances. In the context of online shopping, Ellison and Ellison (2009) show that price obfuscation strategies, such as not showing the retail price in the search results, can yield higher equilibrium profits because they give more monopoly power to firms by increasing search frictions and making consumers less informed. Similarly, Blake et al. (2017) document that obfuscation of shipping and handling fees led to a revenue boost for StubHub.com. They show that part of this effect is due to higher search costs making comparisons across substitute products more difficult. In this paper, on the other hand, we allow firms to obfuscate interpersonal price comparisons while

126

buyers are fully aware of the transparency versus obfuscation decision. That way, we can test whether obfuscation is effective at alleviating PIF concerns and raising equilibrium profits. Therefore, in our theoretical model as well as the empirical application, we capture not only perceptions of fairness and how they affect demand, but also how sellers anticipate buyers' responses in setting equilibrium prices and deciding whether to pay to obfuscate peer price offers.

3. Theoretical Model

There are two buyers, a and b, who each have a unique

willingness to pay for a good. The buyers' WTPs are

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws

from a uniform distribution on [w, w] whose cumu-

lative distribution function (CDF) is given by F(wi) wwi--ww. A seller produces the good at a constant marginal

cost, c  [0, w], which is common knowledge to all players.1 The seller observes both buyers' WTP. Each

buyer, however, knows only his own WTP, and not

that of the other buyer. The seller makes a take-it-or-

leave-it offer (price) to each buyer, who accepts if the

offer leaves him with at least the same utility as his

outside option. Without loss of generality, we nor-

malize the utility of the buyers' outside option to zero.

Let pi denote the price the seller offers buyer i, with information set i, who obtains the following utility by accepting the offer:

Negative PIF effect

where i, j  {a, b}, i j. We follow standard notation and capitalize Pj to reflect that it is a random variable from the perspective of buyer i. The first term in the equation captures the buyer's objective (obj.) surplus weighted by a parameter  > 0. The second term captures his DF concerns (i.e., how much he cares about the surplus the seller keeps for herself) weighted by  > 0. The third term captures his PIF concerns (i.e., the negative utility from another buyer getting a lower price) weighted by d > 0.2
We analyze three games: (1) an exogenous transparency game, where both prices are exogenously revealed to both buyers; (2) an exogenous obfuscation game, where each buyer only observes his own price but not that offered to the other buyer; and (3) an endogenous obfuscation game, where the seller first observes both WTPs, then endogenously decides whether to reveal or obfuscate prices. Without loss of generality, we simplify the exposition of the theoretical analysis by normalizing the constant marginal cost of producing the good, c, to zero.

Throughout the analysis, we will make use of the

following two definitions.

Definition 1.

Let

pmax(wi)



 wi +

denote

the

maximum

price a buyer with WTP wi  [w, w] would pay in the

absence of PIF concerns (i.e., if Pr(Pj < pi | i) 0 and/

or d 0).

Definition 2. Let l and h, respectively, denote the buyer
with the lower and higher WTP such that wl  min{wa,wb} and wh  max{wa, wb}.

3.1. Exogenous Transparency

In this game, each buyer observes both prices offered

by the seller. Because buyer i observes both prices,

then he knows with certainty whether pj < pi, and his utility in Equation (1) reduces to

Uitrp(wi, pi, pj)

Lemma 1. The unique equilibrium of the exogenous trans-

parency game is characterized by the following:

i. The seller charges buyer l her maximum price, but charges

buyer h a discounted price below her maximum price.

ii. Buyer h's discount (price) decreases (increases) in

buyer l's WTP; such that the discount is highest as

wl  w, and it is zero as wl  wh.

When prices are transparent, the low WTP buyer knows with certainty he is receiving the lower price. Hence, PIF concerns are absent for him, and the seller is able to charge the maximum price. Conversely, the high WTP buyer suffers a disutility due to PIF concerns because he observes that his price is higher than that of the other buyer. Thus, the seller must compensate him with a discounted price below his maximum price. The magnitude of a discount depends on the price offered to the low WTP buyer. Specifically, the lower the price (and WTP) of buyer l, the higher the discount needed for buyer h to accept the offer.

For a given wh, Figure 1(a) graphically illustrates the relationship between prices and wl (see the dashed lines representing transparent prices).

3.2. Exogenous Obfuscation

In this game, buyer i does not observe the price of-

fered to buyer j (nor wj). We assume that each buyer is capable of forming a rational expectation about the seller's pricing strategy. Therefore, the utility of a buyer will depend on her expectation about the price

offered to the other buyer (see Equation (1)). Because a buyer does not observe the other's price, the seller's

optimal price for him will depend only on his WTP

and not on that of the other buyer. In other words, the

seller's optimal price for buyer i will be a function of wi

only and not wj.

Buyers capable of forming rational expectations

should only expect the seller to price according to

a strictly increasing function, say p^(w).3 Because p^

is monotone, then its inverse, p^-1, must exist, and

Pr(p^(Wj)  pi) Pr(Wj  p^-1(pi)). The buyer's utility

from Equation (1) can now be written as

ii. The seller offers the lowest WTP buyer his maximum price (i.e., pobf (w) pmax(w)), but she charges any other buyer a discounted price below his maximum price (i.e., pobf (wi) < pmax(wi), for all wi  (w, w]).
iii. The discount increases in WTP such that the higher a buyer's WTP, the higher the objective surplus he receives.
When buyer i faces exogenous obfuscation, he cannot be certain that he received the higher or lower price. His PIF utility loss depends on two things: (1) the probability that the other buyer's WTP is below his, F(wi)  Pr(Wj < wi), and (2) his expectation of the price the other buyer received conditional on Wj < wi (see Equation (5)). In turn, the discount he receives depends on the two same things (see Equation (6)). Because the lowest WTP buyer (wi w) is certain that the other buyer's price is not lower than his, there is no discount for PIF concerns. As the buyer's WTP increases, both the probability that the other price is below his and the conditional expected price the other buyer receives increase. Therefore, the higher a buyer's WTP, the higher the discount he receives. Because buyers observe neither each other's price nor each other's WTP, the price/discount a buyer receives depends only on his own WTP, and not the other's WTP.
3.3. Comparing Exogenous Obfuscation vs. Exogenous Transparency
It is now useful to reiterate the following observations based on the previous results:
1. Under exogenous transparency, the low WTP buyer receives no discount, regardless of his WTP, because he knows with certainty that the other buyer received a higher price. In contrast, under exogenous obfuscation, the low WTP buyer receives a positive discount (for any wl  (w, w]) that increases in his own WTP.
2. Under exogenous transparency, if the WTP of the low buyer decreases, the high WTP buyer will observe a bigger gap in prices; hence, his discount will increase. In contrast, under exogenous obfuscation, if the WTP of the low buyer decreases, the high WTP buyer's expectations do not change; hence, his discount does not change.
3. Under exogenous transparency, if both buyers have equal WTPs, the seller gives neither of them a discount because they both observe that there is no price gap. In contrast, under exogenous obfuscation, the seller offers them both a discount.
Proposition 1. The difference between the seller's profits under exogenous obfuscation and exogenous transparency depends on the difference between the buyers' WTPs as follows:

of the high WTP buyer, the seller prefers exogenous

iii. The cutoff function B(wi) is increasing, such that B(w) w, B (w) 1, 0 < B (wi) < 1 for all wi  (w, w), B (w) 0, and w < B(wi) < wi for all wi  (w, w].

A good way to grasp the intuition behind the proposition above is to fix the high WTP, wh, and consider the seller's pricing strategies as the low WTP moves from the low extreme case (wl  w) to the high extreme case (wl  wh). If wl  w, the seller charges the low buyer his maximum price under both exogenous transparency and exogenous obfuscation. Under exogenous transparency, however, she will have to give the high WTP buyer the highest possible discount because he observes that buyer l received the lowest possible price (see part ii of Lemma 1). In contrast, under obfuscation, the high WTP buyer does not know for sure whether the other buyer is getting a lower price. Thus, the seller offers him a smaller discount because his PIF disutility will depend on the probability that he is the high buyer and the conditional expected price of the other buyer is below his. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 1(a), where pobf (w) ptlrp(w) and pobf (wh) > pthrp(wh, w), both of which imply that as wl  w, profit from obfuscation is higher than that from transparency.
Now, consider the opposite scenario, where wl  wh. When both buyers share the same WTP, the seller charges them both their maximum prices under exogenous transparency. The buyers will observe that they both received the same price, and the PIF disutility will no longer be a concern. In contrast, under obfuscation, neither buyer knows with certainty whether the other buyer is getting a lower, a higher, or the same price, and the seller has to offer them both a discount. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 1(a), where pobf (wh) < pmax(wh) and pthrp(wh, wh) pmax(wh), both of which imply that as wl  wh, transparency profit is higher than obfuscation profit. Figure 1(b) shows the cutoff function B(wh) that determines the critical value of wl for a given wh. If wl is sufficiently low (below B(wh)), exogenous obfuscation profits dominate transparency profits, and vice versa.

3.4. Endogenous Obfuscation
In this section, we analyze the case where the seller, after observing the two buyers' WTPs, wa and wb, endogenously chooses either price obfuscation or transparency

129

and sets the prices. As a result, buyer i  {a, b} observes the seller's obfuscation/transparency decision, and
because this decision is endogenous, he uses it to update his beliefs about the other buyer's WTP and price. Let
Iobf be a binary variable that takes the value 1 or 0, respectively, if the seller chooses obfuscation or transparency. Buyer i's utility of accepting a price pi conditional on the seller's obfuscation decision is given by

Uiend(w((iww×-,pii(i--p| iIppd-obiiP))fEr)--([PPppjj |iiP-pji|dIpmoib,faIoxb{1f 0),

pi - ])

} pj

if Iobf 0,
if Iobf 1. (8)

Note that in the obfuscation prong, d is multiplied by a parameter , which captures the degree to which
the price obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns relative
to price transparency. We conjecture that PIF con-
cerns will be weaker under obfuscation versus transparency (i.e., 0 <  < 1). There are two main reasons
for this conjecture. First, when consumers are given
less information about certain attributes, those at-
tributes become less salient to them (Reutskaja et al.
2011, Orquin and Loose 2013). In other words, if
consumers do not directly observe the prices offered
to others, PIF concerns become less salient, and the
corresponding utility weight gets diminished com-
pared with when consumers directly observe peer
prices. Second, when prices are obfuscated, buyers
need to form expectations about peer prices. In this case, a buyer's own price becomes the only anchor,
and the buyer will not adjust far enough from it when forming his expectations.5
The following stages formally summarize the game: Stage 0. Nature draws wa and wb. The seller observes both and calculates wh  max{wa, wb} and wl  min{wa, wb}. Buyer i observes wi but not wj, for all i, j  {a, b}, i j. Stage 1. Seller chooses either price obfuscation or transparency (i.e., Iobf  {0, 1}) and sets respective prices, pi and pj. Stage 2. If the seller chose transparency (Iobf 0), both buyers observe both prices. If the seller chose
obfuscation (Iobf 1), buyer i observes only pi and not pj, and updates his beliefs to calculate the posterior distribution i(Wj). This, in turn, allows him to calculate Pr(Pj  pi | Iobf 1) and E[Pj | Pj  pi, Iobf 1] for all i, j  {a, b}, i j. If Uiend  0, buyer i accepts the transaction and purchases; otherwise, he does not.
In this game, the seller is informed of both buyers' WTP, but buyers are uninformed about each other's
WTP. Because the seller endogenously chooses

whether to obfuscate, the uniformed buyers can use
this information to update their beliefs about each other's WTP. We look for a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) for this game (see Fudenberg and Tirole 1991). A PBE requires that players' strategies are op-
timal given beliefs, and that beliefs of uninformed players
are consistent with Bayesian updating. For this game,
the two requirements can be summarized as follows: 1.Optimality: Given buyers' beliefs, the seller's equi-
librium strategies must be optimal (sequentially rational). 2. Bayesian consistency: Buyers' beliefs are determined
by Bayes' rule and the seller's equilibrium strategies. The quintuplet (Iobf , peand, pebnd, a(wb), b (wb)) char-
acterizes the PBE in this game. The first term specifies the seller's equilibrium obfuscation/transparency de-
cision, the second and the third terms specify equilibrium prices, and the forth and fifth specify buyers'
equilibrium posterior beliefs after observing Iobf 1. We will present the unique PBE for this game by (i) specifying the seller's optimal obfuscation strategy regardless of buyers' beliefs, (ii) deriving the buyers'
beliefs that satisfy the Bayesian consistency require-
ment, (iii) showing that the optimal obfuscation strat-
egy from step (i) constitutes a unique PBE given buyers' Bayesian consistent beliefs, and (vi) listing the sufficient off-equilibrium beliefs that guarantee that
the seller does not have an incentive to deviate off the
equilibrium path. First, suppose the seller chooses transparency and
buyers observe both prices. Then, the utility in Equa-
tion (8) converges to the one in (1), in which case, the
game converges to the exogenous transparency game with equilibrium prices, pthrp(wh, wl) and ptlrp(wl) pmax(wl), as specified by Equation (4). From observing each other's price, buyers will be able to perfectly infer each other's WTP. Next, suppose the seller
chooses obfuscation. Buyer i will update his beliefs about buyer j's WTP (and, in turn, the price offered). For any arbitrary set of posterior beliefs, the seller's optimal pricing strategy, peobf (wi),6 will be an increasing function that satisfies Uiend(wi, peobf (wi)) 0 (see Lemma A.4 in Appendix A), such that

Unlike in the exogenous obfuscation case, when buyers observe endogenous obfuscation, they will update their beliefs regarding the other buyers' WTP and price. This is reflected in the difference between the optimal prices under endogenous versus exogenous obfuscation (Equation (6) versus Equation (9)).

The intuition is similar to that presented in Section 3.3. Whenever the difference between the WTPs of both buyers is small (large), the seller will find it optimal to choose transparency (obfuscation). The condition on  in Lemma 3 is sufficient but not necessary to ensure that the equilibrium characterized is unique. It is important to note that the

equilibrium holds regardless of this condition; how-
ever, the condition allows us to analytically prove its uniqueness as well.7 The function A defines the regions in which obfuscation is more profitable than trans-
parency (shaded areas in Figure 2(a)) and those in which transparency is more profitable (white area

Figure 2 depicts the obfuscation/transparency regions as well as buyer i's posterior beliefs (CDF) about wj. Suppose buyer i has a relatively low WTP, as represented by the vertical line at wi w1 < A(w) in Figure 2(a). When he observes obfuscation, he infers that the other buyer's WTP cannot be close to his own, that is, he is certain that wj / [A(wi), A-1(wi)], otherwise, the seller would have chosen transparency. Hence, wj must be sufficiently far from his own WTP, which can occur in either of the following two ways: (i) with some probability below 1, the other buyer's WTP is below his, such that wj < A(wi) < wi (see the bottom segment of the wi w1 line), and (ii) with the complimentary probability, the other buyer's WTP is above his, such that wj > A-1(wi) > wi (see the top segment of the wi w1 line). The posterior CDF in this case is illustrated by the top panel of Figure 2(b). In
contrast, suppose buyer i has a relatively high WTP, as represented by the vertical line at wi w2 > A(w) in Figure 2(a). He will know that even if the other buyer
draws the highest possible WTP, w, it will still be close
enough for the seller to choose transparency. There-
fore, when such a buyer observes obfuscation, he will know that the other buyer's WTP is certainly below his such that wj < A(wi) < wi (see the bottom segment of the wi w2 line). The posterior CDF is illustrated by the bottom panel of Figure 2(b). In both cases, if the other buyer's WTP is below (wj < wi), then it will be distributed uniformly on [w, A(wi)].

Proposition 2. If obfuscation does not mitigate buyers' PIF concerns (  1), then obfuscation is not sustainable in a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and the seller will always choose

131

transparency in equilibrium. If obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns (0 <  < 1), the PBE is characterized by the following:
i. The seller will choose obfuscation (transparency) if wl is sufficiently far from (close to) wh, as formally given by Equation (10).
ii. If buyer i observes obfuscation, he updates his beliefs according to Lemma 4.
iii. If the seller chooses transparency, equilibrium prices are the same as those in the exogenous transparency game in Equation (4).
iv. If the seller chooses obfuscation, the equilibrium prices are given by pend(wi) pmax(wi) - tend(wi), where

is sufficient (but not nec-

essary) to guarantee the uniqueness of this equilibrium.

If PIF concerns are as strong under obfuscation as they are under transparency, then obfuscation cannot be sustained in equilibrium. This means that although obfuscation can be more profitable to the seller when exogenously imposed,8 it can no longer be sustained in equilibrium when buyers know that she is making this decision strategically. To see why, suppose buyer i draws a high WTP: wi w2 > A(w), and his posterior CDF for wj is illustrated by the bottom panel of Figure 2(b). If buyer i observes obfuscation, he will know that buyer j is certainly getting a lower price and will form his expectations based on the belief that wj  U[w, A(wi)]. Now, suppose buyer j draws wj A(wi); thus, the seller should be indifferent between obfuscation and transparency for the equilibrium to hold. However, under obfuscation, she needs to offer a discount to buyer j (lower WTP), whereas under transparency, she does not. Moreover, she has to offer a higher discount to buyer i under obfuscation (versus transparency) because wj, in this case, is higher than the posterior expectations. In other words, whenever the buyer believes that obfuscation is optimal in some region, the seller will end up finding transparency to be optimal within some parts of that region, which violates the sequential rationality requirement of seller's strategy. Thus, there does not exist a region where obfuscation is sustained in equilibrium if PIF concerns are as strong under obfuscation as they are under transparency. In equilibrium, any buyer observing obfuscation will believe (rationally) that the other buyer

132

Allender et al: Price Fairness and Strategic Obfuscation Marketing Science, 2021, vol. 40, no. 1, pp. 122­146, © 2020 The Author(s)

has the lowest possible WTP, that is, will assume that

her price disadvantage is as high as it can get.

In contrast, if obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns,

then it can be sustained in equilibrium. There will

exist a nonempty region for which buyers will hold

the equilibrium belief that the seller will endoge-

nously choose obfuscation (as per Equation (10) and

Figure 2(a)). Given that belief, it is sequentially ra-

tional for the seller to indeed obfuscate in this region

because the mitigation of PIF concerns makes it op-

timal to do so everywhere within the obfuscation

region. Thus, in the PBE, the seller endogenously

chooses obfuscation when the difference in WTP is

sufficiently high (low), as the same dynamics of

Proposition 1 apply. When the difference in WTP is

high, transparency requires that the seller provide a

very high discount to the high WTP buyer. In which

case, obfuscation is more profitable because it reduces

that discount. In contrast, when the difference in WTP

is low, transparency is more profitable because it

requires only a small discount to the high WTP buyer.

We now turn attention to off-equilibrium beliefs.

Suppose that the WTP draws imply a transparency

equilibrium strategy (wl > A(wh)), but the seller chooses obfuscation instead. It is sufficient to assume that

the buyers will still believe that the seller is acting

optimally and update their posterior believing that

wl < A(wh). This simply ensures that there is no signaling value for the seller from acting suboptimally.9

Also, suppose a buyer receives a price that is different

from the equilibrium price for his WTP; it is sufficient

to assume that the buyer will still believe that the

seller is offering the optimal equilibrium price to the

other buyer. In sum, buyers believing that unob-

served seller decisions are optimal is sufficient to rule

out any off-equilibrium deviations by the seller.

Finally, we consider the case when obfuscation

completely eliminates PIF concerns but inflates DF

concerns through attention shifting (Reutskaja et al.

2011, Orquin and Loose 2013). The parameter  > 1 in

the utility function below captures the degree to which

obfuscation inflates DF concerns versus transparency:

(12)

Proposition 3. If obfuscation completely eliminates buyers' PIF concerns ( 0) and inflates DF concerns ( > 1), then the seller will choose obfuscation (transparency) in

equilibrium if wl is sufficiently far from (close to) wh, as formally given by

Proposition 3 suggests that if there is a trade-off between the PIF and DF concerns, the same result arises: if the difference in WTP is low (high), the seller will choose transparency (obfuscation). The intuition is the same as in Propositions 1 and 2. When the difference in WTP is high, transparency requires that the seller provide a very high discount to the high WTP buyer. In this case, obfuscation is more profitable because it reduces that discount. In contrast, when the difference in WTP is low, transparency is more profitable because it requires only a small discount to the high WTP buyer.

4. Experiment Design and Procedure
The three games described in the theoretical section were implemented in a two-sided, incentive-compatible laboratory experiment with three treatments. Each subject was randomly assigned to play the role of either a buyer or a seller throughout the entire experiment. In each round, a single seller was randomly and anonymously matched with two different buyers using networked computers.10 The random matching allowed different buyer­seller combinations to occur every period. Furthermore, anonymity was imposed so participants were not aware who they were matched with in any period. This anonymous matching was used to eliminate collusion, reciprocity, reputation effects, and other dynamic strategic behavior (Amaldoss and Rapoport 2005, Lim and Ho 2007, Yuan et al. 2013, Ho et al. 2014). Each period, therefore, represented a oneshot game with the decisions made in a single period independent from all the others.
The experiment included two exogenous treatments where price transparency/obfuscation was endogenously imposed, and one endogenous treatment that let sellers endogenously decide whether to obfuscate prices. Figure 3 summarizes the three treatments. Under the exogenous transparency treatment, each buyer always observed his and his peer's prices. Under the exogenous obfuscation treatment, a buyer observed only his own price. Finally, in the endogenous obfuscation treatment, the seller had an opportunity to pay a fee, , to obfuscate prices after observing both buyers' WTP. If she chose to obfuscate

prices, then each buyer would see only his own price. If she chose not to obfuscate, then full price transparency set in. Depending on their experimental conditions, buyers were fully aware whether obfuscation/ transparency was endogenously imposed or endogenously chosen by the seller. Together, the treatments were designed to elicit information on sellers' surplus allocation and to provide observations of buying behavior under different price obfuscation scenarios. This allowed us to disentangle buyer's DF and PIF concerns as well as observe whether buyers' reactions differed based on their treatment conditions.
We recruited 138 subjects ( 46 for each treatment) from a large eastern university in the United States. The majority of the subjects were students in the undergraduate business school of that university. Each of the three treatments were conducted in two sessions with, on average, 23 periods per session for a total of 2,118 observed transactions. After the instructions were given, we conducted two practice rounds in order to give participants the opportunity to learn how the experiment worked. All participants were then asked privately (i.e., on their computer screens) whether they understood the nature of the decisions they were being asked to make and were encouraged to ask questions. Once the experiment began, subjects traded for as many periods as possible over a 60-minute time frame. In order to avoid endgame behaviors (Zwick and Chen 1999, Yuan et al. 2013), subjects were informed that the experiment would last for approximately 60 minutes, but did not know which period was the last until it was over. This approach is preferable to a known fixed number of periods because it allows for the maximum number of rounds possible within the 60-minute time frame and does not require that the last period be discarded.

In each treatment, as illustrated in Figure 3, in each period, a seller set two separate prices based on two different, random WTP draws from a uniform distribution on [EC50, EC150], where EC denotes experimental dollars. Both sellers and buyers knew that seller's marginal cost was always c EC50. If the offer was rejected, both the buyer and the seller earned nothing. If the offer was accepted, the buyer obtained the difference between his WTP and the price (consumer surplus), whereas the seller kept an amount equal to the price minus the marginal cost of EC50 (producer surplus). Once all buyers made their decisions, a surplus/profit screen showed the amount each subject earned in a given round and the accumulated earnings in the game up to a given round. In order to motivate the participants to make thoughtful, realistic decisions during the experiment, an incentive-compatible design was used. Prior to starting the experiment, we explained that subjects could earn an additional $0­$10 in compensation based on their total profit/surplus at the end of the experiment.11
5. Descriptive Statistics and Model-Free Evidence
Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics from the experiment across the three treatments. In this section, we discuss how these summary observations along with the model-free data patterns are consistent with our theoretical model predictions.
We summarize these results with the following list: 1. Recall from Section 3.3 that under transparency, the low WTP buyer does not get a discount, regardless of his WTP, because he knows for sure that he is receiving a lower price. Under obfuscation, however,

he gets a discount because there is a positive probability that he is receiving a higher price. Thus, our theoretical model predicts that the average price offered to the low WTP buyer under the exogenous obfuscation treatment will be lower than that under the exogenous transparency treatment. This prediction is supported by the experiment data: pol bf 70.41 < ptlrp 74.64 (p 0.000, t. 3.450).
2. Next, recall that under transparency, the discount the high WTP buyer receives decreases in wl because the high WTP buyer observes the low WTP buyer's price. Under obfuscation, however, the discount is based only on the high WTP buyer's conditional expectation of the other buyer's price. Thus, our theoretical model predicts that the average price offered to the high WTP buyer under the exogenous obfuscation treatment will be higher than that in the exogenous transparency treatment. This prediction is supported by the experiment data: pohbf 92.29 > pthrp 89.53 (p 0.029, t. 2.188).
3. Proposition 2 states that for a given wh, the seller should endogenously choose obfuscation (transparency) if wl is sufficiently low (high). Thus, in the endogenous obfuscation treatment, we should observe the same patterns described in the first two points above. This prediction is supported by the experiment data for the endogenous case: pohbf 101.61 > pthrp 88.24 (p 0.000, t. 6.331) and pol bf 70.04 < ptlrp 75.55 (p 0.019, t. 2.353).

4. Proposition 1 predicts that seller's profit in the exogenous transparency game is decreasing in wh - wl and that it is independent of wh - wl in the exogenous obfuscation case. This prediction is illustrated graphically in Figure 4(a), where we plot the predicted profit
(expressed as a percentage of the total possible surplus) as a function of wh - wl in both treatments with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals marked in light grey. As predicted, profits are decreasing in wh - wl in the exogenous transparency case (slope -0.1711, t. -2.65) and are independent of wh - wl in the exogenous obfuscation case (slope 0.0133, t. 0.65).
5. Another way to operationalize the prediction above is to regress the seller's total profit on both buyers' WTP and compare the coefficients on wl and wh across the two treatments. The theory would predict that the coefficients would be different (similar) in the
transparency (obfuscation) treatment. This prediction
is also supported by the data. Columns (1) and (2) in
Table 2 provide the regression results for the relationship between the seller's total profits and the WTP
of both buyers for the exogenous transparency and
exogenous obfuscation treatments, respectively. Column (1) shows that the estimated coefficient for wl (0.9085) is much higher than the estimated coefficient
for wh (0.5211) in the exogenous transparency treatment, and these coefficients are statistically significantly different from each other (p 0.006). Column (2),

on the other hand, shows that in the exogenous obfuscation case, the coefficients (0.6632 versus 0.6849) are very similar and not statistically significantly different from each other (p 0.685).
6. Proposition 1 also suggests that profits under
exogenous obfuscation will be higher (lower) than profits under exogenous transparency when the difference in WTP, wh - wl, is high (low). This prediction is borne out in the data and illustrated in Figure 4(a). We see that the predicted profit lines as a function of the wh - wl in two treatments intersect. We confirm that the average profit under transparency is higher than the average profit under obfuscation in regions with low wh - wl, that is, to the left of the intersection point, wh - wl 27.14 (p 0.002, t. 2.869), and the average profit under obfuscation is higher than that under

transparency in regions with high wh - wl, that is, to the right of the intersection point (p 0.0001, t. 3.918).
7. Proposition 2 predicts that the seller would
endogenously choose to obfuscate when the difference in WTP, wh - wl, is high, which our model-free evidence strongly supports. When comparing wh - wl between the situations when sellers chose to obfuscate the prices (wh - wl 42.97) and when they chose to keep prices transparent (wh - wl 21.66), it is clear that sellers chose to obfuscate when differences in WTP were higher (p 0.000, t. 8.473). Furthermore,
as the marginal effect of the logistic regression reported in column (3) of Table 2 shows, as wh - wl increases, the probability of choosing to endogenously obfuscate increases (p 0.000, t. 4.01). Specifically, in our experiment, holding everything constant,

as the difference in WTPs increases by $1, the probability of obfuscation increases by 1.2%. This predicted relationship based on our experiment data is illustrated graphically in Figure 4(b).
8. Lemma 1 predicts that under exogenous transparency, the surplus offered to the high buyer increases in the difference in WTPs, wh - wl, and the surplus offered to the low WTP buyer is independent of this difference. The model-free evidence reported in Table 3 supports this lemma. Specifically, we find that as wh - wl increases, the additional surplus offered to the low buyer is independent of this difference (column (1) in Table 3), whereas the surplus offered to the high buyer increases in wh - wl, and this relationship is highly statistically significant (p 0.001, t. 3.12; see column (3) in Table 3). Figure 4(c) illustrates this predicted relationship graphically with 95% confidence intervals based on the estimates in Table 3 for both high and low price buyers.
9. Finally, Lemma 2 predicts that under exogenous obfuscation, the surpluses of the low and high WTP buyers will not depend on the difference in their

WTP, wh - wl, but will be a function only of their own WTP. That is indeed the case confirmed in columns (2) and (4) in Table 3 as well as in Figure 4(d).12
Overall, the descriptive results above provide strong support for the theoretical model because all of the predictions are supported by the experimental data. Next, we present an empirical model that incorporates both demand- and supply-side decisions from the experiment data to estimate the key theoretical parameters.
6. Empirical Model and Results
Recall that Proposition 2 predicts that both pricing choices, transparency and obfuscation, can systematically arise in the equilibrium of the endogenous game if obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns (i.e., lowers d). Furthermore, Proposition 3 showed that the same result can arise if obfuscation shifts attention to DF concerns (i.e., raises ). We now specify a structural model that utilizes both demand- and supply-side observed decisions and allows for separate parameter estimates under obfuscation and transparency.

6.1. Demand Let s  {trp, obf } be an index variable to denote whether prices are transparent or obfuscated. In line with the theoretical model, the utility of buyer i when offered a price pi is given by

{

Uis

si CSi + si PSi + sdDIis + saAIsj + 0,T + i if accept,

0

if reject,

ma(x 0, pj)-( p[i Pr pi < pj E pj | pi < pj, Iobf

]) 0 - pi

if Iobf 0, if Iobf 1.
(13)

In the equations above, CSi denotes buyer i's objective surplus, and PSi denotes the seller's (or producer's) surplus. The binary variable Iobf takes the value 1 if obfuscation was endogenously chosen by the seller
and 0 otherwise to capture the expected additional
obfuscation costs in the endogenous treatment. The term DIis (AIsi ) indicates the degree of disadvantageous (advantageous) inequity. The terms DIis and AIsi will differ depending on whether the pricing environment
is transparent (s trp) or obfuscated (s obf ). In the case of price transparency, DIitrp (AItirp) is the difference between the prices offered by the seller to the two buyers if buyer i's price is higher (lower) than buyer j's
price. In the case of price obfuscation, buyers do not observe each other's price, but can form an expectation of the other buyer's price; thus, DIiobf and AIoi bf measure the difference between a buyer's own price and the conditional expected price of the other buyer.13 We also include treatment fixed effects, 0,T, to control for the pricing environment. Finally, i is an i.i.d. error term that reflects unobserved differences in expec-
tations and preferences among buyers, and it is as-
sumed to have a standard logistic distribution with a
scale parameter equal to 1. With this distributional
assumption, the probability of buyer i accepting the seller's offer, Pr(Uis > 0), takes on the familiar logit probability expression.
The parameters we estimate capture subjects' utility from their own objective surplus (s) within the ex-
periment and their response to concerns regarding distributional fairness (s) and peer-induced fairness (sd and sa). By estimating separate parameters for the high and low WTP buyers, we test Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) hypothesis that concern for peer-
induced fairness differs. Consistent with our theoretical

model, we allow these parameters to vary by the pricing

environment (s  {trp, obf }). Notably, the model-free

analysis showed that, consistent with Propositions 2

and 3, sellers are significantly more likely to endog-

enously choose obfuscation over transparency as the

difference in WTP increases. However, the theoreti-

cal results also show that such an equilibrium can

arise only if obfuscation mitigates PIF concerns. The

empirical model can provide further support to our

theoretical insights if odbf and trp < obf .14

Finally, note that the utility function (Equation (13))

used for empirical estimation has a positive sign in

front of all the parameters. Thus, negative values for

sd and s are consistent with the theoretical analysis.

6.2. Supply Next, we describe the seller's optimal pricing and obfuscation decisions based on the buyer's demand model given in Equation (13). Sellers choose prices conditional on the two buyers' observed WTPs and, in the endogenous obfuscation treatment, whether to obfuscate. Within our empirical framework, the analyst observes the prices offered to both buyers, their WTPs, and both the acceptance and (if applicable) obfuscation decisions. The seller chooses the price to charge each buyer such that profit is maximized, or

where c is the marginal cost to the seller, which is set to EC50 in the experiment and is public knowledge to all participants, and  is the observed cost of obfuscation,
which varies from EC5 to EC15 with an equal prob-
ability (and this range is also known by the buyers)
under endogenous choice of price obfuscation, that is,
Iobf 1 (see the Online Appendix B for more details about the experiment).
For estimation purposes, there are two options for computing the optimal prices, psi and psj, that solve the optimization problem in Equations (14): numerically solve the first-order conditions (FOCs)
or employ a grid search for the prices that yield maximum profits. We utilized the second approach because it was computationally faster.15 Thus, for
transactions within the exogenous transparency (ob-
fuscation) treatments, we compute the pair of optimal prices ptirp and ptjrp (poi bf  and poj bf ) that result in

138

maximized profits of trp (obf ) as per Equation (14a)

(Equation (14b)).

In the endogenous obfuscation treatment, the seller

strategically chooses transparency over obfuscation if

it yields higher profits, and vice versa. Thus, we compute

both and

pairs the

of optimal prices, corresponding

(ptirp, ptjrp) and (poi bf , maximized profits,

and obf . We model the probability that the seller

endogenously chooses price obfuscation as

(15)

The difference between the expected profits, , is assumed to be logistically distributed so the probability of obfuscation takes on a familiar logit form.16
Equations (13), (14), and (15) highlight the logic behind the structural model. On the demand side, we observe buyers' acceptance/rejection decisions. Equation (13) captures their utility from acceptance based on their beliefs and expectations about the prices offered to their peers. On the supply side, we observe sellers' prices in all treatments and their obfuscation decisions in the endogenous obfuscation treatment. The former is captured by Equations (14), and the latter is captured by Equation (15). Naturally, buyers' utility in Equation (13) enters into Equations (14) and (15).

6.3. Empirical Model Estimation and Results
We begin by investigating two simpler empirical specifications that focus solely on demand, and conclude with a discussion involving the complete model that includes demand, prices, and the probability of obfuscation. In column (1) of Table 4, we present the results

Allender et al: Price Fairness and Strategic Obfuscation Marketing Science, 2021, vol. 40, no. 1, pp. 122­146, © 2020 The Author(s)
from estimating the logit demand probability alone, whereby the likelihood of accepting the price is a function of consumer surplus, distributional fairness, and both advantageous (low WTP) and disadvantageous (high WTP) peer-induced fairness concerns as defined in Equation (13).
The main problem with the specification in column (1) is that price shows up in all the right-handside terms (CSi, PSi, DIis, and AIsi ) of the utility in Equation (13), which causes multicollinearity. Thus, in column (2), we present the results of the specification that uses proportional differences to measure inequity instead of the absolute differences as reported in column (1) and described in Equation (13).17 Here, we construct PSi to reflect the surplus that the seller keeps for herself (if the offer is accepted) as a proportion of the total surplus, and DIis and AIsi to capture peer-induced inequity as a proportion of the buyer surplus offered, that is, DIis (pi - pj)/(wi - pi) and AIsi (pj - pi)/(wi - pi).18 This utility scaling preserves all of the intuition and predictions from the theoretical model and allows us to evaluate whether the specification with absolute or proportional differences explains the experiment data better. Based on the loglikelihood of the proportional inequity specification compared with the absolute inequity specification shown in Table 4, -819.758 versus -847.740, respectively, the proportional inequity specification fits the data better and is thus our preferred inequity construct that we subsequently use in the equilibrium model.
Finally, column (3) in Table 4 presents the results from the full equilibrium model, which accounts for both buyer and seller decisions described in

Sections 6.1 and 6.2, that is, that buyers make their decisions to accept or reject the seller's offer with the knowledge that sellers have the ability and the option to obfuscate prices. Moreover, in the endogenous obfuscation case, sellers know that buyers will update their beliefs and expectations about peer price accordingly. Utilizing both buyers' and sellers' decisions also addresses any potential endogeneity issues that could arise when using buyer decisions alone.
We use maximum likelihood to estimate the models shown in Table 4. In particular, the estimation approach for the preferred specification in column (3) is to jointly (i) maximize the likelihood of observed buyers' acceptance/rejection decisions based on Equation (13), (ii) minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed prices and the predicted optimal price based on the grid search solution to Equations (14), and (iii) maximize the likelihood of sellers' transparency/obfuscation decisions in the endogenous treatment based on Equation (15). This way, sellers' pricing and obfuscation decisions are fully consistent with buyers' decisions to accept or reject the sellers' offers.
Next, we discuss the results from our preferred specification shown in column (3) of Table 4 that capture both buyer and seller decisions. Buyers' compensation for participating in the experiment was affected only by the objective surplus (wi - pi) that they accumulated throughout the experiment. Thus, not surprisingly, the total surplus the seller offered had a positive and highly statistically significant effect (trp > 0 and obf > 0) on the buyer's decision to accept the price. Moreover, the importance buyers placed on their accumulated surplus did not differ significantly across the transparent or obfuscated conditions.
Distributional fairness is likely to be important to buyers if they think the pricing mechanism is inherently unfair, regardless of the prices offered to others. The results in Table 4 suggest that in both pricing environments, distributional fairness has a statistically significant, negative effect on the likelihood of accepting an offer (trp < 0 and obf < 0). As mentioned above, buyers' actual monetary compensation at the end of the experiment depended only on the accumulated objective surplus, which would have been maximized only if all prices were accepted, regardless of whether they were perceived as fair or not. The significance of DF concerns highlights the fact that buyers have an inherent tendency to refuse offers that they perceive as unfair even if such refusal makes them economically worse off.
In terms of the peer-induced fairness concerns, the results in Table 4 imply that buyers respond differently depending on whether they are given the higher

139
or lower price, relative to their peers (|tarp| |tdrp|). When buyers are able to see what others are offered, they are especially sensitive to their position relative to their peers, and are significantly less likely to accept if they are given a higher price. However, when buyers are offered a better deal compared with their peers, their utility is not affected by the advantageous position (i.e., tarp is not statistically different from zero).
Notably, the structural model results support the insights of the theoretical model. Proposition 2 of our theory model suggests that the equilibrium where both obfuscation and transparency can coexist is possible only when |tdrp| > |odbf |.19 This is exactly what we find with the equilibrium model results reported in column (3) of Table 4: price obfuscation effectively eliminated the peer-induced fairness concerns (|tdrp| > |odbf |). This is consistent with our theoretical conjecture (outlined in Proposition 2) of obfuscation mitigating the fairness concerns (i.e., 0 <  < 1).
Furthermore, the results also suggest that although obfuscation can be highly effective at reducing PIF concerns, at the same time, it can increase distributional fairness concerns (|tdrp| < |odbf |). This is consistent with an attention shifting explanation (Reutskaja et al. 2011, Orquin and Loose 2013). In a transparent environment, the buyer directly observes seller's cost as well as the peer price. Because both are salient, he directly evaluates the distributional and the peerinduced inequity. On the other hand, in an obfuscation environment, peer price is not directly observed, which makes it less salient and shifts attention/ weight to the more salient and directly observed distributional inequity. Thus, our results suggest an interesting trade-off between the distributional and peer-induced fairness that is also predicted in Proposition 3 of our theoretical model: although obfuscation is highly effective at overcoming disadvantaged buyers' peer-induced fairness concerns, which allows the seller to charge higher prices, this pricing power is constrained by increased distributional fairness concerns.
Finally, our fixed effect estimates (specifically, positive and statistically significant fixed effects for the exogenous transparency treatment) suggest that buyers have an inherent preference for transparency after all of the behavioral and nonbehavioral drivers of decision making are controlled for.
7. Concluding Remarks
Firms are increasingly collecting and analyzing individual customer data that facilitate their ability to determine not only each buyer's WTP for goods, but also the value buyers place on the attributes of the items and potential add-on products. However, a

140

company's ability to charge different prices is constrained by perceptions that paying a higher price than someone else is inherently unfair. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically study how buyers respond to sellers strategically obfuscating price information while accounting for both peer-induced and distributional fairness concerns.
The theoretical analysis shows that price obfuscation can be a sustainable outcome in equilibrium, even if consumers know that this pricing practice is chosen strategically by the seller. We find that with price transparency, sellers are able to price discriminate the lower priced consumer more effectively and at the same time reduce the difference in prices offered to the buyers. In addition, consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that obfuscation can be profitable in equilibrium when differences in consumer WTP are sufficiently high, and when obfuscation effectively reduces PIF concerns. However, as the differential between buyers' WTP narrows, and/or obfuscation becomes increasingly costly, it may be more profitable to maintain a transparent pricing regime.
We test our theoretical predictions with a two-sided experiment whereby a price-discriminating seller is randomly and anonymously matched with two utilitymaximizing buyers. We find that price obfuscation is highly effective at mitigating consumer peer-induced fairness concerns. At the same time, our empirical results suggest that there is a trade-off between the peerinduced and distributional fairness concerns: once the prices are obfuscated, consumers shift their attention to evaluate the distributional inequity more scrupulously.
This paper derives rich insights from the theoretical model and verifies its predictions using experimental data. The main strength of this approach is its ability to rule out alternative mechanisms that might be at play and focus on the interaction between strategic price obfuscation and peer-induced fairness concerns. A laboratory environment as well as anonymous and random seller and buyer matching allows us to isolate consumer fairness concerns from other confounding effects such as reciprocity, betrayal, or altruism that are present in transactional data. This does not necessarily mean that our approach is better than another one that analyzes actual transaction data. We believe both are complimentary; our approach has higher explanatory power, and the latter approach will have higher external validity. It is important to note that although we cannot claim that our approach has the same level of external validity as using actual transaction data, our theoretical model and experimental setup capture the essential elements faced by firms who may practice price discrimination in the presence of PIF concerns. In particular, our model captures consumer uncertainty regarding the valuations/prices of others as well as how they update

their beliefs upon observing sellers' pricing and obfuscation strategies.
Our findings have a number of implications for managerial practice in a range of settings. First, in online environments, where price discrimination is likely to be both more profitable and technologically feasible, price transparency will likely become a thing of the past as sellers realize the value in keeping "firewalls" around their one-on-one deals with individual customers. Second, the practice of obfuscating price discrimination is also likely to become more prominent in the public policy conversation as buyers begin to realize that they are paying more for relatively common items compared with a fully transparent market. Nonetheless, if privacy concerns in online commerce dominate, then consumers may become less likely to want to share information on how much they paid in any particular transaction. Third, greater complexity, both in product attributes and pricing structures, will become the rule for selling when prices are potentially transparent. Easily sold as providing value through "customization" to fit specific needs, complexity and obfuscation are two sides of the same coin.
Our findings are also potentially important for price-regulation policy. In terms of the welfare effects on consumers, our model suggests that buyers will still make a purchase if they have positive surplus, but the amount of surplus earned can be lower (higher) for high (low) WTP buyers compared with when no obfuscation is allowed. How is it possible that buyers knowingly allow themselves to be prevented from seeing other prices and yet still purchase? In reality, there are many instances where consumers know that retailers charge different prices to different consumers (e.g., widespread coupon usage, personalized offers, etc.). Consumers might know that firms are keeping their price-discrimination strategies hidden and might grumble about the prices they pay, but they still willingly make purchases. This is especially true when other buyers' prices are sufficiently obfuscated. That said, if the seller is discriminating effectively, then some consumers will pay a lower price than the one the seller will charge under a uniform pricing policy. Even though the seller makes more profit, total welfare may, in fact, rise as more consumers are served, and some may pay a lower price (Varian 1985). It is now well understood that the welfare effects of first- and third-degree price discrimination are fundamentally ambiguous, so it is not possible to say absolutely that total consumer surplus decreases by a practice that enables price discrimination (for the conditions required for monopoly price discrimination to raise social welfare, see Aguirre et al. 2010). In this case, our analysis presents an interesting conundrum where seemingly sensible regulation intended to prevent price discrimination

(promote price transparency) can actually be welfare decreasing. This possibility has not gone unnoticed by regulators, as staff economists at the Federal Trade Commission have formally questioned whether price transparency in the healthcare industry is in fact a good idea (Koslov and Jex 2015, Shapiro 2018).

Lemma A.2. Let H(x, y) be a continuous function, strictly increasing (decreasing) in x (y) on [x, x] × [y, y]  R2. Furthermore, H(x, y) > 0 and H(x, y) < 0 for all x, such that a unique
function, y^ : [x, x]  [y, y], satisfies H(x, y^(x)) 0 and H(x, y) >
0  y < y^(x) for all x. Then, y^( · ) must be strictly increasing.

Proof. Consider any two arbitrary values, x1, x2 : x  x1 < x2  x. By definition, H(x1, y^(x1)) H(x2, y^(x2)) 0. Because H is increasing in x, we must have H(x2, y^(x1)) > H(x1, y^(x1)) 0. Because H is decreasing in y, H(x2, y^(x2)) 0, and H(x2, y^(x1)) > 0, y^(x2) > y^(x1) for all x1, x2 : x  x1 < x2  x.

Proof. Let H(x) represent the line connecting the two points (x, G(x)) and ((x, G(x)). Because H is linear, G(x) H(x), and G(x) > H(x), H(x) > H(x), x  [x, x). Because G is concave,

we must have G(x) > H(x),for all x  [x,x), which implies that G(x) > H(x) > H(x), for all x  [x, x).

Thus, the utility function is strictly decreasing in price.

The seller's optimization problem is maxpa, pb pa + pb, subject to Ui(wi, pi; i)  0, for all, j  {a, b}, i j. The maximand is in-

creasing in price; thus, the constraint must be binding at

the solution, Ui(wi, p(wi))

and the optimal price, p(wi), must satisfy 0. From Lemma A.2, the optimal price must

be increasing in the WTP. 

Appendix B. Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1. The seller objective function (constraints) in Equation (3) is (are) strictly increasing (decreasing) in prices; hence, both constraints must be binding at the

Proof of Lemma 3. Let the arbitrary posterior CDF, ^ (wj)

Pr(Wj < wj | Iobf 1), denote buyer i's posterior beliefs on Wj

conditional on observing obfuscation. The seller's optimal

Thus,

(B.6)

Taken together, the inequalities in (B.4), (B.5), and (B.6)
imply that for any arbitrary set of consumer beliefs, there must exist a unique increasing function, A( · ), satisfying (wh, A(wh)) 0, and the resulting optimal obfuscation policy given in (10) follows directly. 

Proof of Lemma 4. Buyer i's prior on Wj is F(wj) Pr(Wj < wj) wwj--ww. Upon observing obfuscation, buyer i updates

his beliefs using Bayes' rule: Pr(Wj < wj|Iobf 1)

. P r(Wj<wj) P r(Io b f 1|Wj<wj.)

Because

both

and

un-

conditional obfuscation probabilities, Pr(Iobf 1 | Wj < wj) and

Pr(Iobf 1), also depend on wi, we derive two separate cases.

Case 1 (wi < A(w)). Obfuscation occurs when either Wj <

A(wi) or wi < A(Wj)  Wj > A-1(wi). Therefore, Pr(Iobf 1)

(B.8)

The posterior CDF in (11) is a succinct representation
of (B.7) and (B.8). The remainder of the lemma follows directly. 

Proof of Proposition 2. First, we prove part iv. Suppose buyers expect a pricing strategy of p^(w) under obfuscation, such that p^(·) is increasing; hence, Pr(p^(Wj)  pi) Pr(Wj  p^-1(pi)). Buyer i's utility under obfuscation from the lower prong of Equation (8) becomes

The seller's equilibrium pricing strategy must satisfy the optimality condition: pend(wi) arg maxpi pi, subject to Uiend (wi, pi; p^( · ))  0. The constraint Uiend  0 is binding at the solution. Note that Uiend is strictly decreasing (increasing) in

price (WTP). In addition, it is strictly positive (negative) at

Next, we prove that if  1, the obfuscation region col-

Set  1, and suppose that the equilibrium obfuscation decision follows Equation (10) such that A(w) > w and the shaded regions in Figure 3(a) are nonempty. Suppose that wh > A(w)  (wh) 1 and wl A(wh). By definition of A(·), the seller must be indifferent between obfuscation and transparency such that

tend(wh) + tend(A(wh)) ttrp(wh, A(wh)).

(B.13)

Note that pend(·) pmax(·) - tend(·). Because tend(·) is increasing, pmax(·) must be increasing faster than pend(·), which

is sufficient to ensure that the inequality above is true.

Inequality (B.10) (inequality (B.12)) establishes that (wh, wl)
is negative (positive) at wl wh (wl w), and inequality (B.13) establishes that (wh, wl) is decreasing in wl. Therefore, for every wh, there must exist a unique A(wh) such that (wh, wl) > 0  wl < A(wh). Furthermore, as  goes up (down), (wh, wl) and A(wh) go down (up), and the obfuscation regions in Figure 3(a) shrink (expand). At the extreme, A(·)  w if

  1, and the obfuscation region becomes empty. This

concludes the proof of part i. The remainder of the results

directly follow.

Finally, for part vi, Lemma 3 established that the condition





+ ++d

is

sufficient

to

ensure

that

the

sellers

follow

the

obfuscation strategy in (10) regardless of buyers' beliefs. In

turn, there cannot not exist any alternative set of beliefs and

optimal strategies that satisfy the sequential rationality and Bayesian consistency requirements. 

Proof of Proposition 3. The equilibrium transparency prices
and profits are identical to those in Lemma 1. Because ob-
fuscation eliminates PIF concerns, optimal obfuscation prices simply set the utility to zero, such that pend(wi) +wi. The optimal obfuscation decision directly follows from comparing profits. 

Endnotes
1 For ease of exposition, throughout this paper, we refer to a male buyer (using pronouns he, his, and him) and a female seller (using pronouns she, hers, and her).
2 We can add a positive PIF term, a Pr(pi < Pj | i)(E[Pj | pi < Pj; i] - pi), which captures the positive utility a buyer gets from getting a lower price than the other buyer, weighted by a parameter a  0. Adding such a term, however, sacrifices a great deal of parsimony without providing additional insights. In the empirical model, we allow for a positive PIF term. For expositional clarity, and without loss of generality, we assume that a 0 in the theoretical analysis. All of the predictions of the model are maintained as long as a < d, which is a reasonable assumption given prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979, 1992).
3 See Lemma A.4 in Appendix A, which shows that the seller's optimal price is increasing in WTP regardless of buyers' expectations and beliefs.

4 The constraint Uiobf  0 is binding at the solution. Note that Uiobf is strictly decreasing (increasing) in price (WTP). In addition, it is strictly positive (negative) at pi 0 (at pi pmax(wi)). Thus, for any wi  [w, w], there must exist a unique pobf (wi) such that pobf(wi) is strictly increasing and satisfies Uiobf (wi, pobf (wi); pobf ( · )) 0. Moreover, in equilibrium, Pr(Wj  p^-1(pi)) must reduce to F(wi)  Pr(Wj  wi). 5 We omitted this effect in the previous exogenous analyses to simplify the exposition and make the intuition as clear as possible. Adding any   (0, 1) will simply expand the region in which exogenous obfuscation is more profitable. All the previous results and intuition remain qualitatively and directionally the same.
6 Recall that we used the superscript obf to denote exogenous obfuscation variables. Because endogenous obfuscation yields different equilibrium outcomes, we use the superscript eobf . In contrast, endogenous and exogenous transparency yield the same equilibrium outcomes, and we use the same superscript, trp, for both.
7 Without imposing any conditions on , we can show that if buyers believe that the seller's obfuscation strategy follows Equation (10), it will be optimal for the seller to actually use that strategy (sequential rationality requirement), and that such a belief satisfies the Bayesian consistency requirement. Thus, the equilibrium will hold for any , but it will not be possible to analytically prove uniqueness. It is also worth noting that although this condition is sufficient but not necessary to analytically prove uniqueness, numerical solutions across the entire parameter space suggest that the equilibrium is indeed unique for any   (0, 1).
8 Recall that Proposition 1 showed that when the obfuscation/ transparency decision was not strategic (exogenous), obfuscation yielded more profits to the seller when the difference in buyers' WTP was sufficiently high.
9 The reverse case is trivial. Suppose that the WTP draws imply an obfuscation equilibrium strategy, but the seller chooses transparency instead. In this case, buyers do not have to form any new beliefs, as they will simply observe each other's price, rendering that deviation suboptimal for the seller.
10 Participant interaction was facilitated using the z-Tree software, which is the Zurich Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments (Fischbacher 2007).
11 Subjects were paid $20 for their participation in the experiment, which was the minimum we could pay based on the experimental laboratory's guidelines. The additional payment of $0­$10 was based on total surplus earned in experimental credits, which was converted to the real U.S. currency. See Online Appendix B for more details.
12 In Figure 4, (c) and (d), we graph residualized consumer surplus after controlling for own WTP.
13 When prices are obfuscated, we operationalize Pr(pj < pi) (Pr(pi < pj)) by dividing the number of times an obfuscated price was set below (above) pi within the same treatment by the total number of times an obfuscated price was set within treatment. We also operationalize E[pj | pj < pi, s obf ] (E[pj | pi < pj, s obf ]) by averaging all obfuscated prices set below (above) pi within treatment. 14 Stating that tdrp > odbf is equivalent to  < 1 in the theoretical model, and trp < obf is equivalent to  > 1.
15 The FOCs included fractions where both the denominator and numerator were very small numbers (approached zero) and required computing limits. Given the finite space of possible prices (between $50 and $150), it was computationally much faster to utilize a grid search approach.
16 The extreme value theorem states that the limiting distribution of the max{obf , trp} will belong to one of the generalized extreme value probability distributions as long as the underlying distribution of obf and trp is the same for both, regardless of the distribution itself.

145

Similar to the idea that a consumer will choose the option that yields

the most intrinsic value, we assume that the distribution of the seller's

transparency or obfuscation choice will also follow a type 1 extreme

value distribution.

17 Relative income has been shown to be a more significant driver for

subjective happiness levels than absolute income (for a good review,

see, e.g., Clark et al. 2008). In our case, for example, a $10 difference in

prices offered to two buyers is likely to be judged differently when the

offered consumer surplus is $20 (a 50% difference) versus when

offered consumer surplus is $50 (a 20% difference).

18 As such, proportional DIis (AIsi ) captures the boost (reduction) in

consumer i's surplus if he received pj (or E[pj | ·]) instead of pi. For

instance, DIitrp for AIsi .

19 Note that in our theory model, we posit that d > 0 and  > 0, but

they enter the theoretical utility function with negative signs. In the

empirical portion of this paper, we do not restrict these parameters to

be positive or negative; thus, we report the estimated coefficients with

their respective signs; that is, a negative estimated d is equivalent to the positive d in the theory model

20 Under exogenous obfuscation (Section 3.2), ^ (Wj) converges to the uniform prior. Under endogenous obfuscation (Section 3.4), ^ (Wj) is updated according to Bayes' rule depending on the buyer's beliefs

about the seller's obfuscation strategy.
