The Dynamic Advertising Effect of Collegiate Athletics
Doug J. Chung

Imeasure the spillover effect of intercollegiate athletics on the quantity and quality of applicants to institutions of higher education in the United States--an effect popularly known as the "Flutie effect." I treat athletic success as a stock of goodwill that decays over time, similar to that of advertising. A major challenge is that privacy laws prevent us from observing information about the applicant pool. I overcome this challenge by using order statistic distribution to infer applicant quality from information on enrolled students. Using a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model that accommodates heterogeneity in preferences for school quality and athletic success, as well as an extensive set of school fixed effects to control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I estimate the impact of athletic success on applicant quality and quantity. Overall, athletic success has a significant, long-term goodwill effect on future applications and quality. However, students with lower-than-average SAT scores tend to have a stronger preference for athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater preference for academic quality. Furthermore, the decay rate of athletics' goodwill is significant only for students with lower SAT scores, suggesting that the goodwill created by intercollegiate athletics resides more extensively with lower-scoring students than with their higher-scoring counterparts. But, surprisingly, athletic success impacts applications even among academically stronger students.

1. Introduction
On a stormy day in November 1984, Boston College and the University of Miami played an extraordinary football game, an electrifying shootout with 1,273 yards of total offense and multiple lead changes throughout. However, it was the final play of the game that has persisted for decades in the minds of sports fans nationwide: The score was Miami, 45; Boston College, 41. With six seconds remaining, Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie made a miraculous Hail Mary touchdown pass to win the game.1 Nationally televised the day after Thanksgiving, the game had a huge viewing audience. The win qualified Boston College--which finished the season with a 10­2 record and a top-five ranking in the 1984 Final AP (Associated Press) Poll--to compete in the Cotton Bowl, one of the New Year's bowl games.2 Flutie won the Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious individual award in college football, and
1 A Hail Mary pass is a term used to describe a long forward pass that has a very small probability of success. It usually is called into play toward the end of a game in which it is the only option for winning.
2 At the time, the schools with the most successful regular seasons were invited to one of five New Year's bowl games: the Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Rose, and Sugar bowls. The rankings of schools in college football are determined by multiple polls including the AP Poll, Coaches Poll, and Harris Poll. Of these, the AP Poll, which is compiled by sportswriters throughout the United States and is

subsequently enjoyed a successful career as a professional football player and TV analyst.
Two years after this extraordinary game, Boston College experienced an approximately 30% surge in applications. Ever since, the popular media have called this phenomenon the "Flutie effect," referring to an increase in exposure and prominence of an academic institution as a result of the success of its athletics program. As USA Today described it, "Whether it's called the `Flutie factor' or `mission-driven intercollegiate athletics,' the effect of having a winning sports team is showing up at admissions offices nationwide" (Dodd 1997, p. 1A).
Boston College has not been alone in witnessing a surge of applications stemming from success on the playing field. Applications to Georgetown University rose 45% between 1983 and 1986, a period during which its men's basketball appeared three times in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship finals. Similarly, Northwestern University experienced a 21% increase in applications in 1996, a year after winning the Big Ten Championship in football.
More recently, an 18% increase in applications followed Boise State University's successful 2006­2007 football season, which included a win over college

football powerhouse University of Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl to cap a perfect 13­0 season. Texas Christian University (TCU), after decades of mediocrity in college football, was able to land in the AP Top 25 rankings for the first time in over 40 years in 2000. Ever since, TCU has frequently been in the top of the college football rankings, enjoying media exposure with many nationally televised games. Its admissions office also enjoyed a whopping 105% increase in applications from 2000 to 2008.
However, is the so-called Flutie effect for real? Boston College's then Director of Admissions John Maguire does not seem to think so: "Doug Flutie cemented things, but the J. Donald Monan factor and the Frank Campanella factor are the real story," he said, referring to Boston College's former president and executive vice president (McDonald 2003). Maguire believes that Boston College experienced a surge in applications in the mid-1980s because of its investments in residence halls, academic facilities, and financial aid. So he claims that the Flutie effect was minimal, at best, and did not contribute as much as the popular press claimed it had (McDonald 2003).
The primary form of mass media advertising by academic institutions in the United States is, arguably, through its athletics program. Therefore, this study investigates the possible advertising effects of intercollegiate athletics. Specifically, it looks at the spillover effect, if any, and the magnitude and divergence that athletic success has on the quantity and quality of applications received by an academic institution of higher education in the United States. Furthermore, I look at how students of different abilities place heterogeneous values on athletic success versus academic quality.
For many people residing in the United States, intercollegiate athletics is a big part of their everyday lives. During the college football season, it is common to see live college football games being broadcast in primetime slots by not only sports-affiliated cable channel networks (e.g., ESPN) but also major over-the-air networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS).3 Yet it is surprising to see very limited research in this area.
McCormick and Tinsley (1987) are the first to examine the possible link between athletics and academics. They find that, on average, schools in major athletic conferences tend to attract higher-quality students4 than those in nonmajor conferences and that the trend
3 ABC's Saturday Night Football, which broadcasts major college football games live, runs from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. on Saturday evenings during the college football season. More information about the popularity of college football is given in the following sections.
4 My definition of student quality and student ability pertains to standardized test scores; thus, high-quality (or high-ability) students are those students that score well on standardized tests and

in the percentage of conference wins in football is positively correlated with the increase in the quality of incoming students. They hypothesize that intercollegiate athletics has an advertising effect and, as a result, suggest that schools with athletic success may receive a greater number of applications, thus allowing them to be more selective in admissions. Similar to McCormick and Tinsley (1987), Tucker and Amato (1993), using a different time frame for the data, find that football success increases the quality of incoming students. Using only a single year of school information, however, these studies rely primarily on cross-sectional identification to determine the impact of historical athletic success on the quality of the incoming freshman class, essentially ignoring any unobserved school-specific effects that might be correlated with athletic success.
In comparison, Murphy and Trandel (1994) and Pope and Pope (2009), using panel data, focus more on short-term episodic athletic success and its impact on academics. Although these studies, in aggregate, are able to control for unobserved school-specific effects, by relying solely on a descriptive model, they are unable to precisely capture shifts in preferences by potential students. In addition, aside from Pope and Pope (2009), all of the foregoing studies ignore any heterogeneous effects of athletics on students of different ability. Furthermore, these studies use institutional-level data, disregarding any specific market-level characteristics that would likely affect demand for higher education in different markets. That is, both Murphy and Trandel (1994) and Pope and Pope (2009) use the aggregate number of applications per institution per year as their observation points, whereas I use market-level (state-level) data to infer school preferences for students who reside in different markets. Moreover, by examining only changes in the aggregate, these studies do not account for any heterogeneity in preferences for athletic success that is likely to exist among high school seniors applying to colleges and universities in the United States. Most importantly, none of the above studies accounts for the relative value of athletic success compared to other factors (monetary/psychological costs, academic quality, etc.) that determine an applicant's choice of demand for higher education.
I distinguish from these studies and treat athletic success as a stock of goodwill that decays over time, similar to that of advertising. Relying on the utilitymaximizing behavior of high school seniors applying to colleges and universities in the United States, I build and estimate a structural model of demand for higher
low-quality (or low-ability) students are those who do not score well on such tests. I use the terms for student quality and ability interchangeably throughout.

education to determine the effect and magnitude that these goodwill stocks can have on the outcome of school admissions. My goal is twofold: (1) to determine if there is, indeed, an advertising spillover effect from athletic success; and, if so, (2) to identify the magnitude of the effect on the quality and quantity of applications and impact on school selectivity rates. Furthermore, using market-level data, I examine the relative importance of athletic success compared to other factors (academic quality, tuition costs, distance from home, etc.) that influence students of different abilities.
From a modeling perspective, using an extensive set of school fixed effects to control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I apply a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model to allow for heterogeneity in preferences where athletic success shifts school preferences for high school seniors applying to colleges and universities. A major challenge is that privacy laws prevent us from observing information about the applicant pool. I overcome this challenge by developing an order statistics-based approach to infer applicant quality from information on enrolled students.
Overall, I find that athletic success has a significant impact on the quantity and quality of applicants that a school receives. However, I find that students with lower-than-average SAT scores have a stronger preference for athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater preference for academic quality. Furthermore, I find that the carryover rate of goodwill stocks for athletic success is evident only for students with lower SAT scores, suggesting that students of low ability intertemporally value the success of intercollegiate athletics more and discount it less than their high-ability counterparts. In addition, I find that when a school goes from being mediocre to performing well on the football field, applications increase by 17.7%, with the vast proportion of the increase coming from low-ability students. However, there is also an increase in applications from students at the highest ability level. To attain similar effects, a school must either decrease tuition by 3.8% or increase the quality of education by recruiting higherquality faculty who are paid 5.1% more in the academic labor market. I also find that schools become more selective with athletic success. For the mid-level school, in terms of average SAT scores, the admissions rate would decline by 4.8% with high-level athletic success.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of collegiate athletics and the data used for empirical analysis. Sections 3 and 4 present the model and estimation methodology, respectively. Section 5 discusses the results and counterfactual analysis. Section 6 concludes.

2. Collegiate Athletics and Data
2.1. Collegiate Athletics The first college football game was played between Rutgers University and Princeton University in 1869. The last years in which a nonathletic scholarshipgranting school claimed a major title in college football were 1944­1946 and 1950, when the United States Military Academy and Princeton University, respectively, won the College Football National Championship. In those days, collegiate athletics served mainly to increase diversity and boost pride and selfawareness among the student body and alumni.
Things have changed significantly over the past several decades. Although one of its missions continues to be to increase diversity and morale, collegiate athletics today is a multibillion-dollar industry that rakes in huge amounts of revenue for the participating institutions. It acts as a huge catalyst in boosting the regional economy, and at public institutions, it is not uncommon to see the head coaches as one of the highest-paid state employees. In terms of mere numbers, college football topped $2 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in profit in 2010, and the single highest revenue-generating institution, the University of Texas at Austin, generated $94 million of revenue in football alone (Isidore 2010). Nick Saban, the head football coach at the University of Alabama, is the highestpaid coach, with an annual income of close to $6 million (USA Today 2010). The total fan base for college football, 103 million people, represents approximately one-third of the U.S. population, and 43% of U.S. residents viewed at least one of the 35 postseason bowl games in the 2010­2011 (hereafter referred to as the 2010) football season (Rovell 2011). The University of Nebraska holds the longest home game sellout streak, dating back to 1962 (311 as of the end of the 2010 football season; see Nebraska Athletics Official Web Site 2013), and the average home game ticket price in the secondary market in 2009 for Ohio State was $524, the highest among all schools (Rishe 2010). Though not the original goal when it was institutionalized, intercollegiate athletics has become both commercialized and a significant part of regional economies.
To investigate the effect of a successful athletics program on admissions, I utilize multiple data sets, each compiled to match one of the 120 institutions that participate in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Collegiate athletics, like professional sports, is organized as a hierarchy of divisions, with Division I being the highest level of competition. Based on football affiliation, within Division I are the Division I FBS and Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).5 Division I FBS is the
5 These two subdivisions were formerly known as Division I-A and Division I-AA. The key organizational difference is that the former

strongest of all divisions and is considered the main division. Therefore, my analysis focuses only on the set of institutions that participates in this division.6 Figure 1 outlines the subdivisions and conferences within Division I.
Presently, Division 1 FBS is further subdivided into the AQ (automatic qualifying) and non-AQ (also known as mid-majors) conferences.7 The main difference between them is that the conference champions

relies on bowl games after the regular season to determine the champion and the latter determines the champion through a playoff system. The substantive difference is that the former utilizes many more resources than the latter and can award up to 85 athletic scholarships, compared with the former's 63. Furthermore, Division I FBS teams have better facilities and a bigger alumni base, which results in larger amounts of contributions to support their athletic programs. There are several conferences within Division I that do not sponsor football. These conferences are referred to as a part of Division I non-football, or unofficially, as Division I-AAA.
6 Although most schools in Division I FBS jointly operate football and basketball programs, some schools with basketball programs considered high profile are not part of this division (e.g., Georgetown and Gonzaga).
7 As of December 2010, the AQ conferences (also referred to as the Bowl Championship Series, or BCS, conferences) included the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big East Conference, Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Pacific (Pac)-10 Conference, and Southeastern Conference (SEC); the non-AQ conferences included

of the AQ conferences are automatically invited to a BCS bowl game at the end of the regular season, whereas invitations to such bowl games are more difficult to obtain for non-AQ conference teams. Although the definition of success varies with school and preseason expectations, a season is generally deemed successful if a team goes to a BCS bowl game.8 Hence, AQ conference schools tend to have superior facilities and funding and, as a result, attract more talented studentathletes to their athletic programs.
2.2. Data The primary data for admissions were collected through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The core of the postsecondary education data collection program for the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), IPEDS contains data on the number of applications received, number of applicants admitted, and number and distribution of SAT scores for students enrolled at each institution of higher education. To ascertain the origin of applications, I manually collected data from the annual state-level report "College-Bound Seniors," compiled by the College Board (the implementer of the SAT). This data set contains the exact number of SAT score reports sent by high school seniors in each state seeking admission to colleges and universities throughout the United States. It also contains the distribution of overall SAT scores by state.
Institutional characteristics such as average faculty salary, whether the school is a public or private institution, the size of the student body, the total number of faculty, and published in-state and out-of-state tuition costs were also collected through IPEDS. The historical number of high school graduates by state for each year over the sample period was collected through the NCES. The college-going rate by state per year, which represents the proportion of high school students in each state that goes to college, was obtained from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) Information Center. To control for inflation, the history of the consumer price index, obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was used to convert any monetary variables in the analysis to 2009 U.S. dollars. The distance from a specific state to an institution was manually obtained using publicly available software.9
the Conference USA (C-USA), Mid-American Conference (MAC), Mountain West Conference (MWC), Sun Belt Conference, and Western Athletic Conference (WAC).
8 As of the 2010 season, the BCS bowl games are the Fiesta, Orange, Rose, and Sugar bowls, and the BCS National Championship Game.
9 The Web tool DistanceFromTo (http://distancefromto.net) was used to calculate distances from students' home states to each institution.

Notes. Data shown are for 120 schools participating in Division I FBS during the years 2001­2009. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses.

Athletic performance data were hand-collected from multiple data sources including Wikipedia, STASSEN.COM College Football Information, and Sports-Reference.com. As a measure of athletic performance, I used the total number of wins per season for the school's football program. Although slightly different by conference and season, Division I FBS teams typically play 12 games in a regular season.10 In bigger conferences with subconferences, a conference championship game is held between the subconference champions.11 After the regular season, teams with six or more wins qualify for a postseason bowl game; for each bowl game, a bowl committee selects the teams that will participate. As previously noted, the conference champions of AQ conferences automatically qualify for a BCS bowl game, and the two top-ranking teams in the BCS standings play for the BCS National Championship. Thus, the maximum number of games a team can win is 14 (12 regularseason games plus 1 conference championship and 1 bowl game). I hypothesize that with each additional win, a team would receive greater media exposure via TV, newspapers, and other media outlets, which would translate into an advertising effect for the school. I therefore use the total number of games won in a season to measure the success of a particular school's athletic performance.
10 Teams that play at Hawaii have the option of scheduling a 13th regular-season game to offset travel costs. This rule, referred to as the "Hawaii exemption," also gives the University of Hawaii the option of playing a 13th game.
11 As of the 2010 season, the ACC, Big-12, C-USA, MAC, and SEC have a conference championship game in Division I FBS.

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the data. The AQ conference schools tend to receive more applications and have larger student bodies. The difference is clearer for private schools: those in AQ conferences receive twice as many applications as their non-AQ counterparts, despite similar enrollments. Private schools are generally more selective in both subdivisions (AQ and non-AQ). They also tend to have better standards of education quality, with higher average faculty salaries and faculty/student ratios, and consequently, they tend to exhibit a propensity for attracting higher-quality students, as evidenced by higher average SAT scores. Overall, schools in the AQ conferences are generally larger, have higher standards of education, and tend to attract superior students, consistent with the results of past cross-sectional studies (e.g., McCormick and Tinsley 1987) that find that schools with successful athletics programs tend to attract higher-quality students.
2.3. Model-Free Analysis Figure 2 shows the aggregate number of high school graduates in the United States over the past decade. The upward trend in the number of graduates is due mainly to the population increase in the relevant age bracket. To get a glimpse of how athletic success influences admissions, Figure 3(a) shows the number of applications received by the two main public universities in the state of Alabama, the University of Alabama and Auburn University. These two institutions are chosen for illustration because many consider them to be the greatest college football rivals in the United States, clashing each year

in the historic Iron Bowl.12 Both are public universities of roughly equal enrollment and academic ranking. In addition, college football is one of the biggest attractions, if not the biggest attraction, in the state of Alabama, with the BCS National Championship having been won by the University of Alabama in the 2009 season and Auburn University in the 2010 season. The early 2000s, during which the University of Alabama had to deal with NCAA sanctions for recruiting violations, are referred to as the dark ages in Crimson Tide football. During this period, Alabama lost the Iron Bowl to Auburn for seven consecutive years. Alabama's football program was rejuvenated in the latter years of the decade and has been on the national scene ever since. It was during this time that Alabama surpassed Auburn in the number of applications received.
The most established and well-known institution in college football is, arguably, the University of Notre Dame, with 13 recognized national championships under its belt and 96 All-Americans and 7 Heisman Trophy winners throughout its history. Notre Dame has had somewhat of a rollercoaster ride in the past decade in terms of football success. One can see in Table 2, which shows overall football wins per season for a select number of schools, that Notre Dame did quite well in the 2002, 2005, and 2006 seasons, with 10, 9, and 10 wins, respectively. Because the football season begins at the start of the academic year in

the fall and ends with the conclusion of the national championship game in early January, and applications for admission are usually submitted between late fall and early spring of the previous academic year, the effect (if any) of football success on the number of applications is expected to appear the following academic year.13 Figure 3(b) shows substantial increases in the number of applications in 2003, 2006, and 2007, the years immediately following Notre Dame's successful football seasons. Other years show only a limited increase, and in some instances a decrease, in the number of applications.
This phenomenon is not limited to the case of Notre Dame. Figure 3(c) shows the trend of applications at two large public institutions with rich traditions in football, the University of Texas and Pennsylvania State University. Similar to the application trends of Notre Dame, the number of applications for both Texas and Penn State increased significantly immediately following years of football success. Specifically, there was a huge increase in the number of applications for Texas in the year following the BCS National Championship at the end of the 2005 football season. Likewise, there was a huge increase in applications for Penn State in the year following its win in a BCS bowl game, the Orange Bowl, at the end of the 2005 football season.
Would this phenomenon hold for smaller schools with less history of football success prior to the recent decade? The University of Oregon and University of West Virginia, with their high-tempo powering offenses, have gained popularity among college football fans and enjoyed huge success on the football field during the past decade. Figure 3(d) shows application trends for both schools; clearly, the number of applications has risen substantially over the past decade, with peaks in the years following successful football seasons.
Finally, a glimpse of what happens when a less sports-affiliated institution (a member of the non-AQ conference) excels in athletics is given in Figure 3(b), which shows the number of applications for TCU over the past decade.14 We see a huge increase in applications, far greater than the increase in high school graduates shown in Figure 2. During this period, in contrast to previous decades, TCU did quite well on the field, being ranked in the top 10 twice and in the top 25 six times in the Final AP Poll.
One thing to consider is that there may have been a national temporal trend in the number of applications over the past decade as a result of record-low
13 A detailed description of timing is provided in the following section.
14 TCU was a member of the MWC. As of July 1, 2012, it became a member of one of the AQ conferences, the Big 12.

interest rates and the federal government's emphasis on postsecondary education. Figure 2 shows that the total number of applications for 1,277 U.S. institutions that offered associate degrees or above in the aggregate increased substantially. Additionally, Figure 2 shows the ratio of the number of applications to the total number of U.S. high school graduates over the past decade. The average number of applications per student increased steadily, from 1.4 applications per student in 2001 to 1.8 in 2009, possibly as a result of the macroeconomic variables mentioned previously.
To account for this trend, and to conduct a more general and conclusive analysis of the relation between football success and applications, Figure 4 presents a scatterplot and the best-fitting nonparametric smoothed polynomial (and its 95% confidence interval) of the fractional increase in applications (normalized by the total number of applications) against

the change in the number of wins compared to the previous season. Normalization was done by dividing the number of applications for each institution by the total number of applications in a given year to account for macroeconomic temporal changes. Hence, the y axis of Figure 4 is the fractional increase in the normalized number of applications; specifically,

One can see that when there is no significant change in football performance (near 0 on the x axis), changes in the number of applications are minimal. However, when there is a substantial

3. Model
I propose a model of demand for higher education that allows for heterogeneity in students' tastes for school and market characteristics. I treat athletics and its cumulative performance as a stock of goodwill that decays over time but augments with current performance, similar to that of advertising.15 In addition, I use order statistics to infer the quality of applicants from the observed distribution of the incoming freshman class and thus am able to formulate the relative importance of athletic success to students of different abilities.
3.1. Model of Application Choice Conditional on the Quality of Applicants
The choice of postsecondary education is probably the biggest decision most high school seniors have faced in their young lives. The decision of where to apply is likely based on factors related to the quality of education, such as the quality of faculty and faculty/student ratio, and probably also takes into account the opportunity costs of postsecondary education and costs related to attending a particular institution, which can take the form of monetary costs (primarily represented by tuition) or the psychological costs of being away from home. Factors such as the diversity of the student body and the goodwill
15 There have been numerous studies that deal with the longterm and carryover effects of advertising. These studies include de Kluyver and Brodie (1987), Givon and Horsky (1990), Dekimpe and Hanssens (1995), Lodish et al. (1995), Bruce (2008), and Rutz and Bucklin (2011). Clarke (1976) and Assmus et al. (1984) compare various models with regard to the long-term effect of advertising.

created by intercollegiate athletics may also impinge upon this decision.
Let the utility of person i with ability a residing in state s who decides to apply to institution j at time t be represented as Uiasjt. Obviously, the utility obtained from applying is not limited to simply "applying" but is more a continuation value expected from enrolling in the school. Assume that the utility is additively separable between a deterministic and random component, and hence, the utility function can be represented as

uaisjt =

where xsjkt is the kth observed characteristic of the market institution-specific vector xsjt; I define a market as the state in which a high school student cur-

rently resides.

is

the

(by the econometrician) utility component of j that is

common across all individuals (with ability a) and

across all markets, and

served utility component of j that is common across

all individuals with ability a in market s at time t. The

unobserved captures difficult-to-quantify aspects

(e.g., prestige, tradition, reputation) that affect the

demand of institution j;

a isjt

is

the

ran-

dom shock to utility that is assumed to be an inde-

pendently and identically distributed Type I extreme

value across individuals, states, schools, and time;

and psTjt is tuition costs, which are identical across markets for private institutions but differ by market for

public institutions. Specifically, for public institutions,

psTjt =

if institution j is in state s otherwise

where

pT sj t

and

p¯sTjt

represent

ated by past and current athletic performance, which

follows the process:

Gajt = aGaj t-1 + baAjt

(2)

where is the carryover rate (1 - can be thought of
as the decay rate), which is assumed to be 0 < < 1,
and Ajt is current athletic performance, which augments athletic goodwill. Recursively solving Equation (2) results in16

Gajt =

(3)

l=0

16 With regard to identification of the carryover rate , if a school has more than two periods (current + first lag) of football performance, one can uniquely identify the marginal effect of football success and carryover rate separately. If there are more than two periods, these periods would act as overidentifying restrictions; hence, can be more precisely identified.

I introduce individual-level preference heterogene-

ity by the sixth and seventh terms in Equation (1),

of which elements of are assumed to be distributed

(4)

One can think of

as

markets that influence choice. For example, in 2005,

Hurricane Katrina made it difficult for students in

Louisiana to apply to colleges. I capture individual-

level heterogeneity in the value of not applying to

school j by the second term in Equation (4). Because

the market shares in the logit model are a function

of the differences in utility from the outside option

(not to apply to j), naturally, in this formulation the

random coefficient on the intercept term of the utility

of option j captures the heterogeneity of the outside

option of not applying to j.

The utility function in Equation (1) can be decom-

posed as

By the distributional assumption on the idiosyn-

cratic shocks and the utility specification stated above,

the probability of individual i with ability a who

resides in state s applying to institution j is given as18

17 More precisely, the outside option here would be not applying to one of the 120 universities in Division I FBS. Thus, deciding to apply to an Ivy League school would be captured by the outside option.
18 The application decision is assumed to be independent across schools. This assumption may sound somewhat limited. However, since the cost of applications is extremely small compared with the cost of attendance, this assumption is not overly restrictive.

By integrating over the heterogeneity component, one can obtain the overall proportion of students of ability a in state s who applied to j:

for a student with

a multidimensional integral that has no closed-form

solution, one has to rely on simulations to obtain the

overall application shares.

4. Estimation
Based on the specification outlined in the previous section, I estimate a model of demand for higher education that allows different preferences for students of different academic ability. In doing so, I make the following key assumptions, which are necessary because of data limitations.
Assumption 1. The likelihood of a student applying to a school after sending standardized test scores is the same across schools' geographical locations (i.e., state).
Assumption 2. Schools stochastically choose to admit students based on the order of students' standardized test scores.
Assumption 3. A random proportion of admitted students decides to enroll.
Assumption 4. The distribution of standardized test scores of applicants for a school is identical across states, formally stated as follows: for school i, let Fji x and Fki x be the distributions of standardized test scores of applicants from states j and k, respectively; then, Fji x = Fki x .

4.1. Constructing Application Shares The IPEDS data contain the number of applications received by each institution in a given year. However, they do not contain the market (state) from which these applications originate. Therefore, the application shares (proportion of students in state s who applies to school j) are obtained by synchronizing the College Board SAT and IPEDS data--specifically, the percentage of SAT scores sent to each institution from each state and the number of applications each school received. I hereafter refer to application shares as the proportion of high school students in state s that sends applications to a particular institution; this is formally defined as

Number of high school students

from state s who applies to institution j)

Ssjt =

Total number of high school

students (seniors) in state s

688

Naturally, these shares will not sum to one because

an individual may choose to apply to more than one

school; thus the term "share" is somewhat awkward.

The application share can be thought of as the pro-

portion of students who consider school j and hence

apply to j from the total number of high school stu-

dents in state s.

The College Board SAT data contain the exact num-

ber of SAT score reports sent to any institution from a

particular state. Although merely sending one's SAT

score report to a school is not the same as applying

(but would probably be a superset), knowing the ratio

of the SAT score reports sent to an institution from a

specific state and the total number of applications the

institution received, we can infer for each institution

the number of applications that come from a partic-

ular state. Specifically, suppose there are S markets

and J institutions. Let the ratio of SAT score reports

sent from students in market s to institution j be

s j

,

formally defined as

s j

=

Number of students in s who sent SAT scores to j Total number of students in s who sent SAT scores

In addition, let the total market size (i.e., total num-

ber of high school graduates) of state s be Ms and

the total number of applications received by j be Aj .

Because

s j

reflects

the

popularity

(in

applications)

of

school j among students in s who have decided to

apply to colleges, by Assumption 1, I can obtain the

number of applications coming from state s for insti-

tution j by utilizing this ratio and weighing it by the

total number of high school students in each state s

that have decided to apply to colleges, such that

Asj =

s j

·

Ms

s

s r =1

r j

·

Mr

r · Aj

(6)

where s is the proportion of students in state s who
apply to postsecondary educational institutions; thus, Ms s represents the number of students in state s who apply to colleges. For s, I use the college-going
rate by state per year from the NCHEMS Informa-
tion Center, which represents the proportion of high school students in each state that goes to college.19 For
clarification, I illustrate in the appendix how I con-
struct application shares.

4.2. Order Statistics to Infer the Quality of Applicants
Federal law protects the data associated with individual information about applicants to each institution

19 The college-going and college-applying rates can be different because one can apply to colleges but decide to not go; thus, the latter would be slightly higher. However, if there are no systematic differences between the two ratios across states, then the former would be a good proxy for the latter in the context of Equation (6).

Chung: The Dynamic Advertising Effect of Collegiate Athletics Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 679­698, © 2013 INFORMS

of higher education in the United States.20 Thus, I can obtain data on the quality of students (based on SAT scores) only for the enrolled student population for each academic institution in my sample. Relying on this information along with the admission rate, I use order statistics to infer the quality of the applicants.
Schools take into account standardized test scores as well as other dimensions of quality when making their admission decisions. Thus, a typical admission rule would be a probabilistic function with regard to standardized test scores. If the admitted and the applicant distributions are observed, we can infer the admission rule to be

Pr A

x

f =

x ApA fx

(7)

where A denotes admission; thus, f x A and f x are the probability density functions of standardized test scores for admitted students and applicants, respectively, and p A is the unconditional admission probability. Likewise, if the admitted distribution and admission rule are observed, we can back out the applicant distribution. However, because only the distribution of standardized test scores conditional on admission f x A and the unconditional admission probability p A are observed as a result of privacy regulations, I have to rely on distributional assumptions to infer the applicant distribution f x . Hence, as in Assumption 2, I assume that each institution stochastically chooses to admit students based on the order of their standardized test scores. Because each institution wants to attract students of higher quality, this assumption does not seem unreasonable. This assumption, however, does not mean that a school chooses to admit students based solely on standardized test scores; instead, it means that a school also takes into account other dimensions of quality not captured by standardized test scores, as explained in detail below.
Suppose that a certain institution admits n - k + 1 out of n applicants (where 1  k  n). Assuming that the school stochastically chooses n - k + 1 out of n students based on the order of their standardized test scores, we can construct an order statistics distribution from any underlying distribution.21 Let Xi be a random variable (standardized test score) that has a probability density function f x and cumulative distribution function F x . If one were to randomly draw n samples from this distribution and arrange them

20 To obtain individual-level information (SAT scores) on students who applied to institutions, one would need permission from each academic institution and from each applicant.
21 Interested readers can refer to Sarhan and Greenberg (1962), David (1981), Balakrishnan and Cohen (1991), Arnold et al. (1992), and Harter and Balakrishnan (1996, 1997).

in a nondecreasing order, one would obtain the cor-

responding order statistics X1 n X2 n

Xn n. These

order statistics are naturally random variables whose

distribution is a function of the underlying distribu-

tion. Specifically, the probability density function for

the kth order statistics is given as

fk n x

n! k-1 ! n-k

and the probability density function for the k  n bracket of order statistics as

f k n n x = n - k + 1 r=k fr n x

Because the school chooses n - k + 1 out of n applicants, the distribution of k  n bracket of order statistics would represent the distribution of the admitted f x A in Equation (7). Hence, the distribution of the admitted would be a function of the underlying applicant distribution f x and unconditional admission probability p A such that

This rule is quite intuitive. Suppose a school admits half of its applicants; thus, n = 2 and k = 2. Then, the admission rule is simply the cumulative distribution function F x , which is an increasing function of standardized test scores. That is, higher standardized test scores lead to higher admission probabilities. If another school admits a third of its applicants so that n = 3 and k = 3, the admission rule would be F x 2. Hence, if the two schools have identical applicant pools given by the same distribution F x , the latter school would be more selective with stricter admission rules ( F x 2  F x for all x . Overall, the order statistics distributional assumption presumes that schools' admission decisions typically take into account other dimensions of quality as well as standardized test scores, consistent with actual admission

selection rules. For clarification, I provide an illustrative example with regards to Assumption 2 and the use of order statistics in the online appendix (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2013.0795).
Using the order statistics distribution, I can recover the underlying distribution of applicant quality. Specifically, assuming the SAT scores for applicants at institution j to be normally distributed with mean j and variance j2, I can match the order statistics distribution that best fits the data to recover the underlying distribution of applicants.22
I observe the first and the third quartiles of the SAT scores for the enrolled freshmen class along with the admission rate and, hence, use this information to construct a minimum-distance estimator to recover the parameters of the underlying distribution function. For example, suppose that institution j admits 30% of its applicants. This would mean that 3 out of 10 applicants based on the order of their standardized test scores are stochastically admitted. If the first and third quartiles of the SAT scores are Qj25 and Qj75, respectively, then we can find the parameters of the underlying distribution function by minimizing the minimum distance estimator; thus,

where, in the current example, k = 8 and n = 10. Figure 5 graphically illustrates this procedure. Because, by Assumption 3, I am assuming that a random proportion of the admitted students decides to enroll, the SAT score distributions of the admitted and enrolled students are identical. Hence, from the distributional information of the enrolled students, I can obtain the mass of applicants via their SAT scores.
Assumption 3 indicates that, after being admitted, the choice of enrollment is not a function of

22 The minimum and maximum SAT scores are 400 and 1,600, respectively. Thus, in practice, the underlying distribution is assumed to come from a truncated normal distribution.

SAT scores. Figure 6 shows for a large public university on the East Coast, with academic characteristics similar to those of the majority of schools in the current analysis, the SAT score distributions of students who applied, admitted, and enrolled. As the figure shows, the distributions of the admitted and enrolled look quite similar. Furthermore, the average SAT scores for the admitted and enrolled--1,173 and 1,155, respectively--differ only slightly. This probably reflects a degree of self-selection based on students' ability when making application decisions, and thus, enrollment decisions from the subset of schools to which they have been admitted are more of a horizontal than vertical choice.23 Interestingly, the shape of the SAT score distribution for the applied, admitted, and enrolled is remarkably consistent with Assumptions 2 and 3, providing empirical validity to the approach taken to recover the applicant distribution.
I observe the SAT score distribution of students in each market and can infer (by Equation (6)) the number of students from each state who applied to each school. Using this information, together with the distribution of the SAT scores of applicants for each school, I am able to construct the application shares for any ability level in each market. In practice, I construct the application shares by five evenly divided segments based on the overall SAT score distribution. In constructing the application shares by ability segment, as in Assumption 4, I assume a school's SAT distribution of applicants to be identical across states. Although this assumption seems reasonable for private schools, it may be somewhat problematic for
23 As an alternative, I tested a different selection rule that utilizes another layer of order statistics to allow for different SAT score distributions of admitted and enrolled students. Using this approach did not change the fundamental results of the current analysis.

public schools. Because public institution applicants come predominantly from their home state, however, this assumption would likely not significantly bias the estimates. Figure 7 shows the probability distribution of public schools and composition of students (percentage of in-state students).24 One can see that the student bodies of most public schools in Division I FBS are composed mostly of in-state students. In more than 35% of the public schools, 90% or more of the students are from the home state. In only 10% of the public schools is there a student body made up of fewer than 70% in-state students, and no schools have fewer than 62% of students from the home state.
To further validate this assumption, Figure 8 shows the SAT score (math) distribution for in-state and outof-state students enrolling at an anonymous, midsize, East Coast public institution. Roughly 10% of the institution's incoming freshmen class was from out of state. Although the out-of-state distribution seems to be skewed slightly toward the right, there is only a small difference between the in-state and out-of-state distributions. The difference in SAT scores between in-state and out-of-state students was likewise minimal, with average SAT scores (for math and reading) for in-state and out-of-state students being 1,123 and 1,139, respectively.
4.3. Estimation Procedure To estimate the model parameters, I use the generalized method of moments (GMM; see Hansen 1982), a generic method of estimating parameters in an econometric model without relying on any distributional assumptions on the statistical error structure.

The GMM accommodates the use of instrumental variables to correct for the likely correlation between certain variables (e.g., price) and the unobserved errors. However, in the current structure, because the unobserved error component enters the share equation in (5) nonlinearly, it is not feasible to directly apply the instrumental variables technique. I therefore use the approach of Berry et al. (1995), which has been widely applied in the marketing literature (e.g., Sudhir 2001, Gordon and Hartmann 2013).25
For the initial value of goodwill Gaj0, one can structure a distributional assumption and integrate over it or, with a long enough time series in the panel and the belief that the carryover rate is relatively small, start off with some initial number. The length of the time series of the IPEDS and College Board SAT data in my sample is for 9 years (2001­2009) and that of the athletics data is for 15 years (1996­2010). Having sufficient past athletic performance data, I use the information from the entire history of athletic performance to set the initial goodwill stock as

in the estimation procedure.

4.4. Choice of Variables and Instruments For school characteristics, I use the average faculty salary and faculty/student ratio, variables commonly used in the literature to control for quality of education. I use the distance in miles from a student's home state to an institution for school-market characteristics to take into account any psychological and monetary costs of being away from home. Furthermore, I use the annual borrowing rate to account for the opportunity cost of postsecondary education.
I use the number of football wins in a season for current athletic performance. As noted in §2.2, the

25 I direct readers to Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000, 2001) for details of the estimation procedure.

more wins in a season, the more likely a team is to receive greater media exposure; therefore, the total number of wins in a season is a good proxy for current athletic success. The college football season ends in early January with the conclusion of the BCS National Championship game. For teams that do not qualify for postseason bowl games (teams with fewer than six regular-season wins), the season ends around Thanksgiving Day with the conclusion of their main rivalry games. For teams that qualify for a bowl game, the season ends with the conclusion of the bowl game, sometime in late December or early January. Application packets, although they vary by institution and individual, are usually submitted around this time for the next academic year. So I use as a measure of current athletic performance the previous academic year's overall football wins.
The unobserved (by the econometrician, but fully observed by student and school) time-varying common component , which represents difficult-toquantify features, may be correlated with tuition. Although it is merely a given fact that, with profitmaximizing firms, prices are correlated with , this is somewhat less obvious with educational institutions. It is highly unlikely that tuition is a flexible decision variable that one can systematically change over a short period of time. Nevertheless, I use the previous two years' tuition as instruments for current tuition.
By using an extensive set of school fixed effects, I am able to capture omitted or unobserved characteristics of quality and, thus, partially address the endogeneity problem related to athletic success. However,
, which represents time-specific deviations, can be endogenous with athletic goodwill. To further address the endogeneity concern with regard to and athletic goodwill G, let us discuss the possible factors that construct the unobserved . One can think of
as any media exposure that is not observed in the data. A successful movie filmed on campus or special event, such as a presidential debate, would fall into this category. Because such events likely occur randomly, the endogeneity problem is probably not a big concern.
The endogeneity issue is likely to be a problem if we think of as investments, or the maturity of investments, such as the opening of a new residence hall or academic facility. Because the goodwill stock of athletics is a function of historical athletic success, and athletic success is likely a function of past investments in athletics, there may be a chance that and G are correlated. This is probably not the case, though, for several reasons. First, in most of the schools in my sample, budgets for athletics and academics are separate, as indicated in the 2009 report issued by the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which found presidents of

major universities to have limited control over athletic department budgets (Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics 2009). Second, creating a strong athletics program predominantly takes longer than building facilities. Thus, although decisions to invest in academic facilities and athletics may be correlated, because of the timing difference in the maturity of investments, the endogeneity concern is less severe, further reducing the endogeneity problem. Hence, I believe that endogeneity is not a major concern in my model specification.
5. Results
I begin by showing the results of the static model in which the carryover rate is set to 0, and thus, athletic goodwill is just a linear function of current athletic performance. Table 3 shows for two specifications the results of the static model without individual heterogeneity in taste or ability. These specifications would be the same as an ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression with the natural log of odds as the dependent variable-- homogeneous aggregate logit.
The results show athletic performance to have a significantly positive effect. Average faculty salary, which acts as a proxy for the quality of faculty, is positive and significant. The faculty/student ratio is positive but insignificant, possibly because of limited variation in the size of the faculty or student body; thus, most of the effect will be absorbed by the school fixed effects. Both tuition and distance are negative and significant, implying that students receive disutility from both the monetary cost of tuition and the psychological cost of being away from home. The interest rate is negative and significant, suggesting that students value the opportunity cost with regard to postsecondary education.

The results of the OLS and 2SLS do not differ much.

The elasticity of tuition increases slightly with the use

of instrumental variables but not as much as found

in other studies in which the magnitude of increase is

as much as twofold (e.g., Berry et al. 1995, Villas-Boas

and Winer 1999). This is probably because tuition may

be close to being exogenous and is not as much of

a flexible control variable that can be easily adjusted

over a short period of time as prices are for profit-

maximizing firms.26

Table 4(a) shows the results of the static model with

heterogeneity in both taste and ability. To allow for

heterogeneity in taste for athletic success, I include a

random coefficient for current athletic performance.

I further partition the student population into five evenly divided segments based on overall SAT scores and construct applicant shares by each market segment to estimate segment-level parameters. The range of SAT scores for the different segments is shown at the top of Table 4(a). Athletic performance is positive and significant for all segments. Average faculty salary is also positive and significant. However, the mean utility parameter for athletic performance is greatest for students with low SAT scores and smallest for students with high SAT scores. The magnitude is as much as three times as large for the lowest as for the highest ability segment, implying that athletic success is relatively more important to students with low

academic ability. We can clearly see that the relative importance of athletic performance decreases with students' SAT scores, implying that students with higher ability are less enthusiastic about (although not unappreciative of) the success of a school's athletic program than are lower-ability students.
With regard to the quality of education, the relative importance of average faculty salary, which proxies for quality of faculty, increases with SAT scores, indicating that the demand for high-quality education increases with students' academic ability. The effect of the faculty/student ratio, although insignificant for all segments, dramatically increases with student ability, again implying that higher-ability students care relatively more about academics than their lower-ability counterparts do.
The coefficients on tuition and distance are all negative and highly significant. The effect of interest rate is negative and significant for all segments, with the highest-ability segment being the most sensitive. Although this result may come as a surprise, it makes intuitive sense, in that students with higher ability probably have a greater opportunity cost with regard to postsecondary education. The heterogeneity parameters are, for the most part, insignificant, except for tuition and distance for a number of segments. Even for the significant parameters the magnitude is negligibly small, showing close to no heterogeneity in taste. It is probably the case that the extensive set of school fixed effects is absorbing most of the heterogeneity. Although all students are positively affected by a school's success on the field--surprisingly, even the highest-quality students are--its relative importance is stronger for students with lower ability.

An alternative approach to incorporate (continuous) observed heterogeneity would be to draw student quality from the observed SAT distribution and interact it with the athletic performance variable, the number of wins. The results of this model specification are reported in Table 4(b). The interaction term with regard to SAT scores and football success is negative and significant, consistent with the results of the model that incorporates discrete-level observed heterogeneity.27
Table 5 shows the results of the dynamic model, for which I allow for heterogeneity only in student ability since the heterogeneity parameters on taste in the static model show that it is negligible. Athletic performance is again highly significant for all segments, with the lowest segment showing a much stronger preference than the higher-ability segments. The carryover rate is significant for only the lower-ability segments, implying that athletic goodwill from the previous years remains relevant only to students with low ability.
5.1. Counterfactual Analysis The natural counterfactual to perform is to determine how significant athletic success is in attracting potential candidates to apply to a specific institution. Table 6, panel (a) shows the following "what-if" scenario: What happens if a mid-level school that used to have a mediocre football team suddenly performs well on the field, with everything else held constant?28
27 I thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this robustness check.
28 I define a mid-level school as one with median fixed effects estimates.

I define a "mediocre" performance as winning only 4 games per season and performing "well" as winning 10 games per season, both in the previous two years. Overall, applications increase by 17.7% when a school has a higher level of athletic success. However, most applicants come from the lower-ability segments. To match the increase in total number of applications absent athletic success, a school would have to decrease tuition by 3.8% or attract higher-quality faculty who would be paid 5.1% more in the academic labor market. Of course, because of differences in preferences for academic quality and athletic success on the part of students of different ability, the composition of applicants will be different depending on whether the increase results from lower tuition, improved academic quality, or athletic success. Panels (b) and (c) in Table 6 show the percentage increases in applications by students of different ability when the quality of faculty improves and tuition falls, respectively, to equal the increase in applications from success on the field. One can see that the increase in applications is spread more evenly among segments when tuition decreases and that improvement in the quality of faculty affects high-ability students more than low-ability students. These findings are in contrast to the effect of athletic success on different ability segments. Moreover, each additional win for a school results in an additional loss for another school. Hence, this counterfactual exercise potentially underestimates the effect of athletic success.29
29 I thank an anonymous reviewer for this comment.

Building on this analysis, the next apparent counterfactual is to look at how athletic success affects the selectivity of schools. Schools care about selectivity-- particularly, the admissions rate, which is used as a key evaluation criterion in determining the quality rankings of academic institutions. Table 7 shows the computed admissions rates of schools in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, in accordance with their average SAT scores, with low and high athletic success, defined as winning 4 and 10 games per season in the previous two years, respectively.
In computing this counterfactual, I keep the observed (estimated via order statistics) school's admission rates, which are different for each segment, constant. The logic behind this counterfactual is that schools making admissions decisions are not basing their evaluations on SAT scores alone. Other factors go into the decision-making process, such as high school grades and extracurricular activities. The admissions rate I observe in the data for each segment corresponds with this admissions policy.30 For example, suppose a school's admissions rate in the lowestability segment is 15%. This means that, although the students in this segment have relatively low SAT scores, 15% possess other dimensions of quality (mentioned above) that make them worthwhile for the school to attract. This form of admissions policy takes into account the policies of schools that are sometimes required, by state law, to admit students that surpass a certain quality level (not necessarily SAT scores).31 Because I observe (estimated via order statistics) the SAT score distribution of applicants and admittees, I can compute the actual admissions rates for each ability (SAT) segment for each school. I compute the total admissions rates for low and high athletic success, keeping the school's segment-level admissions rates constant.
Table 7 shows that both private and public schools gain in selectivity through athletic success. For the
30 This admissions policy is consistent with the assumption regarding the use of order statistics distribution to back out the distribution of applicant SAT scores in §4.2.
31 Texas House Bill 588 (commonly referred to as the "Top 10% Rule"), passed in 1997, guarantees Texas students who graduate in the top 10% of their high school class automatic admission to all state-funded universities.

median private school (in terms of average SAT scores), selectivity rates improve by 1.1 percentage points and by 2.6 percentage points for the median public school.
6. Conclusion
Intercollegiate athletics has experienced an exponential growth in popularity over the past several decades and now plays a large part in the lives of many people in the United States. Colleges and universities benefit from intercollegiate athletics through monetary gain from ticket and merchandise sales and lucrative television contracts, as well as through advertising in the form of exposure in multimedia outlets.
The advertising effect of intercollegiate athletics was first speculated in the years following Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie's infamous gamewinning Hail Mary touchdown pass against the University of Miami in 1984, after which Boston College witnessed a substantial increase in applications. As a result, the mass media coined the term "Flutie effect" to refer to an increase in the exposure and prominence of an academic institution resulting from the success of its athletics program. The Flutie effect, although conjectured to be quite large in magnitude, has surprisingly not been fully investigated in the academic literature. This study empirically investigates the Flutie effect to determine the relative importance of a school's athletic success compared to other factors that influence the choice of schools for students of different abilities.
To investigate the advertising effect of intercollegiate athletics, I apply a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model, and I treat athletic success and its cumulative performance as a stock of goodwill that decays over time but that augments with current performance. Unlike previous research that relies solely on aggregate data, I use market-level data to adequately control for different factors that affect a student's choice of postsecondary education at the market level. Furthermore, to overcome data limitations stemming from privacy regulations, I innovate and contribute to the broader line of research in discrete choice models by using an order statistics distribution to infer the quality of applicants from the observed distribution of the enrolling freshman class. This enables me to identify different preferences for students of different ability.
Overall, I find that athletic success has a significant impact on the quality and quantity of applicants to institutions of higher education in the United States. I find athletic success to be relatively more important to students of lower ability and find students of higher ability to have a stronger preference for

the quality of education compared with their lowerability counterparts. Furthermore, the carryover rate of athletic goodwill is evident only for students with low SAT scores, suggesting that students with low ability value the historical success of intercollegiate athletics over longer periods of time. Nevertheless, and surprisingly, students with high SAT scores are also significantly affected by athletic success.
I further find that when a school goes from being mediocre to performing well on the football field, applications increase by 17.7%. To achieve similar effects, a school would have to either decrease its tuition by 3.8% or increase the quality of its education by recruiting higher-quality faculty who are paid 5.1% more in the academic labor market. I also find that schools become more selective with athletic success. For a mid-level school, in terms of average SAT scores, the admissions rate improves by 4.8% with high-level athletic success.
Why would athletic success have any impact on an academic institution's applications for admission? There may be several reasons. First, this effect may be due simply to an increase in awareness. There are many academic institutions in the United States, and chances are that many of them are fairly unknown. So having a successful athletics program could increase the visibility of these institutions to students who have not yet decided on which school to apply. Even for schools that are fairly well known, the buzz generated by performance on the field can lead to stories on the evening news and in the sports pages of newspapers that may further increase awareness of these schools.
One can go a bit deeper, though. Sports are a big part of American culture. It is common for people in the United States to make the sporting events of their alumni institutions the focal point of their social interactions. Students may find it appealing to take part in such social bonding over sports in order to feel as though they are a part of something special, something bigger than themselves. This can lead to a virtuous cycle of improved alumni engagement with the school that translates into donations and help with job placement for current students, all of which enhances the school's success. Although not addressed in the current analysis, the question of "why" students value intercollegiate athletics could be an exciting venue for future research.

Appendix. Obtaining Application Shares-- Illustrative Example This section provides an illustrative example of constructing application shares in Equation (6) utilizing multiple data sources. Let us assume that there are two states (Ohio and Michigan) and one school in each state (OSU for Ohio State University and UM for the University of Michigan). We observe how many SAT score reports were sent to OSU and UM from Ohio and likewise from Michigan. We also observe the total number of SAT score senders from Ohio and Michigan.
The areas in Figure A.1 represent the number of high school seniors in each state (M OHIO and M MICHIGAN and the number of students who applied to each school from each state (AOOHSUIO AOUMHIO AMUMICHIGAN, and AMOSICUHIGAN); that is, AOOHSUIO is the number of students who applied to OSU from Ohio. OHIO and MICHIGAN represent the collegeapplying rates for Ohio and Michigan, respectively. Hence,
OHIOM OHIO would be the number of students in Ohio who applied to colleges, which is represented by the square area inside the area of MOHIO. From the data, we only observe M OHIO M MICHIGAN, AOSU AUM, OHIO, MICHIGAN but we want to find AOOHSUIO to construct our dependent variable.
We do not observe AOOHSUIO, but we observe the fraction of SAT scores sent to OSU from the state of Ohio:

OHIO OSU

=

Number of students in Ohio who sent SAT scores to OSU Total number of students in Ohio who sent SAT scores

which represents the relative popularity of OSU to Ohio students who decided to send SAT scores to any school (i.e., apply to colleges). Weighing this probability by the number of high school students in Ohio who applies to colleges,
OHIOM OHIO we can obtain AOOHSUIO:

AOOHSUIO =

As a result, we can obtain the application share, SOHIO OSU = AOOHSUIO/M OHIO. So, numerically, if the number of high school

tively; the number of applications that OSU received is

and OHIO and MICHIGAN are both 0.5, AOOHSUIO would be cal-

culated as follows:

000 × 0 5

× 20 000 = 16 552

So, of the 20,000 applicants for OSU, we can infer that 16,552 would be coming from Ohio; hence, SOHIO OSU = 16 552/120 000 = 0 138.
In summary, I observe the exact number of applicants for each school and decompose this number by the state from which it comes for my empirical application. In doing so, I use the information on the relative popularity of a school in each state weighted by the total number of high school students who applies to colleges for the corresponding state.
