Recent research studies have shown that, in the aggregate, survey participation is associated with increased purchase behaviors. Whereas selective customer response could be responsible for some of this correlation, we conclude that survey participation does cause changes in purchase behavior. On the basis of this conclusion, we investigate the possible differential impact of participating in a firm-sponsored satisfaction survey on (1) services purchases, (2) responsiveness to promotions, (3) interpurchase time, and (4) spending, across customers. We develop a joint model of these four customer behaviors and explicitly examine the role of customer characteristics and store-specific variables in moderating the effects of survey participation. We also study how these effects change over time.
The data used for the analysis come from a longitudinal field study of customer satisfaction conducted by a U.S. automotive services firm. It contains two groups of customers. One group was administered a customer satisfaction survey and the other was not. Our results reveal a substantial positive relationship between satisfaction survey participation and all the customer behaviors studied. Assuming a causal relationship, we also find the effects of satisfaction survey participation to vary across customers and stores, and over time.

1. Introduction and Research Motivation
Professional marketing researchers tend to think of their work as primarily eliciting customer opinions and as separate from influencing customer opinions or behaviors. Yet a growing number of research studies reveal that such a distinction is, for the most part, an artificial one. They show that even when survey research is conducted without any overt intent to influence customers, it is still associated with significant and broad-based changes in customers' behaviors regarding the firm.
Research on this issue can be traced to the findings on the mere measurement effect, which revealed that simply asking customers their purchase intentions can significantly change their subsequent purchase behaviors in product categories such as cars and personal computers (Morwitz et al. 1993).
More recently, Dholakia and Morwitz (2002; D&M henceforth) extended this finding to firm-sponsored satisfaction surveys. They conducted a field study of U.S. financial services customers participating in a firm-sponsored telephone-based satisfaction survey, and found that surveyed customers opened significantly more accounts after the survey, were more profitable, and had lower defection rates when

compared to a control group of similar customers who had not participated in the survey. The intergroup differences in new account openings, profitability, and loyalty behaviors between the surveyed and the control groups were observable even up to a year after the survey.
Chandon et al. (2004; CMR henceforth) generalized these findings to online grocery purchases. They conducted their field study with customers of a French online grocer and found that customers who responded to three purchase intentions questions via a telephone survey sponsored by the firm made their first repeat purchase sooner, relative to similar nonparticipants, were more likely to make repeat purchases for up to three months postsurvey and were more profitable to the firm over the course of a ninemonth period.1
Prior research has argued that such effects of survey participation occur for two reasons. One reason is that survey participation often induces respondents to form judgments regarding the sponsoring firm and its products or services that they otherwise would
1 It is worth noting here that in these research studies, the authors only provided correlational and logical evidence of causality. We discuss this issue in more detail in §5.

not have formed in the absence of survey questioning (Feldman and Lynch 1988). These measurementinduced judgments remain accessible in customers' memories, and influence their postsurvey behavior (Fitzsimons and Williams 2000, Morwitz and Fitzsimons 2004). A second reason is that the survey provides a useful source of information regarding the firm to many customers. It generates positive inferences regarding the firm's customer orientation and responsiveness, and it positively influences postsurvey behaviors (Dholakia et al. 2005). Recently, Janiszewski and Chandon (2007) argued that in addition to any effect that attitude accessibility might have, the effect of asking an intention question also serves to make the target behavior more perceptually fluent; this fluency contributes to the mere measurement effect.
From a practical standpoint, these findings are important, because they suggest that survey-based marketing research projects do not simply incur costs for the sake of gaining insights into customer sperceptions as is conventionally believed, but they might bring in additional revenues through such avenues as increased sales, reduced defection, and other positive behaviors by the respondents. At the same time, these studies also raise a host of interesting and important questions that still remain to be answered. Some of these questions that form the focus of this research are these: Do the effects of survey participation extend to customers' subsequent responsiveness to the firm's promotions? How are these effects affected by customer and store characteristics? How do these effects vary over time?
Our objective in this paper is to develop and estimate a joint customer behavior model to answer these questions. Such an analysis is important for several reasons: It enhances our understanding of the potential effects of survey participation on a firm's customers. The insights so obtained might allow for a more accurate accounting of the net cost (or gain) of individual customer satisfaction research projects, given a particular composition of respondents.2
In this paper, we consider two types of variables that might help uncover individual differences in susceptibility to survey participation influences: customer characteristics, and characteristics of the firm. First, attributes of the customers themselves could determine the extent to which they are susceptible to the influences of survey participation. We refer to these factors as customer characteristics. They include variables such as the customer's tenure with the firm and the age of his or her car, in addition to conventional demographic variables such as age, gender, household income, and household size.
2 However, this would require additional analysis not presented here.

Second, firm characteristics are also likely to play a role in how survey participation affects customers subsequently. Because the firm in our study is a national chain store providing automotive services, customers purchase products by visiting the firm's individual stores. Our data set and analysis are also at the individual service-visit level. Consequently, several store-level variables are included in our analysis, such as whether the store was company owned or franchisee owned, whether it had a customer lounge, the number of service bays in the store, and a measure of throughput times at the store.
Apart from these two types of variables (customer and store characteristics), we also investigate the likely effects of survey participation over time. That is, how long does it take for the survey participation effect to begin wearing off?3 Finally, in addition to dependent measures related to purchase (number of services purchased, purchase frequency, and amount spent on each visit), we explicitly study the potential impact of survey participation on customers' subsequent promotion responsiveness (number of coupons redeemed).
Our analysis reveals a number of interesting factors that moderate the likely effects of survey participation on respondents. Some key findings follow: The household size, income, and newness of the customer's vehicle increase the potential impact. The customer's age as well as tenure with the firm diminishes this effect. The company-owned stores gain more (as compared to franchisee-owned stores) from the survey participation effect. We also investigate the time trend in potential impact of survey participation on the four behaviors and find that the likely impact on purchase frequency is much delayed when compared to the effects on other customer behaviors.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, we introduce the data in more depth and then explain the model and discuss the results in §§3 and 4, respectively. Finally, in §5, we discuss the managerial implications of our findings along with some of the limitations of this study.
2. The Data
The data come from a large-scale survey, conducted by a leading U.S. automotive services firm, and cover the period from January 2001 to April 2003. This firm has an ongoing survey-based customer satisfaction tracking program; it randomly selects customers for participation in the survey within seven days of a service visit. Customers who participate in the survey do
3 Although prior studies such as those of CMR and D&M have studied time effects on dependent variables, the analysis there was done at an aggregate level, analyzing each dependent variable separately.

not receive another survey for at least one year after their participation. Of all the customers who participated and responded to the satisfaction survey during the first quarter (January­March) of 2002, a random sample of 3,773 single-automobile4 active5 customers was drawn. In the discussion that follows, we refer to these customers as the experimental group. A second random sample of 1,227 single-automobile active customers, who had purchased service at least once during the first quarter of 2002 but were not surveyed by the firm, forms the control group. Thus, we use a total of 5,000 customers (3,773 experimental group and 1,227 control group) in our analysis. Due to the selection of the data sample as described, our conclusions from the study are valid for regular customers only.
The survey was conducted by telephone; it first identified the firm as the survey's sponsor, and then asked, among others, a question regarding the customer's overall satisfaction with the service visit.6
In the present study, the firm averaged contact response rates in the range of 90%­95% (i.e., 90%­95% of contacted people responded to the survey).7 However, the firm did not collect data on how many of the customers chosen for the survey it was able to reach. Consultations with the market research vendor and experience with other such studies led us to believe that contact rates were between 60% and 70%, leading to a net response rate (i.e., percentage of chosen customers responding to the survey) between 54% and 67%.
We gathered detailed behavioral information for these 5,000 customers in our data sample from the firm's database for approximately a year prior to the survey period and a year afterward. This procedure yielded a data set with a total of 35,866 service visits or purchase occasions.
4 We excluded multiple-automobile households from the analysis to prevent unknown factors from contaminating our results, e.g., the possibility that the person purchasing the service might not be the automobile's owner, that the patterns of intrahousehold communication influence the survey respondent, or other forms of interpersonal influence.
5 We defined customers as active when they had at least one service visit during the period of the analysis (January 2001­April 2003), and if they had at least five service visits to the firm's stores during the seven-year period of January 1996 to December 2002, so all our analysis is restricted to the more regular customers of the firm.
6 The surveyed customers indicated high satisfaction levels on this measure, with the average satisfaction score (on a 10-point scale) being 8.3 (s.d. = 1 9).
7 Since this rate seemed high, we verified this by using data available to us from the last weeks of two recent quarters. We found response rates of 89.9% and 95.3% in these two time periods. This high response rate could be due to the nature of the product involved. Automobiles are high involvement products and expensive to maintain. They form an important part of a person's life, and hence customers might take more interest in the survey directly concerning their vehicle.

The data consist of four dependent measures of customer behavior: (1) the number of promotions redeemed by a customer on each visit (customers have access to the promotional coupons of the firm through multiple sources8 and this variable captures the extent to which these promotions are redeemed by them); (2) the number of automotive services purchased on each visit (the firm provides various maintenance services such as brake service, transmission service, oil changes, etc.); (3) time since the last visit in days (interpurchase time); and (4) the amount spent during each visit.
Figure 1 provides histogram plots of these four dependent measures across the 35,866 service visits. Panels A and B in Figure 1 are histograms of the number of promotions redeemed and the number of services bought on each service visit, respectively, while panels C and D are histogram plots of the interpurchase times and the purchase amounts, respectively.
On a majority of the visits (52.1% of the visits) no promotions are redeemed; if promotions are redeemed, most of the time (44.4%) only a single promotion is redeemed. Multiple promotions are redeemed on fewer than 5% of the service visits. In other words, the variance in number of promotions redeemed across service visits is relatively low. On the other hand, the number of services bought on each occasion (panel B) shows a greater variance. Although a single service is purchased on a majority of the visits (57.5% occasions), buying multiple services is not uncommon; on about 16.4% of the visits, three or more different services were bought by the customer.
On average, the interpurchase time is 103 days, and the purchase amount on each visit is $42 for the sample (panels C and D in Figure 1). However, as seen in the plots, there is considerable heterogeneity in these measures.
Table 1(a) contains the summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) for these four dependent measures across four groups: the control group in the periods before and after the survey, and the experimental group before and after the survey.
Simple tests for differences in means across the groups do not indicate any significant differences between the control and experimental groups in the period prior to the survey on two of the four dependent measures (number of services bought and the purchase amount). For the remaining two dependent measures, there is a significant difference indicating that any modeling effort should control for these differences (which we do, as explained in §3).

Tests9 to infer the effect of survey done on this aggregate data yield positive survey effects in the interpurchase time behavior (i.e., the interpurchase time decreases postsurvey). However, the tests fail to detect any difference on the other three behaviors. This is at best a partial indication of the existence of the survey effect. The data are a combination of longitudinal and survey data. Thus, they are not generated by a laboratory experiment wherein the researcher can carefully control confounding effects. Therefore, to generate valid inferences, we need to use sophisticated individual level statistical models. This is what we attempt in setting up a model to make inferences from the available data. The model is introduced in §3.
Apart from these four dependent measures, the data also contained a host of customer and storespecific variables. Table 1(b) provides some summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the customer-specific variables across the two groups.
In the next section, we build a joint model for these four dependent measures and introduce customer characteristics and store-specific measures to study the differential impact of survey participation across

these four measures of customer behavior in depth. Using an individual-level model (as opposed to an aggregate model) becomes important because one of our goals is to also study the differential effects of survey participation across individuals and stores, based on various individual-specific and store-specific characteristics.

(TIMEht , and the dollar amount spent (AMNTht by customer h on purchase occasion t. The approach followed in building the joint model is to impose distributional assumptions on each of these four dependent variables and then allow a correlation structure across the four distributions.
The distributional assumptions are as follows:

PROMht  CMP 1ht 1

(1)

SERVht  CMP 2ht 2

(2)

log T IMEht  Nor mal 3ht 3

(3)

log AMN Tht  Nor mal 4ht 4

(4)

PROMht and SERVht (Equations (1) and (2)) are modeled as a COM-Poisson (Conway-MaxwellPoisson, CMP) process (Conway and Maxwell 1961).10
The COM-Poisson is a generalization of the Poisson
distribution with an extra parameter that governs
decay. The probability mass function of this distribu-
tion is as follows:

k -1 z

Pz

= k=0 k!

z=0 1 z!

(5)

It is a distribution with thicker or thinner tails than the Poisson (Boatwright et al. 2003, Shmueli et al. 2005). The Poisson, the Geometric, and the Bernoulli distributions are special cases of the COM-Poisson (with = 1 0, and , respectively). This distribution is defined over positive integers and is flexible in representing a variety of shapes. In particular, it is flexible in accounting for overdispersion as well as underdispersion in the data relative to the Poisson. Although neither the mean nor variance of this

distribution has convenient closed-form expressions,
modern computing overcomes this inconvenience,
allowing us to utilize the advantages this distribution
offers over simpler discrete distributions.
The parameter 1ht 2ht given 1 2 is proportional to the expected number of promotions re-
deemed (services bought) on each purchase occasion
by customer h (from the probability mass function
of the COM-Poisson distribution; see Shmueli et al.
2005), making it a measure of central tendency.
The interpurchase time (TIMEht) and the purchase amount (AMNTht) are modeled as log-normal processes (Equations (3) and (4)) with ( 3ht 3) and
4ht 4) as the corresponding parameters (mean and variance, respectively) of the distributions.
The effects of survey participation and various cus-
tomer and store-specific variables are introduced by specifying 1ht, 2ht, 3ht, and 4ht as follows:11

In the above equations, Iht is an indicator variable that takes on a value = 1 if customer h participated

in the satisfaction survey and the purchase occa-

sion t was postsurvey participation. In all other cases,

Iht takes on value = 0. The variable Tht indexes the purchase occasions (for customer h, purchase occa-

sion t) after the administration of the survey.12 The

variables HHm h, m = 1 M are the M customer characteristics and STn ht, n = 1 N are the N store-specific variables. In our application, we use six

customer characteristics and four store-specific vari-

ables that are expected to moderate the effects of sur-

vey participation on customers. These variables are

listed and defined in Table 2.

The customer characteristics and store-specific vari-

ables were chosen because they represent poten-

tially important--and from a managerial standpoint,

actionable--variables that could moderate the poten-

tial impact of survey participation on customers.

Thus, Equations (6) through (9) specify the impact

of customer characteristics and store-specific variables

and the time trend (denoted by Tht) on the four depen-

dent variables in two ways: First, parameters 1m, 2m,

3m, and 4m where m = 1

2n, 3n, and 4n where n = 1

4 specify the impact

of the six customer characteristics and the four store-

specific variables, respectively, on the overall behavior

(as specified by the four dependent measures) in the

absence of survey participation, i.e., for the control

group, and for the experimental group prior to sur-

vey participation. Similarly, the parameters 11, 21,

31, and 41 specify the impact of the time trend (Tht)

on the four dependent variables in the absence of sur-

vey participation.

specify the differential impact of these variables on

the overall behavior in the presence of survey par-

impact of a time trend and the customer- and store-

specific variables on the effect of participating in the

survey. The sum of these sets of parameters would

specify the overall impact of the corresponding vari-

ables on the four behaviors in the presence of survey

participation.13

The off-diagonal elements of the matrix specify the

structure of covariance across the four variables (i.e.,

bought, interpurchase time, and purchase amount).

Incorporating such a covariance structure allows for

dependencies across the four behaviors and is a more

efficient use of information in the data.

prior distributions on the parameters to be estimated. Appendix 1 lays out the prior distributions used in the analysis. The model is estimated using an MCMC sampling algorithm, details of which can be obtained from the authors on request. The result is a set of posterior distributions on each parameter to be estimated. These posterior distributions are summarized in the next section.
4. The Estimated Results
The posterior distributions obtained from the sampling scheme are summarized by their means and standard errors. The following section, along with Appendix 2,15 interprets and describes the estimated coefficients. The figures in parentheses (in various tables) are the posterior standard deviations. The convergence diagnostics were carried out using the Bayesian Output Analysis (BOA) program Version 0.5.0.
Before we present and discuss the impact of customer characteristics and store-specific variables on the effects of survey participation, we must point out that, as a validation check (for the existence of the survey participation effect), we also estimated a simpler version of Equations (6) through (9) with just the customer-specific intercepts, a single coefficient on Iht and Ih. In this simpler version, the estimated coefficient on Iht would be a measure of the average effect of survey participation. The signs of these coefficients ratify previous findings such as those of D&M and CMR regarding how survey participation potentially influences customer behaviors. In particular, at the aggregate level, participation in the customer satisfaction survey is associated with an increase in number of promotions redeemed (about 7.4% increase), an increase in number of services bought (a 3.5% increase), a decrease in interpurchase time (a decrease of 4.9%), and an increase in the dollar amounts spent on each occasion (increase of about 5.6%).16
Table 3 contains estimates for the parameters other than the customer characteristics, store, and time trend variables.
The parameters 1 and 2 are the "decay" parameters of the COM-Poisson distributions (the distribution of number of promotions redeemed and number of services bought, respectively, Equations (1) and (2)). A value of 1 for this parameter indicates a Poisson distribution, while values less than 1 indicate overdispersion and values greater than 1 indicate underdispersion relative to the Poisson.

and 2 are significantly different from 1, thus rejecting a Poisson model. Furthermore, 1 is greater than 1 and 2 is less than 1, indicating underdispersion in the distribution of number of promotions redeemed

and an overdispersion in the distribution of number

of services bought. This demonstrates the added flex-

ibility of the COM-Poisson whereby it can account for

both under- and overdispersion observed in the data.

It is pertinent to point out here that there are other

options to dealing with overdispersion in the data;

for example, the NBD distribution is a good candi-

date for modeling overdispersed data. However, the

COM-Poisson has the added flexibility to account for

underdispersion as well.

vices (a negative correlation with number of services

bias with respect to the number of services bought and the total amount spent across the two groups. However, the customer groups do differ in terms of number of promotions redeemed and the interpurchase times, and the parameters 1 and 3 control for this residual difference.
The finding regarding the positive effect of survey participation on coupon redemption is particularly noteworthy. These results demonstrate--for the first time, to our knowledge--that survey participation is not only associated with increased service purchase and use, as previous studies have found, but also potentially positively affects respondents' subsequent responsiveness to the firm's promotions.
4.1. Potential Impact of Customer Characteristics on Effects of Survey Participation17
The table of estimated coefficients and their detailed description is provided in Appendix 2. Table 4 contains a verbal description of the impact of customer characteristics on the four customer behaviors (number of promotions redeemed, number of services bought, interpurchase time, and purchase amounts). In the table, shaded boxes are areas where the survey had a significant impact on behavior.
17 Throughout the paper, for reasons to be discussed later (§5), we attribute significant correlations to a causal relationship. We thank the editor and the associate editor for suggesting this clarification.

Considering the customer's age, the results may be interpreted as suggesting a diminishing effect of survey participation with increasing age. Upon survey participation, younger customers tend to buy more services when compared to older customers (about 2% more services for every 10 years' age difference). With respect to tenure of the customer (as defined in Table 2), we find that the effect of customer tenure diminishes after survey participation. Previous research on the role of customer experience has found that greater customer experience with the firm at the time of survey participation tends to attenuate the survey participation effect (Morwitz et al. 1993). In our study, we used customer tenure with the firm as a measure of the customer's experience level and our results seem to agree with these previous findings in the sense that we find no differential impact of survey participation on three of the four customer behaviors (number of promotions redeemed, number of services bought, and interpurchase times). However, we do find a negative effect of tenure on the amounts spent on each purchase occasion.
The finding that the customer's age diminishes the impact of participating in the satisfaction survey can be explained by the fact that older customers are likely to be more experienced not only with purchasing automotive services, but also with respect to the firm, even before the survey. Such customers should

719

therefore be less likely to gain additional useful information from the survey, or to form measurementinduced judgments that are posited to underlie the survey participation effect (Fitzsimons and Williams 2000, Morwitz and Fitzsimons 2004, Dholakia et al. 2005). In contrast, younger customers will be the ones that are likely to have uncrystallized opinions regarding the firm. The survey should therefore be more impactful for them, leading to greater effects afterward.
Considering the age of the customer's vehicle, the results show that the newer the customer's vehicle, the greater the impact of survey participation on his or her subsequent behaviors. The tendency of customers with newer vehicles to buy fewer services is nullified on responding to the survey (Table 4). Furthermore, following survey participation, customers with newer vehicles tend to spend more money on each purchase occasion (on average, one year of "newness" roughly corresponds to an increase of about 0.4% spent on each occasion).
Along the lines of previous research (Fitzsimons and Williams 2000, Morwitz and Fitzsimons 2004, Dholakia et al. 2005), it can be argued that customers with newer vehicles are likely to care more about which service provider they use for their vehicle's maintenance and are therefore more likely to consider the survey to provide information regarding the firm's customer orientation. Such customers might also be relatively less experienced with the firm, having purchased the car relatively recently. As a result, they should be more affected by the survey, consistent with our finding.
We find that there is a minor increase in the interpurchase times for customers with newer vehicles in the presence of survey participation, but this effect is very small, and the net effect still is that newer vehicles tend to visit the store more often.
We find that customers with newer vehicles redeem fewer promotions, and this remains unchanged even after survey participation. One possibility for this could be that, conditional on the income and other factors, customers with newer vehicles might be relatively less price sensitive with respect to the services they purchase for their vehicle. Thus, they would be less likely to care about and hence redeem more promotions.
Considering the impact of customer's household income and household size, the results suggest that the difference in promotion sensitivities between higher-income and lower-income customers vanishes on survey participation and that the tendency of higher-income customers to visit the store less often gets significantly reduced (by almost 50%).18 Further-
18 For example, a 50% increase in income leads to an overall increase of 3.4% in the interpurchase times. However, in the presence of

more, we find that the tendency of larger households to spend less per visit diminishes postsurvey participation, indicating yet another positive effect of survey participation.
These results regarding the positive effects of household income and household size on the impacts of survey participation are more difficult to explain directly using the explanations of either measurement-induced judgments or informativeness of the survey itself. It could be that these demographic variables are positively associated with psychological variables such as thoughtfulness of information processing or persuasion knowledge of individual customers (e.g., Friestad and Wright 1994), which in turn lead to greater impact of survey participation. More research at the psychological level is needed to better understand why the influence of survey participation increases with household income and household size.
4.2. Potential Impact of Store-Specific Variables on Effects of Survey Participation
Table 5 contains a verbal description of the impact of store-specific variables on the four customer behaviors. (For details, please see Appendix 2.) As in Table 4, shaded boxes are areas where the survey had a significant impact on behavior.
A very interesting result in the analysis concerns the impact of store ownership (whether the store is company owned or franchisee owned19) on the survey participation effect. In the absence of survey participation, the company-owned stores seem to be underperformers relative to the franchisee-owned stores. In particular, customers tend to redeem fewer promotions as well as buy fewer services at such stores. On average, 8.2% fewer promotions are redeemed and 2.2% fewer services are bought in company-owned stores. However, these stores tend to benefit the most from the effects of survey participation on customers. The tendency of customers to redeem fewer promotions at company-owned stores is reversed in the presence of participation in the customer satisfaction survey; the company-owned stores now tend to get 7.5% more redemptions from these customers as compared to the franchisee-owned stores. The tendency of customers to buy fewer services at company-owned stores also is nullified following survey participation: Now there is no difference in the number of services bought in company-owned versus franchisee-owned stores. Additionally, the positive effects of survey participation to a company-owned store are manifested in the higher amounts being spent by respondents at
the survey participation effect, this increase gets lowered to a net 1.7% increase in interpurchase times.

the store following survey participation (about 2.7% greater spends on the part of the survey respondents in company-owned stores as opposed to franchiseeowned stores).
This finding, that survey participation has more beneficial effects on customers purchasing at company-owned stores of the firm than at franchiseeowned stores, which is robust across three of the four customer behaviors studied--promotion sensitivity, number of services purchased, and amount spent-- represents, to our knowledge, the first instance of a firm characteristic determining the strength of the survey participation effect on customers. Two possibilities could explain this difference. The first possibility arises from the fact that, on average, this firm's company-owned stores offer a larger menu of services to their customers than its franchisee-owned stores. As a result, it could be that following survey participation, customers visiting company-owned stores simply have more opportunities to act in accordance with their positive evaluations relative to those visiting franchisee-owned stores. Second, this firm also has a well-developed CRM system, and at the point of sale, service technicians (in both the company-owned and franchisee-owned stores) have access to customer details. It could be that, postsurvey, company-owned store employees are more responsive to their customers when compared to employees of franchiseeowned stores, leading to more positive behaviors from customers who visit the former stores. Further research is needed to examine which (or both) of these explanations, or other explanations, are responsible

for these differences. At any rate, this finding is significant for managers and is likely to raise the profile of customer satisfaction surveys among them.
4.3. Potential Impact of Time Trend on Effects of Survey Participation
Equations (6) through (9) also contain a time trend variable Tht, which is the index number of the purchase occasion (for customer h, purchase occasion t) in the period after participation in the survey. The corresponding coefficients delineate the impact of a time trend20 in the presence and absence of survey participation; Table 6 contains a verbal description of the impact (for details, please see Appendix 2).
In the absence of survey participation (i.e., in the time period following survey administration for the control group customers), we find that there is an increasing time trend for number of services bought (an increase of about 2.3% with each purchase occasion), a decreasing time trend for interpurchase times (a decrease of 1.2% in the interpurchase times with each purchase occasion). For the purchase amounts, too, there is an increasing time trend (an increase of 2.5% expenditure with each purchase occasion).21
20 Please note that we use a very general interpretation of the word trend. Our interpretation simply is that, given the time span of data postsurvey, how the survey effect across the four behaviors changed (linearly) across purchase occasions.
21 The estimated time trend for the number of promotions redeemed is also positive, a 1.2% increase. However, the parameter 11 is significant only at a 90% significance level.

In general, we would expect the survey participation effect to wear off with time (D&M). We have one year's observations postsurvey participation, so our time horizon to notice this wearing-off effect is one year. We find that in the presence of survey participation, one year is enough time for the impact to start wearing off on the number of services bought and the amount expended. The rate of increase in the number of services bought and the amount expended decreases from 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively, to less than 1%.
One year, however, does not seem to be enough time for the effects of survey participation on number of promotions redeemed and the interpurchase times to wear off. The rate of increase in the number of promotions redeemed with every purchase occasion remains at a similar level (to that in the absence of survey participation). However, the rate of decrease in interpurchase times further decreases from a decrease of 1.2% to a decrease of 3.3% in the presence of survey participation. We find that the impact of participating in the survey on the interpurchase times has a much-delayed effect relative to the impact on the other behaviors (number of promotions redeemed, number of services bought, and amount expended). This result is interesting and raises the possibility that survey participation could produce complex timevarying effects. We believe that this result provides opportunity for further research.22
5. General Discussion
5.1. Summary of Results Consistent with prior research (e.g., D&M, CMR) and our own assessment of the evidence, we attribute the correlation between survey participation and customer behavior to the impact of survey participation
22 We also explored fitting a quadratic trend variable and found it (the quadratic part of the trend variable) to have insignificant impact on three of the four behaviors (number of services bought, interpurchase time, and purchase amounts). However, there was a nonlinear impact on the number of promotions redeemed. This is being further investigated in a related but different work by the authors.

on customer behavior. Given such an attribution, in our study conducted with a U.S. automotive services firm we found substantial effects of survey participation on all customer behaviors examined, including number of coupons redeemed, number of services purchased, purchase frequency, and amount of money spent on each visit to the firm's stores. Building on the previous studies that had examined customer behaviors in the aggregate, we found the effects of survey participation to be moderated by customer characteristics as well as store-specific variables, and also to vary over time.
In particular, using a joint modeling methodology, we found that newness of the customer's vehicle, household income, and household size all generally increased the impact of participating in surveys on customer behavior. On the other hand, the customer's age and his or her tenure with the firm were generally found to reduce the impact of survey participation.
Considering the role of store-specific variables, we found survey participation to have more beneficial effects on customers purchasing at company-owned stores of the firm than at franchisee-owned stores. This finding was robust across three of the four customer behaviors studied with regard to promotion sensitivity, number of services purchased, and amount spent. To our knowledge, this is the first documented instance of a firm characteristic determining the strength of the survey participation effect on customers.
Finally, analyses of the effects of survey participation over time reveal that the increase in both number of services purchased and amount spent postsurvey starts wearing off within a year after the survey, but the increase in number of promotions redeemed and reduction in interpurchase times persists even a year afterward. These findings affirm the persistence of the impact of conducting a short survey that previous studies such as those of D&M have found.
5.2. Managerial Implications Although future research might verify our inferences about the direction of causality, our research has potentially significant substantive implications for commercial marketing research practice. Although

Borle, Dholakia, Singh, and Westbrook: The Impact of Survey Participation on Subsequent Customer Behavior

722

Marketing Science 26(5), pp. 711­726, © 2007 INFORMS

recent concerns have been raised over the growing resistance of consumers to participation in commercial survey research studies (e.g., Bearden et al. 1998, Shea and LeBourveau 2000), we find that, for the firmsponsored satisfaction survey in the present case, customers do not appear to be so negatively disposed, at least as reflected by their subsequent behaviors. In fact, we found that survey participants engaged in more of each form of behavior we studied, relative to their behavior prior to the satisfaction survey, and that of a control group of survey nonparticipants. At the aggregate level, the finding regarding the positive impact of satisfaction survey participation on promotion responsiveness is especially noteworthy. This result establishes a link between participation in a customer satisfaction survey and subsequent responsiveness of the customer to the firm's promotions.
Our analysis, which revealed the moderating role of customer characteristics and store-specific variables, provides a useful approach to marketing researchers to minimize the unintended consequences of conducting survey-based satisfaction research. In particular, researchers can first identify which variables accentuate the impact of satisfaction survey participation, then quantify the degree of this impact as in the present case, and finally use this information to develop appropriate sampling schemes in subsequent survey-based projects. Such a procedure is especially relevant for commercial marketing research applications where researchers usually have considerable leeway in choosing their sampling procedures, and have access to large customer databases from which to draw their samples (e.g., Almquist and Wyner 2001, Crosby and Johnson 2001).
Managers commissioning survey-based satisfaction studies are often interested in understanding the net financial impact of conducting the research (Dholakia et al. 2005). Studies such as those of D&M and CMR have implied that positive benefits can be significant. However, while findings such as these suggest that the conventional view of the marketing research function as a cost center needs to be rethought (at least for satisfaction surveys), the present research provides managers who are interested in valuing the financial impact of conducting satisfaction surveys guidance toward a more accurate way of doing so. In particular, by identifying the specific drivers that moderate the impact of satisfaction survey participation, a scoring procedure could easily be implemented to determine the expected impacts on each of the respondents, yielding a cumulative estimate that is more accurate.
5.3. Limitations One concern that has been raised by prior research examining influences of survey participation (e.g., Morwitz et al. 1993) is that such effects might be

explained, at least in part, by nonresponse bias because responders to the survey may be more involved and interested than are nonresponders, and therefore more prone to engage in product purchase and use subsequently. In the present survey, the response rate of customers (number of contacted people responding to the survey) was in the 90%­95% range. The number of customers actually chosen for the survey was not available; however, consultations with the market research vendor and experience with other such studies led us to believe that contact rates were between 60% and 70%, leading to a net response rate between 54% and 67%. Although this response rate is high compared to industry standards, our results should be interpreted cautiously. It could be that there is an oversampling of interested and involved customers simply because they chose to be contacted, and then they participated in the survey.
A second related concern is the issue of concluding causality, i.e., drawing the conclusion that survey participation causes changes in customer behaviors, in mere measurement research. (See Shugan 2006 for a detailed discussion regarding this issue.) In the present study as well as in prior research we have cited, such as the D&M and the CMR studies, causality cannot be definitively established because there is at least some degree of selection bias in the respondent sample. In particular, customers who were accessible and agreed to be surveyed were compared against a control group of nonparticipants. A stronger test to establish causality requires an experimental design in which the firm creates two random lists of customers. One list is then assigned to the marketing research vendor which then conducts the survey using the list. The second list of customers serves as the control list. The appropriate test of the mere measurement effect is to compare the behaviors of all the customers from the two lists with each other. Future research should execute such a test to unequivocally show existence of the mere measurement effect.23

A1.1. Prior Specifications

Table A1.1 provides the priors used in the estimation.

Parameters 1, 2, 3, and 4 specify the scale parameters of the two COM-Poisson distributions and two log-normal

distributions, respectively (Equations (1) through (4)). Other

than the information that scale parameters are defined over

the positive real line, we do not have any a priori informa-

tion on the likely magnitudes. A prior of inverse gamma

(2.5, 0.5) is consistent with these prior beliefs.

Similarly, all the parameters that specify the impact of a

Equations

(6) through (9)), impact of customer characteristics (various

s and /s, Equations (6) through (9)) and impact of store-

specific variables (various s and /s, Equations (6) through

(9)) on the four dependent variables are given a prior of

Normal 0 100 . The reason is that we do not have any

sharp prior beliefs on either the magnitude or the signs of

these effects, and a Normal 0 100 is a reasonable repre-

sentation of these prior beliefs.

Parameters 1, 2, 3, 4 in Equations (6) through (9) are the coefficients on the dummy variable Ih, which in turn is introduced as an attempt to control for any residual selec-

tion bias. We expect the magnitudes for these coefficients to

be relatively closer to zero since a random procedure was

used by the firm to select respondents. However, we still

use a relatively diffuse prior (a Normal 0 100 ) for these

parameters.

Appendix 2. The Set of Estimated Coefficients

A2.1. Potential Impact of Customer Characteristics on Effects of Survey Participation
Table A2.1 contains estimates of parameters (of our full model) reflecting the impact of customer characteristics on the four customer behaviors (number of promotions redeemed, number of services bought, interpurchase time, and purchase amounts). The two sets of parameters (one set

with no superscripts in panel A and the other set with a

"" superscript in panel B) delineate this impact in terms of

an impact in the absence of and in the presence of survey

participation, respectively.24

The customer's gender is a significant variable in the

overall context; however, gender does not have a differ-

ential impact in presence of survey participation (the dif-

ferences

statistically insignificant). With respect to overall behavior,

women (binary code = 0) redeem more promotions (about

9.7% more promotions) as well as buy more services on

each purchase occasion (5.1% more services) (parameters

11 and 21, respectively) when compared to men. However, men visit the store more often than women (men's fre-

quency of visits is about 12% more than women) (parameter

31).25 Furthermore, gender does not seem to be associated with differences in the impact of survey participation on

subsequent customer behaviors, because both genders have

similar coefficients in both presence and absence of survey

participation.

As with gender, the age of the customer has a signifi-

cant overall impact on behavior. On the whole, older cus-

tomers tend to redeem more promotions, visit the store less

frequently, and tend to spend less on each visit (param-

eters 13, 33, and 43, respectively). Upon survey participation, there is no change in the increased promotion

sensitivity and decreased expenditure on the part of older

customers

(

respectively).

However,

customers tend to buy more services than older customers

frequency of visits disappears after survey participation (

 33

vs. 33 .

Regarding the role of customer experience (operational-

ized as the TENURE variable in our study) the results

largely agree with previous findings in the sense that we

find no differences pre- and postsurvey participation on

three of the four customer behaviors (number of promo-

tions redeemed, number of services bought, and interpur-

chase times). However, we do find a negative impact of

tenure postsurvey participation with respect to the pur-

chase amount spent on each service visit. In our data, we

observe that long-standing customers spend more ( 46) in the absence of survey participation, although the magni-

tude of this effect is small (every extra encounter with the

firm results in 0.2% more expenditure by the customer).

However, postsurvey participation, this tendency of long-

standing customers to spend more is attenuated, and dis-

appears (the net result is a null effect,

 46

.

24 With reference to Equation (6) through (9), for example,

 12

=

12 +

/ 12

,

and

so

forth.

25 It is pertinent to mention that the men/women comparison

already accounts for the correlation across various behaviors (as

specified by the variance covariance matrix). Thus it is a finer com-

parison than one without accounting for the correlation, which

might be suspect in that it would pick up the natural covariance

between these behaviors.

Considering the age of the customer's vehicle, the results

show that customers with newer vehicles redeem fewer pro-

motions (are less promotion sensitive) and buy fewer ser-

vices (parameters 12 and 22, respectively). However, they tend to visit the store more often ( 32). The impact of vehicle vintage in the presence of survey participation is inter-

esting: The tendency of customers with newer vehicles to

buy fewer services gets nullified postsurvey participation

(parameter

 22

.

Furthermore,

postsurvey

participation,

cus-

tomers with newer vehicles spend more money on each

purchase occasion (on average, one year of "newness" leads

to an increase of about 0.4% spent on each occasion). Con-

versely there is also a minor increase in the interpurchase

times for customers with newer vehicles in the presence of

survey participation (the difference is

 32

-

32 . However,

the net effect still is that newer vehicles tend to visit the

store more often (there is no sign reversal of the parameter).

Overall, customers with higher income buy more services

and spend more on each purchase occasion (parameters 24 and 44, respectively). They also tend to visit the store less often ( 34). However, these higher-income customers tend to be more promotion sensitive ( 14 is positive and significant). Postparticipation in the survey, this tendency of

higher-income customers to be promotion sensitive is atten-

uated

(

 14

),

i.e.,

survey

participation

potentially

tends

to

make higher-income customers less sensitive (as compared

to the lower-income customers) to promotions. From the

firm's perspective, the good news is that the tendency of

higher-income customers to visit the store less often gets

significantly diminished postparticipation in a satisfaction

survey (

 34

vs.

34 .

Finally, we find that an increase in the customer's house-

hold size is associated with a diminishing amount expended

by the customer per visit ( 45 . In the absence of survey participation, customers with larger households spend less per

visit. However, this effect gets attenuated postparticipation

in the survey (

indi-

cating yet another positive effect of survey participation.

The TPUTht variable is a measure of the total throughput time per service at the store. A greater value for this variable

indicates a greater time taken for services at a particular

store (in comparison to other stores of the firm). In gen-

eral, we find that fewer promotions are redeemed and visits

are made less frequently at stores with higher throughput

times ( 11 and 31, respectively). On the other hand, higher amounts are spent per service visit at these stores ( 41 . It is important to note that a higher average throughput time

could be either an indicator of inefficiency by a particu-

lar store, or a reflection of the fact that the store provides

more time-consuming services.26 Because is likely that time-

consuming services cost more, our results point to this latter

explanation: that there are particular stores that customers

typically visit for their bigger maintenance needs.27 It would

be very interesting and informative for the firm to uncover

such a cluster of stores. In postsurvey participation, there

is no differential impact of the store throughput time on

the four customer behaviors when compared to those cases

where customers did not participate in the survey (param-

eters 11 through 41 are not significantly different from

parameters

 11

through

 41

.

There is a positive relationship between the number of

service bays at the store and the number of promotions

redeemed (an additional bay corresponds to approximately

3.6% more promotions being redeemed at the store). How-

ever, this effect is not significantly influenced by survey par-

ticipation. Other than this one overall impact, the number

of bays in the store does not have a significant impact on

the other three customer behaviors. Bigger stores are likely

to have more bays and also generate more revenues; how-

ever, the revenue that we are measuring in this study is the

revenue per customer per visit, and we find that this vari-

able is not affected by the number of bays that a store has.

It is possible that such bigger stores offer more services and

subsequently have more promotion redemptions.

The presence of a customer lounge in the store has a pos-

itive relation to the number of promotions being redeemed

by customers at the store ( 13 (possibly, larger stores offering more services are more likely to have a lounge, therefore

customers are more likely to redeem more promotions at

such stores). However, this effect gets nullified in postsur-

vey

participation

(

 13

. In particular, following survey par-

ticipation, the presence or absence of a lounge in the store

has no impact on the number of promotions redeemed by

the customers.

Considering the impact of store ownership (whether the

store is company owned or franchisee owned),28 we find

that customers redeem fewer promotions as well as buy

fewer services at the company-owned stores ( 14 and 24, respectively). On average, 8.2% fewer promotions are
redeemed and 2.2% fewer services are bought in company-

owned stores. However, postparticipation in the customer

26 The data contain no further information to segregate these effects.
27 If the predominant reason for the increases in throughput was inefficiency, then it seems unlikely that customers would tend to spend more per visit in these inefficient stores.
28 OWNERSHIPht = 1 implies company owned and = 0 implies franchisee owned.

A2.3. Potential Impact of Time Trend on Effects of

Survey Participation

Table A2.3 contains the set of coefficients on the variable Tht (Equations (6) through (9)).

In the absence of survey participation (i.e., in the time

period following survey administration for the control

group customers) there is an increasing time trend for num-

ber of services bought (an increase of about 2.3% with each

purchase occasion, parameter 21), and a decreasing time trend for interpurchase times (a decrease of 1.2% in the

interpurchase times with each purchase occasion, calculated

from 31). For the purchase amounts, too, there is an increasing time trend, showing an increase of 2.5% expenditure

with each subsequent purchase occasion (parameter 41).29 We have one year's observation postsurvey participation,

so our time horizon to notice any time effects is one year.

The differences

21 -

 21

and

41 -

 41

are both positive

and significant, indicating that one year is enough time for

the impact to start wearing off on the number of services

bought and the amount expended. However, the difference

11 -

 11

is statistically insignificant, while the difference

31 -

 31

is actually positive, indicating that one year does

not seem to be enough time for the effects of survey partic-

ipation on number of promotions redeemed and the inter-

purchase times to wear off.
