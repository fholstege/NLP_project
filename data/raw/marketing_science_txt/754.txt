Prior behavioral research has suggested that advertising can influence a consumer's quality evaluation through informative and transformative effects. The informative effect acts directly to inform a consumer of product attributes and hence shapes her evaluations of brand quality. The transformative effect affects the consumer's evaluation of brand quality by enhancing her assessment of her subsequent consumption experience. In addition, advertising may influence a consumer's utility directly, even without providing any explicit information--this is the persuasive effect.
In this paper, we propose a framework that formally models the processes through which all three effects of advertisements impact consumers' brand evaluations and their subsequent brand choice decisions. In particular, we model source credibility, confirmatory bias, and bounded rationality on the part of consumers, by appropriately modifying the standard Bayesian learning approach. Our model conforms closely to prior behavioral literature and the experimental findings therein. In our empirical analysis, we get significant estimates of both informative and transformative effects across brands. We find interesting temporal patterns across the effects; for instance, the importance of transformative effects seem to grow over time, while that of informative effects diminishes. Finally, we conduct policy experiments to examine the impact of increased ad intensity on advertising effects, as well as the role played by consumption ambiguity.
Key words: advertising effects; informative effects; persuasive effects; structural models; consumer learning; policy experiments; bounded rationality; confirmatory bias

1. Introduction
Advertising, it has been conjectured in prior literature, shapes consumer preferences in multiple ways. The first, most obvious effect is that advertising informs the consumer of product attributes and hence raises awareness and knowledge of the true quality of the brand. This has been called the informative effect of advertising (Bucklin 1965, Lavidge and Steiner 1961). Second, advertising may directly influence a consumer's brand evaluations through such cues as celebrity endorsements and music, even without providing any explicit information. This has been referred to as the persuasive or prestige effect of ads (Aaker and Stayman 1990, Batra and Ray 1986). Third, advertising can influence how consumers experience and evaluate the quality of the

product from subsequent consumption. This effect has been evocatively referred to as the transformative effect of advertising (Deighton 1984, 1988) and is the focus of our paper. It is important at the outset to differentiate the transformative effect from the informative and persuasive effects. One key feature helps us do that--transformative effects have an impact only in the presence of consumption. If the consumer watches the ad and does not consume thereafter, there can be, by definition, no transformative effect. By contrast, both informative and persuasive effects exist independently of subsequent consumption. Thus, unlike the informative or persuasive effects, the transformative effect does not change consumers' brand evaluations immediately after they are exposed to the advertisements, but instead shapes consumers' evaluations

by influencing what they learn about the brand's quality/attributes from their subsequent consumption experience. Prior research suggests that these effects are not mutually exclusive, i.e., an advertisement can have informative, persuasive, and transformative effects. Our goal in this paper is to develop a model that accommodates all three effects, while hewing closely to behavioral and economic theories of advertising, and to estimate this model using real-world data.
A number of papers have suggested diverse theoretical rationale for the informative effects of advertising (e.g., hierarchy-of-effects models, such as Lavidge and Steiner 1961 or Aaker et al. 1992; alternative frameworks are provided by Greenwald 1968 and Fishbein and Ajzen 1975). This literature suggests that the effect is strongest when involvement is high and when advertisements provide information about brand attributes that are relevant and verifiable, leading to greater confidence on the part of the consumer in her assessments of the brand's quality (Nelson 1970, 1974; Holbrook 1978).
Regarding the persuasive effect, a stream of literature based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty et al. 1983) suggests that under low involvement situations, the peripheral route to persuasion dominates, and consumers pay attention to the execution elements of the ad more than to any information provided. The key is that consumers' brand evaluations are enhanced even without the cognitive evaluation of attributes (Aaker and Norris 1982, Zajonc and Markus 1980).1 Before we move on to the transformative effect, for the sake of completeness, we should mention the "signaling" role of advertising that has been modeled theoretically (Kihlstrom and Riordan 1984, Milgrom and Roberts 1986), and estimated econometrically (Ackerberg 2003, Erdem et al. 2006). These papers suggest that the quantity of advertising can itself signal quality--the consumer interprets higher advertising intensity as a signal of higher quality.2
A relatively smaller literature has examined the transformative role of advertising. A major strand of this work draws on behavioral literature to suggest that message and subsequent consumption experience interact (Slovic et al. 1977, Gilovich 1981). Hoch and Deighton (1989) suggest the following process of transformation. Consumers perceive ads to be biased, because they realize that ads are coming from a partisan source whose interests are not necessarily aligned
1 Econometrically, the persuasive effect has been modeled through a term directly affecting the utility. As we discuss later, this is best understood, conceptually, using the Becker-Murphy (1993) notion of advertising as a complementary good.
2 While we mention the signaling effect here for completeness, we do not model it in the paper.

with their own. However, because they do not know the exact amount of this bias, consumers treat the ad as a tentative hypothesis, which they test during subsequent consumption. If the advertising message connects tightly with the consumption experience, i.e., in some sense, the ad tells consumers which attributes to look out for during subsequent consumption, it leads to a confirmatory bias in learning from the consumption experience. In other words, learning from consumption serves to confirm the expectations created by the ad, and biases in the ad message get manifested in learning from consumption. Because the behavioral underpinnings and econometric estimation of the transformative effect are a cornerstone of this paper, it helps to elaborate on the process just outlined.
The transformative effect. To start with, why would ads result in consumers forming a tentative hypothesis about the quality of the brand? This is because even though consumers perceive the ads to be biased, they are not aware of the extent of the bias, and they do not reject the message altogether. The ad facilitates this process when it encourages a "willing suspension of disbelief" (the attributes are presented in a suggestive rather than didactic fashion). Clearly, on this point alone, ads can influence subsequent consumption experiences. However, crucially, the impact is a great deal more than this--prior literature suggests that consumers are predisposed to confirming the hypotheses suggested by the ad, while verifying its claims during consumption.
Why does this happen? Researchers suggest this is because of consumers' information processing limitations. During consumption, consumers get evidence that is both consistent and inconsistent with the adbased expectations. If consumption occurs during low involvement conditions, consumers learn through top-down learning, or passive observation, where they pay more attention to ad-consistent evidence and less to ad inconsistent evidence (Hoch and Deighton 1989, Snyder and Swann 1978). Thus, what consumers learn about the brand's quality/attributes through consumption is consistent with the expectations laid out by the ads. This would happen if there is a match between the attributes suggested by the ad and the attributes observed during consumption. In sum, the biases in the ad get transferred to the information the consumer learns about the product from subsequent consumption.
The above description of the transformative effect still leaves two important questions unanswered. First, what determines the strength of the transformative effect? Apart from the content of the ad itself (appropriately suggestive of the attributes and the best way to evaluate them during the subsequent consumption experience), and consumer involvement

(lower is better because it encourages learning by passive observation), an important determinant is the ambiguity of the consumption experience. Hoch and Ha (1986) found that top-down processing of information (thus enhancing the transformative effect) was the norm when the consumption experience was ambiguous. Clearly, if consumption provides unambiguous evidence, it also allows any ad claims that are potentially biased to be easily refuted, and the information learned from consumption dominates consumers' brand evaluations. On the other hand, if the consumption experience is noisy, then consumers could interpret the consumption experience as being consistent with their ad-based expectations.
Second, are consumers aware that their evaluations from consumption are being influenced by their adbased expectations in this fashion? If they are aware of this influence, they will discount it, hence negating the transformative effect. Prior literature suggests that this is unlikely to happen, because consumers privilege their product experiences, i.e., they grant a special status to conclusions learned from experience and suffer from an illusion of control (Langer 1975). As such, they do not doubt the credibility of what they learn from consumption (Hoch and Ha 1986, Hoch and Deighton 1989).
Modeling challenges. The modeling of all three effects of advertising carries with it a number of challenges. Prior literature has used the Bayesian learning paradigm to model informative and persuasive effects structurally (Erdem and Keane 1996, Ackerberg 2003). We argue that the standard Bayesian learning model has to be modified along multiple dimensions to model transformative effects for the following reasons.
(a) Source credibility. Standard Bayesian learning models assume that each ad is an independent and unbiased signal of the brand's true quality, or even if the signal is biased, the consumer knows the extent of the bias exactly. In practice, consumers are aware that advertising messages are motivated by a desire to influence, and are generally wary of the credibility of the source. This suggests that consumers know advertising messages are biased, but do not know the exact extent of this bias. The first challenge is to build an appropriate model of how consumers form expectations of the brand's quality from ads, which accommodates this feature.
(b) Confirmatory bias. In a standard Bayesian learning model, (prior) ad signals and (post) consumption signals are assumed to be independent pieces of information. That is, ad signals have no impact on how subsequent consumption is evaluated. The idea behind confirmatory bias, however, is that ad-based expectations influence what the consumer sees during

subsequent consumption. As discussed earlier, advertising provides a frame for consumers to evaluate consumption experiences within. This leads to precisely the kind of nonindependence suggested by Fischoff and Beyth-Marom (1983) and Hoch and Deighton (1989), i.e., one piece of data (ad signals) creates a context that affects the interpretation of a new piece of data (the consumption experience). A modified Bayesian learning model has to account for the correlation between ad expectations about the brand's quality, and the information that the consumer learns about the brand's quality from subsequent consumption evaluations.
(c) Consumer bounded rationality. The confirmatory bias just discussed clearly suggests that consumers are not unboundedly rational. This sits uneasily with the tenets of the standard Bayesian learning model, where consumers get independent ad and consumption signals, and update their quality beliefs each period on the basis of both these signals in a rational Bayesian fashion. Carried to its logical extreme, consumers would be aware of the confirmatory bias induced by ads and would accordingly discount information learned from consumption in a rational Bayesian fashion. Clearly, one cannot have transformation in this scenario. As argued above, consumers do not seem to take into account the transference of biases from ad-based expectations to consumption, while evaluating consumption experiences. It seems appropriate, therefore, to allow consumers to not discount what they learn from consumption experiences, even if that learning is biased by prior ads.3
All this suggests two ways to proceed. One can either abandon the Bayesian learning framework (with no clear alternative in sight) or modify it to accommodate the deviations mentioned above. We choose the latter approach, because it lets us retain a relatively parsimonious framework that has proved useful in earlier work, while also providing a ready benchmark for comparison purposes. A formal treatment of how we modify the Bayesian learning model is deferred to §2, where we discuss model development.
In the rest of the introduction, we list our research objectives and discuss briefly how we accomplish them. In so doing, we also present a gist of our main findings. This is followed by a brief review of the relevant literature.
3 Bounded rationality enters our model only as it relates to the impact of ads, i.e., consumers are unaware that their consumption evaluations are being transformed by ads. Further discussion of other aspects of bounded rationality is provided in the conclusions section.

1.1. Research Objectives and Contributions (a) To propose a formal framework that explicitly mod-
els the process though which the informative and transformative effects of advertisements impact consumers' brand evaluations and their subsequent brand choice decisions:4 We view the modeling of source credibility, confirmatory bias, and bounded rationality as a major contribution of the paper. These three components are at the heart of our structural model of advertising's impact on brand choice, and we accommodate them so as to hew closely to behavioral theories of advertising.
(b) To calibrate our model on observed data: We calibrate our proposed model on single-source data for liquid laundry detergents. In our empirical analysis, we find significant, albeit modest, informative and transformative effects of advertisements across brands. Among our results, we find that the parameter capturing the extent to which consumers suspect the credibility of ads as a source of information is significant and varies across brands. Similarly, the confirmatory bias (the extent of transference of biases from ads to subsequent consumption experiences) is significant and varies across brands.
(c) To conduct policy experiments to assess the impact of changing advertising effects: We conduct a number of policy experiments to tease out the pattern of variation in the effects of advertising across brands. For instance, we examine what the temporal patterns of informative, transformative, and persuasive effects are, i.e.--are some effects more powerful at the beginning of the learning period versus later? We also look at the impact of informative and transformative effects on the clout and vulnerability of brands. Thus we conjecture that increasing informative effects primarily serves to increase the brand's competitive clout but does not substantially change its vulnerability, while increasing transformative effects primarily serves to decrease the brand's vulnerability but does not significantly impact its competitive clout. We find evidence supporting this conjecture. We also investigate the impact of changes in ad intensity on market share, again intertemporally for all three effects.
1.2. Related Empirical Literature While the literature on the effects of advertising is vast, there are two main streams that are of relevance to this study. Both of these examine the effects of advertising in a field setting, typically using econometric methods on scanner panel data for frequently purchased consumer goods. The first set of studies includes, among many others, Pedrick and Zufryden
4 As mentioned earlier, while we do model persuasive effects, this is done in a fairly simple fashion, consistent with prior literature. We include persuasive effects for the sake of completeness and do not view their modeling as an important contribution of this paper.

(1991) and Lodish et al. (1995) for testing informative effects, and Tellis (1988) and Deighton et al. (1994) for testing transformative effects. These studies have employed reduced-form specifications to capture the effects of advertising on consumer evaluations--they generally find weak informative effects and nonsignificant transformative effects. We suggest that they find nonsignificant results because they do not model the process by which consumers' brand evaluations are shaped by the different effects of advertising. Modeling the process helps avoid errors that could result in biasing the effects.
Another set of papers consists of structural approaches to testing the impact of advertising (Ching 2003, Erdem and Keane 1996, Erdem et al. 2006, Mukherji et al. 2004, Narayanan et al. 2005) invariably using a quality learning specification. Erdem and Keane (1996) is a pioneering effort that models the informative effect of ads in the laundry detergent category, accounting for forward-looking risk-averse consumers. Consumers are modeled as learning about quality through advertising and consumption signals in a standard Bayesian learning setting. Ackerberg (2003) and Narayanan et al. (2005) build on this work--the former models persuasive and signaling effects in the yogurt category, while the latter models informative and persuasive effects in pharmaceutical drugs. Both these papers model persuasive effects as directly influencing the utility of the consumer (e.g., ads enhancing the prestige associated with the brand). This direct term affecting a consumer's utility essentially captures all the effects of advertising that are not otherwise modeled structurally. The way the persuasive effect has been modeled econometrically is perhaps best understood by conceptualizing it a la Becker and Murphy (1993). In their story, advertising can be viewed as a complement to the product desired, which makes it natural to include advertising "consumed" directly in the utility the product provides. While calling this a "persuasive" effect does not map on exactly to the behavioral literature on the subject, it is a more satisfactory way to explain why one needs a term directly affecting the utility of the consumer. Finally, Erdem et al. (2006) also consider the informative, signaling, and persuasive effect of ads, but adds a role for price as a signal of quality.
None of the above papers explicitly allows ads to influence the evaluation of consumption experiences in a manner consistent with the notion of transformation. In addition, none of them accounts for features such as source credibility or confirmatory bias, both of which are the impetus behind our modification of the standard Bayesian learning framework.
Mukherji et al. (2004) is the only paper that has attempted to explicitly model the interaction of consumption with marketing communication. However,

Mehta, Chen, and Narasimhan: Disentangling the Multiple Effects of Advertising on Brand Choice Decisions

338

their specification has no role for transformation as is conceptualized in the literature. In the model of Mukherji et al. (2004), the ads are assumed to be unbiased signals of the brand's true quality (thereby assuming that ads are a credible source of information), and the only interaction that is allowed between ads and consumption is one that makes for faster learning about the brand's true quality from consumption if the consumer has watched ads before (thereby implying that there is no confirmatory bias).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, we discuss our model specification, followed by a discussion of the data, estimation methodology, and estimation results in §3. We also report the results of a number of policy experiments in §3. Section 4 concludes with limitations and suggestions for future research.
2. Model Development
2.1. Model Overview The basic premise of our model is that consumers are uncertain about product quality, and hence attempt to learn about it. There are two sources that can shape a consumer's evaluations: advertising and consumption. In our model, the consumer's information from advertising constitutes an advertising set, while her information from consumption experiences constitutes a consumption set. She updates each of these sets as she gets more information from an advertising message or from her consumption experience. Therefore, the informative effect of ads, which is the immediate impact of ads on quality learning, comes through the advertising set; while the information learned from consumption and, consequently, the transformative effect of ads, comes through the consumption set. On each purchase occasion, the consumer mixes evaluations from the two sets to come up with her overall quality evaluation for each brand. At this point, it is useful to highlight the following fact. Of the three advertising effects that we wish to model, only the informative and transformative effects impact consumer learning. The persuasive effect enters the utility function directly and does not affect learning about quality. The discussion that follows focuses exclusively on how consumers learn about true quality and, consequently, ignores the persuasive effect. We incorporate the persuasive effect when we obtain the final utility expression for the consumer.
2.2. Utility Specification and Evolution of Consumer's Overall Quality Evaluations
On each purchase occasion, a consumer forms quality evaluations of each brand on offer and, based on these evaluations, picks a brand to purchase. Consider a product category with j = 1 to J brands. We

assume that the consumer's expected indirect utility from brand j on purchase occasion t can be approximated as a function of brand j's overall quality evaluation, qj t, price, pj t, and feature and display variables. Because prior literature has found significant risk aversion in many categories (Erdem and Keane 1996) and highlighted the possible misspecification arising from ignoring this term (Byzalov and Shachar 2004), we incorporate risk aversion through a mean-variance specification. The indirect utility is given as:5

EtUj t = Et qj t + r Et qj t - Et qj t 2 - ppj t + f F eatj t + dDispj t + per j Perj t + j t (1)

The parameter denotes the consumer's intensity of
preference for quality, r represents her degree of risk
aversion, p represents her price sensitivity, f represents the impact of features, d represents the impact of display, per j represents the brand-specific persuasive effect of advertising, and j t represents a type 1 extreme-valued random variable that is independent
across all consumers, brands, and purchase occasions.
Featj t and Dispj t represent the presence or absence of features and displays, respectively, for brand j at
time t. Perj t is defined as the number of ads seen by a consumer between t - 1 and t, divided by the number
of minutes of television watched during that period
(Ackerberg 2003). This term captures the persuasive
effect of ads. The rationale of including it directly in
the utility function follows Becker and Murphy (1993),
in that the intensity of advertising is a product char-
acteristic like calories or taste that provides utility to
consumers. The specification here suggests that con-
sumers receive more utility from consuming a prod-
uct with higher ad intensities.
We assume the true quality of brand j to be qj . The consumer does not have enough information to esti-
mate precisely the true quality of any brand in the product category.6

about brand j's quality at purchase occasion t.

5 For notational convenience, we have suppressed the subscript for the consumer.
6 An alternative formulation would be in terms of product attributes and uncertainty surrounding the mean levels of these attributes. To the extent that one considers only one attribute, as in Erdem and Keane (1996), the two approaches are identical (see also Mehta et al. 2003).

Formally, we assume that the consumer constructs

her overall evaluations of the quality of any brand j

at occasion t, qj t, by mixing her quality evaluations from two information sets, the advertising set

Aj t and the consumption set Cj t. The division of the consumer's information set into two parts facilitates

the exposition of the informative and transformative

effects; the advertising set contains information that

the consumer learns from the informative effects of

ads, and the consumption set contains information

that the consumer learns from consumption experi-

ences and the transformative effects of ads.

Defining the advertising set. The advertising set, Aj t, contains the cumulative information that the con-

sumer has learned about brand j's quality from its

advertisements prior to occasion t. We represent the

evaluations based on the advertising set Aj t as qja t

the precision of the information conveyed by an adver-

lar to Erdem and Keane (1996), we assume the eval-

uations based on the advertising set at occasion t to

be formed from all advertisements seen prior to occa-

sion t.7 Note that the advertising set contains informa-

tion learned from the informative effect of ads.

Defining the consumption set. The consumption set,

Cj t, contains cumulative information about the consumer's assessment of brand j's true quality from her

consumption experiences prior to occasion t. These

consumption experiences can be pure (i.e., no impact

of advertising) or transformed (shaped by advertis-

ing), depending on whether the consumer has not

seen advertisements for the brand prior to purchase

or has seen them, respectively. Regardless, we repre-

sent the consumer's evaluations of brand j's quality

overall quality beliefs to make her purchase decision at occasion t. Note from Equation (3) that the evolution of quality beliefs, qj t, depends on the evolution of beliefs based on her advertising set, qja t, and the evolution of beliefs based on her consumption set, qjc t. We now discuss how each of these component beliefs evolves, while emphasizing the changes made to the standard Bayesian learning model necessitated by a consideration of source credibility, confirmatory bias, and bounded rationality.

2.2.1. Evolution of Consumer's Quality Evalua-

tions Based on Her Advertising Set: Accounting for

Source Credibility. Consider the case where the con-

sumer receives Nj t (where Nj t is the sum of advertisements received between all purchase occasions,

i.e., Nj t =

t s=0

nj

s)

advertising

exposures

of

brand

j

between occasions 0 and t. Let ij r be the rth (where

r  1 Nj t) advertising signal for brand j received

by the consumer between purchase occasions t - 1

and t. In the standard Bayesian learning model, we

would assume that the signals ij r are distributed around the true quality qj , and are independent across all brands and all consumers. Neither of these holds

once we consider source credibility issues. As discussed

earlier, we now have to account for the fact that

advertisers are not viewed as nonpartisan communi-

cators.

We can accommodate source credibility by incor-

porating the idea that the advertising signal attempts

to convey a quality that differs from the true qual-

ity by some amount, which represents the "bias" in

the signal. Formally, we can write the rth ad signal of

brand j as follows:

ij r = qj + bj + j ij r

(4)

where qj is the true quality of brand j, bj is the true bias in the ad, j is the inverse of the level of precision in the ad message about the quality it is trying to por-

tray, and ij r is a random error that is independently and identically distributed (IID) across all r and t.

Now, if the consumer knows the extent of the bias

exactly, she can discount it to obtain an unbiased ad

signal, centered on the true quality qj . It is not very reasonable to believe that the consumer knows the

amount of bias exactly (but, for instance, does not

know the quality of the product). We therefore con-

sider the more realistic (and interesting) case where

the consumer has beliefs about the bias, denoted as

N b¯j

,

where

b¯ j

is

her

belief

of

the

and

mean.8

Note that her belief of the mean bias could well be

8 Note that the consumer assumes a constant bias in advertisements. The implication of this is that the consumer does not let what she learns from consumption in the current period influence

greater than the "actual" bias in the ads--this would capture the situation where the consumer thinks that the source is less credible than it actually is. The uncertainty, in turn, could be high for a number of reasons--perhaps most obviously, because the brand is new and the consumer does not know much about the source yet. Given these beliefs, the consumer discounts the ad signal by the mean bias, and gets the adjusted ad signal

(5)

It is important to note that the consumer's ad-based
expectations are based on this discounted ad signal. However, she does not know the value of (bj - b¯j ). Thus, from her perspective, (bj - b¯j ) will be a random variable, bj bj , whose value remains the same across all ads. This implies that the discounted ad signal
from the consumer's perspective would be given by

adj jr

(6)

The discounted ad signal leads to two differences

from the standard Bayesian learning model. First,

observe that because the consumer discounts each ad by a constant amount b¯j , the random error bj bj is the same for all ads of a brand j. This suggests that ad

signals of brand j get serially correlated.9 Note that

this correlation arises endogenously because of the

assumption that advertisers suffer from source credi-

bility issues, and the consequent discounting. Second,

the variance of the discounted ad signal is larger than

in the standard Bayesian learning case;

The correlation between ad signals engendered by

the presence of source credibility, in turn, suggests

that the informativeness of N ad signals is no longer

N times the informativeness of a single signal. If

her beliefs about ad bias in the next period. One could think of a more complicated situation where the consumer constantly updates her beliefs on the bias, based on what she learns about the product. This would set up a feedback loop from consumption to advertising that is absent from the current model. While making for a more satisfactory description, it would likely render the model intractable.
9 The result that source credibility leads to serial correlation between the ad signals accords well with the findings of Hoch and Deighton (1989, p. 7), who state that "in learning through education, they [consumers] are alert to source credibility and are sensitive to the fact that repeated ads from a manufacturer are not independent."

How much extra do Nj t ads convey, versus one ad? To answer this, note that the informativeness of

one ad signal is just 1/

2 j

+

2 bj

,

while

the

informa-

tional value of Nj t ads can be obtained from Equa-

tion (7) above as 1/

2j /Nj t +

2 bj

.

Therefore,

the

ratio

of the informational value of Nj t ads to the informa-

tional value of one ad is

2 jt

=

2 j

+

2 bj

/

2j /Nj t +

2 bj

,

or simply

2 jt

=

Nj

t

sj2 + 1 / Nj tsj2 + 1

, where sj2 =

2 bj

/

2 j

is

the

ratio

of

the

uncertainty

in

the

consumer 's

beliefs of the bias in the ads of brand j relative to

the noise in the advertising signal of brand j. Notice

that

2 jt

is

less

than

Nj t,

the

ratio

for

the

standard

Bayesian learning model. Also note that as the uncer-

tainty around the bias increases, the ratio declines;

for zero uncertainty, the ratio becomes Nj t, exactly as in the standard case. Finally, note from Equation (7)

that the presence of

2 bj

ensures

that

the

consumer 's

beliefs will never converge to the true quality, even

with infinite exposures. There is a bias in ad expec-

tations, bj bj , which never goes to zero. This is in contrast to the Bayesian learning model, where the

consumer converges to the true quality given a suffi-

ciently large number of ad signals.

2.2.2. The Evolution of a Consumer's Qual-

ity Evaluations Based on Her Consumption Set:

Accounting for Confirmatory Bias and Bounded

Rationality. Consider the case where the consumer

purchases brand j in period t - 1. Let j t-1 be the noisy quality signal received by the consumer

from brand j's consumption at the end of occasion

t - 1. In the standard Bayesian learning model, the

consumption signal can be written as j t-1 = qj + c jt-1, which is equivalent to saying that the signal
is distributed around the true quality qj as j t-1  N qj 2 . Here, is the extent of ambiguity in the consumption signal, or equivalently the inverse of the

informational value of one consumption experience.

The greater the ambiguity, the less useful is a con-

sumption experience in informing the consumer of

the true quality of the brand. Given this signal, we

can easily update beliefs based on the consumption

set in a Bayesian manner.

A crucial assumption in the standard Bayesian

learning model, however, is that advertising does

not alter evaluations of the subsequent consumption

experience, i.e., prior ads and subsequent consump-

tion signals are independent pieces of information

about the brand's quality. The transformative effect

suggests the opposite. This effect suggests that as the

consumer uses the consumption experience to test the

tentative hypotheses that ad signals have led her to

form, her ad-based expectations influence what she

learns.

Formally, consider the case where the consumer

receives Nj t advertisements for brand j,

, nj t
jr r=1

between occasions 0 and t, and the consumer con-

sumes brand j just prior to occasion t. From Equa-

tion (7), the consumer's ad-based expectations are

given as

a jt

=

1/Nj t

Nj t r =1

adj jr

,

whose

stochastic

specification we can write as

a jt

=

qj

+

bj bj +

j /Nj t

Nj t r =1

j r.

The

presence

of

the

bj bj term

clearly introduces a bias in the ad-based expectations.

Now, the consumer treats these ad-based expectations

of brand j as a tentative hypothesis and tests them

on consumption of brand j at the end of occasion

t - 1 (assuming brand j was purchased at occasion

t - 1). As suggested by Hoch and Deighton (1989),

this results in a confirmatory bias in which the biases

in the ad-based expectations get transferred to the

information about the quality learned from subse-

quent consumption. We parsimoniously model this by

letting the ad-based expectations be correlated with

the consumption signal--or specifically, we let the

bias error in the ad-based expectations be correlated

with the consumption signal with a correlation j . To reiterate, j determines the extent to which biases in ad-based expectations are transferred onto consump-

tion, i.e., the extent to which they help transform eval-

uations of the consumption experience. This would,

in turn, be a reflection of the extent to which there

is a match between the attributes suggested in the

ad and the brand attributes that can be seen during

consumption.10

Given the assumption that the consumption signal

is correlated with the bias in the ad signal, bj bj , with a correlation j , it can be shown that the consumption signal is correlated with the ad-based expecta-

tions with a correlation of j bj /

2 bj

+

2 j

/Nj

t.

This

expression accords well with much of the behavioral

literature discussed earlier. In particular:

(a) It depends on j --the greater the tightness between ads and consumption, the greater is the

impact of ads on subsequent consumption.

(b) It depends on the uncertainty surrounding the

mean bias belief. The lower the bj , the lower the biases in ad-based expectations, and hence the lower

the correlation between ad-based expectations and

consumption. This maps well into behavioral liter-

ature suggesting that if bj is small, consumers do not perceive ads to be biased and thus have little

incentive to test the attributes suggested by the ads.

This, in turn, suggests a smaller impact of ads on

consumption.

(c) It depends on the number of ads seen prior to

consumption. This follows from behavioral literature,

which says that the greater the N , the lower the noise

10 Note that we have modeled confirmatory bias in a semistructural fashion using the exogenous correlation . A discussion of how one could relax this is deferred to the conclusions section.

in the ad-based expectations, the clearer the hypothe-

ses (or frame) that needs to be tested by the consump-

tion experience, and hence the higher the impact of

ads on consumption.

Once we accommodate the fact that the consump-

tion signal is correlated with ad-based expectations,

the distribution of the consumption signal that is

received at the end of occasion t - 1 would depend on

past advertisements,

jr

We have already modified the standard Bayesian

learning model to accommodate source credibil-

ity and confirmatory bias. The third aspect of the

transformative effect--namely, bounded rationality--

is implied in the following question: Is the consumer

aware of the transference of bias from ads to con-

sumption? If the consumer were aware of this trans-

ference, then she would rationally discount it, and

there would be no transformation of consumption. We

have already discussed this issue at some length in

the section on modeling challenges, drawing on Hoch

and Deighton (1989). Briefly, we suggest that the ratio-

nal discounting does not happen because consumers

seldom suspect the credibility of their own consump-

tion experiences, instead naively believing that con-

sumption is an unbiased source of information that is

not affected by external forces such as ads (Hoch and

Ha 1986). In this sense, the consumer is boundedly

rational.

Bounded rationality implies that the consumer

assumes the transformed consumption signals (

T j

t-1)

to be independent of the ad-based expectations while

updating her evaluations from consumption. For the

consumer, the transformed consumption signals are

thus IID draws across purchase occasions, distributed

as

T j

t-1



N

qj

2). Therefore, we can obtain the con-

sumer's evaluations based on her consumption set at

occasion t (qjc t) by updating her beliefs based on her

consumption set at occasion t - 1 (qjc t-1), with the

transformed consumption signal (

T j

t-1),

in

a

Equation (9) shows the updating mechanism of the quality evaluations from the consumer's perspective. It is worthwhile again to highlight the comparison with the standard Bayesian learning model. Because the consumer is unaware that transformation is truly taking place, the updating mechanism of beliefs (based on the consumption set) from the consumer's perspective is the same in both the standard case and in our modified model.
2.2.3. Mixing Advertising and Consumption Sets: The Evolution of a Consumer's Overall Quality Evaluations.
(a) From the consumer's perspective. So far, we have derived the evolution of the consumer's brand evaluation based on her advertising set in Equation (7) and the evolution of her brand evaluation based on her consumption set in Equation (9). Furthermore, Equation (3) shows how the consumer mixes her evaluations from the advertising and consumption sets to get her overall quality evaluation of a brand. Combining Equations (7), (9), and (3), we get the expression for the evolution of the mean and precision of consumer's overall quality evaluations at occasion t as

ads to one ad; and

2 j

=

2 j

+

2 bj

is the ratio of

the informational value of one ad to the informa-

tional value of one consumption experience. The term

j t-1 j t-1 represents the impact of overall evaluations at t - 1. Intuitively, if precision at t - 1 ( j t-1) is high, evaluations at t - 1 would be weighted heav-

ily, thus reducing the impact of informative effects

and of transformed consumption. The term dj t-1

T j t-1

captures the impact of transformed consumption of

the brand purchased at occasion t - 1 and con-

sumed at the end of occasion t - 1, and the term

The

Nj t-1 r =1

and

in

Equation

(10),

while deterministic from the consumer's perspec-

tive, are random variables from the analyst's perspec-

tive. Deriving the stochastic specification of these two

terms is necessary to get the stochastic specification

for the evolution of the overall mean quality evalua-

tions. We do this below.

First, consider the advertising signal,

adj jr

.

The

con-

sumer has beliefs about the true bias, bj ; in particular,

she assumes a mean bias of b¯j , with some uncertainty

denoted by bj . The analyst does not know either the

true bias or the consumer's mean belief, b¯j . However,

given a string of purchase observations across a set of

consumers, he can estimate bj = bj - b¯j . Thus, from

the analyst's perspective, the rth ad signal would

be given as written as

adj jr

=

qj

+

bj

-

b¯ j

+

j j r , which can be

adj jr

=

qj

+

bj +

j jr

(11)

This implies that the ad-based expectation at occasion t from the analyst's perspective will be

1 Nj t Nj t r=1

adj jr

=

Nj t

bj

j
Nj t

r =1

jr

which can be written as

1 Nj t Nj t r=1

adj jr

bj +

Nj t

(12)

 where ij t-1 = 1/ Nj t

Nj t r =1

j r is the cumulative ad

error, which is a standard normal random variable

that is IID across all brands, all purchase occasions,

and all consumers. We can now write the stochas-

tic specification of the term

2 j

t

/Nj

r=1 j r

2 j

(13)

Next, consider the consumption signal at t - 1

(

T j

t-1)

from

the

analyst's

perspective.

While

the

con-

sumer believes her consumption is not transformed

by past ad expectations, i.e., that the consumption sig-

nal is an unbiased and IID random draw from j t-1  N qj 2), the analyst knows that the consumption

signal is transformed, with a distribution given in Equation (8). We can rewrite Equation (8) as

(14)

where cj t-1 is the pure consumption error, which is a standard normal random variable that is IID across all brands, all purchase occasions, and all consumers. Substituting the stochastic specification for the ad signal from Equation (12), we get the stochastic specification of the transformed consumption signal as

has

earlier

as

the

ratio

of the uncertainty in the bias beliefs of the consumer

to the noise in the advertising signal. Intuitively, there

is no transformative effect if bj = 0 or = 0, i.e., if either the consumer knows the exact bias in the

ads or if the consumption experience is completely

unambiguous. Both of these follow from our concep-

tualization, wherein source credibility and consump-

tion ambiguity are cornerstones of the transformative

effect.

Finally, substituting the stochastic specification of

The informative effect of advertisements.

2 j

bj captures the informative effect of nj t advertise-

ments. This has three elements to it: (a) the informa-

tional value of one ad, as captured by

2 j

(defined

earlier in §2.2.3 as

2 j

=

2/

2 j

+

2 bj

),

which

is

an

inverse function of the sum of the two variances

in the ad signals--the variance of the noise that

results from message clarity,

2 j

,

and

the

variance

of the perceived bias of brand j,

2 bj

;

(b)

the

differ-

ence between the mean of the advertising signals,

qj + bj , and the consumer's prior mean quality belief of brand j at t - 1, ej t-1. The greater this difference, the greater the informative effect of ads; (c) the ratio

of the informational value of nj t ads to the informa-

tional value of one ad, as captured by the term

2 jt

=

Nj t sj2 + 1 / Nj tsj2 +1 . Note that this term decreases

as sj2

increases.

This implies that the total effect of the transformed

consumption signal is split between the effect of pure

consumption (i.e., when j = 0) and the transformational effect of advertising. In effect, the formulation

is an averaging process where the effect of pure con-

sumption gets reduced when transformation takes

place. The strength of the averaging is determined by

the extent of transformation ( j ), the ambiguity in the consumption experience ( ), the extent of consumer

uncertainty about the biases in the ads (

2 bj

;

note

that

sj and

j are functions of

2 bj

),

and

the

estimated

dif-

ference between the true bias in ads and consumer

beliefs of the mean bias ( bj ).

3. Data, Estimation, and Analysis
3.1. Data We estimate the model on single-source scanner panel data on liquid and powdered laundry detergent, collected by A. C. Nielsen, Inc. in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota market. Our reasons for choosing the liquid detergent product category are fourfold. First, some prior research efforts that have tried to demonstrate the multiple effects of advertisements have used the same category (Deighton et al. 1994, Erdem and Keane 1996), permitting easy comparison. Second, prior behavioral research has suggested that transformative effects are usually associated with lowinvolvement routinized purchase behavior that is typical for the liquid detergent category (Vakratsas and Ambler 1999). Third, Erdem and Keane (1996) have found significant consumption ambiguity in this product category (a result we replicate in §3.3.2), thus suggesting transformation can play a significant role. Fourth, the data set contains the introduction of two new products, which makes it well suited for studying the learning process. Finally, Mehta et al. (2004) have found significant consumer forgetting of quality evaluations in this category. They find a half-life of 20 weeks for information learned from consumption-- because our data span more than twice this period, it seems reasonable to suppose that all learning has not ceased.
The liquid detergent data span a 153-week period from 1986 to 1988. Advertising information, however, is available for only the last 51 weeks of this period. We select households for our sample according to the following criteria, which are similar to prior papers that have used these data (e.g., Erdem and Keane 1996). We select households that have (a) a history of purchase as well as of viewing commercials, (b) purchase liquid detergent products more than 80% of the time (as compared to powdered detergent), and (c) purchase liquid detergent at least 20 times in the 153-week period. This leaves us with information on

shopping trips and advertising exposures for a panel

of 221 households consisting of 2,549 purchase occa-

sions. We use 150 households (1,750 purchase occa-

sions) as our estimation sample and 71 households

(739 purchase occasions) as our holdout sample. We

have data on five brands: Cheer, Surf, Era, Wisk, and

Tide, which together account for 65.4% of the mar-

ket share in this product category. Of these, Cheer

and Surf were introduced in the sample period--

the presence of new products means that quality

uncertainty is likely to be high, suggesting a role for

learning and possibly of advertising influencing this

learning. Finally, note that we aggregate data from

the SKU level to the brand level using a weighted

sum, with the market shares within the brand as

weights. Table 1 presents key descriptive statistics for

the data.

Specifying Initial Conditions. We know that our data

do not encompass the entire choice history of each

household in our sample (i.e., they are left truncated).

This has implications for what we assume about

the prior mean and variance of the quality percep-

tions. If one does not control for initial choice history,

the implicit assumption is that every household has

the same prior mean and variance across all brands.

Clearly, this is erroneous. A household that has pur-

chased a brand multiple times in the past would

presumably have more informed priors than another

household that has purchased that brand very little.

Similarly, a household that has purchased brand j

multiple times would know its quality better than that

of brand k, which it rarely buys. In essence, we have

to account for the heterogeneity of priors in the sam-

ple. To do so, we follow an approach that is simi-

lar in spirit to that used in Mehta et al. (2004) and

Erdem et al. (2006). Note that because our advertis-

ing data cover only the last 51 weeks of our 153-week

sample period, we can use the first 102 weeks as a

pre-estimation sample to estimate the distribution of

priors. To aid exposition, we label the start and end

of the preestimation period as T0 and T1, respectively. Formally, at T0, let quality perceptions for brand j be distributed as

qij 0  N

0

2 0

(17)

where (following the reparameterization used in

§2.2.3) the prior variance of household i's quality

belief of brand j at the beginning of the preestimation

sample ( 02), can be written in terms of the prior precision at the beginning of the preestimation sample

( 0) and the variance in the noise in the consumption

signal ( 2) as

2 0

=

2

-1 0

.

Note

that

the

mean

and

the

variance of these priors are assumed to be the same

across all consumers and all brands.

At T1 (which is also the beginning of the estimation sample), quality perceptions are distributed as

qe ij  N

2 e ij

(18)

where

the

of

can be written in terms of the precision at the end of

the preestimation sample ( e ij ), and the noise in the

consumption signal ( 2), as

2 e

ij

=

2

-1 e ij

.

Our objective is to get the specifications of the mean

and precision at the end of the preestimation sample

(Equation (18)) as a function of (a) the priors in the

preestimation sample, Equation (17), and (b) the num-

ber of consumption experiences that household i has

had with brand j in the preestimation sample.

Consider the case in which household i has had

T1 t=To

dij

t

consumption

experiences

(which

is

equal

to

the number of times household i has purchased j in

the preestimation sample). This implies that house-

hold i would have received

d T1
t=To ij

t

consumption

signals of brand j in the preestimation sample. These

signals would result in (a) a reduction in house-

hold i's variance in the quality beliefs of brand j from

0 to e ij , and (b) a shift in the mean of household i's

quality evaluations of brand j from 0 to e ij . Similar

in spirit to Erdem et al. (2006), we specify e ij as a

function of 0 and the number of purchases

d T1
t=To ij t

in the preestimation sample in the following reduced-

form fashion:

e ij = 0 + k1 dijt 0 < k1 < 1

(19)

The specification in Equation (19) suggests that the

greater the number of purchases of brand j, the higher

is dijt, and hence the greater the increase in precision over the preestimation time period. Furthermore,

the parameter k1 captures the notion of forgetting in a nonstructural way--as k1 approaches 1, the extent of forgetting diminishes. To specify the mean of house-

hold i's quality evaluations of brand j at the end

of the preestimation sample, we need to specify the

d T1
t=To ij

t

consumption

signals.

However,

instead

of

specifying each consumption signal that the house-

hold receives over the preestimation period, we can

equivalently think of the consumer as receiving one

cumulative consumption signal that results in an

increase in the precision of household i's quality belief
for brand j from 0 to e ij . As shown by Erdem et al. (2006), this cumulative consumption signal can be represented as ximj , which is distributed as

ximj  N qj

2 xij

(20)

where the variance of the cumulative consumption

signal is related to the variance of a single consump-

tion signal ( 2), and the increase in precision from

consumer i's quality beliefs of brand j in the pre-

estimation period, as

=

lently

t -1. We thus signal as ximj

represent the = qj + xij ij ,

where ij is a standard normal random variable that

is independent across brands and consumers.

Therefore, given the cumulative consumption sig-

nal (ximj ) in Equation (20) and the distribution of the household's prior mean quality of brand j at

the beginning of the preestimation sample in Equa-

tion (17), the mean quality evaluation at the end of

the preestimation sample can be specified as

Equations (21) and (19), respectively, specify the mean
and the precision of consumer i's beliefs about the
quality of brand j at the end of the preestimation sam-
ple. For identification, similar to Mehta et al. (2004),
we impose 0 = 0 for all brands. Thus the parameters to be estimated from the pre-estimation sample are 0 and k1.

3.2. Model Estimation

We have introduced 14 parameters in the model so

far: (a) the true qualities of the five brands, qj 5j=1; (b) the ratio of the informative effects of a single adver-

tising exposure to that of consumption,

;

(c)

the

correlation between ads and consumption, j 5j=1;

(d) the difference between the actual bias in the

brands' advertisements and the consumers' mean

belief of that bias, bj 5j=1; (e) the ratio of the uncertainty in bias beliefs to the noise in the advertising

signal, sj2 5j=1; (f) the persuasive effect for the five

brands,

tion in Deighton et al. (1994)--for space, parameter

estimates for the comparison model are provided

in the Technical Appendix, which can be found at

tion of the modified Deighton et al. (1994) model is

given as

where Nj t-1 represents the number of advertisements seen by the consumer between purchase occasions 0 and t, Nj t-2 represents the number of advertisements seen by the consumer between purchase occasions 0 and t - 1, and dj t-1 is an indicator variable, equal to 1 if the consumer purchases brand j on occasion t - 1 and 0 otherwise.
To compare models, we calculate the AIC for both models. The AIC is given as -2 ln L + 2k, where L is the likelihood and k is the number of parameters. The model with the lower value of AIC is preferred. Our proposed model does better than the reduced form model (AIC of 2,993.42 versus 3,366.68), even though it has a greater number of parameters (41 versus 24).
3.3.1. Results and Discussion of Insights. Parameter estimates for the model are reported in Table 4. We summarize our discussion of the parameter estimates under the following broad substantive areas.
True qualities. Tide has the highest true quality (q5 = 4 1653), followed by Era (q3 = 4 1028), Cheer (q1 = 3 9217), Surf (q2 = 3 4792), and Wisk (q4 = 3 1096). One can think of these as constituting two groupings, with Era and Tide constituting the "high-quality" group and the other three brands forming the "low-quality" group.
Perceived quality beliefs at the beginning of the estimation sample. Based on the estimates of k1 and 0 at the

beginning of the preestimation sample (as discussed

in §3.1), we can calculate the mean and variance of

the perceived quality beliefs averaged across all con-

sumers in the sample. The estimates of these tell us

whether there is still potential for learning (and hence

a role for informative and transformative effects of

ads) in the estimation sample. We get the perceived

mean quality belief at the beginning of the estimation

sample averaged across all consumers for Cheer as

0.46, for Surf as 0.62, for Era as 1.05, for Wisk as 0.94,

and for Tide as 1.10. Similarly, we get the average per-

ceived variance in the consumers' quality beliefs at

the beginning of the estimation sample for Cheer as

1.50, for Surf as 1.44, for Era as 1.34, for Wisk as 1.29,

and for Tide as 1.33. Notice that although the new

brands (Cheer and Surf) are associated with higher

uncertainty in their perceived qualities, the average

uncertainty in the established brands is also reason-

ably high. Even though our context is a mature prod-

uct category, the uncertainty about perceived qualities

can come from various sources--it could be because

of the introduction of two new products during the

sample period, or because consumers are aware of the

quality of only a few products and not the entire set.

Perceived bias in advertisements. In our formulation,

consumers attributed a certain mean bias to a brand's

ads (b¯j ), with some variance around this mean ( bj ).

We are able to estimate bj (which is bj - b¯j ). For

the variance, we calculate bj from estimated param-

eters (to see this, note that we have estimates of sj2 =

2 bj

/

2j ,

2 j

=

2/

2 j

+

2 bj

and

2. From these, we can

calculate bj ). Focusing on the variance of the per-

ceived biases in the ads of each of the brands first, one

would expect older brands to have a lower variance.

Also, to the extent that the ads have been successful

in informing consumers of true quality in the past, the

variance of the bias should be lower. In line with intu-

ition, the two new products, Cheer ( b1 = 4 5992) and Surf ( b2 = 4 1677), have the highest variances, i.e., the consumer is most uncertain about the bias in the ads

of Cheer and Surf. These are followed by Tide ( b5 = 3 9937), Wisk ( b4 = 3 2429), and Era ( b3 = 2 8166).
As for bj , a positive value for a brand would suggest that the consumer thinks ads for this brand

are less biased than what they actually are, while

a negative value would suggest the opposite. These

perceptions could be affected by a variety of fac-

tors, such as the content of the ad or information

that affects the credibility of the source. Both Cheer

( b1 = -0 9221) and Wisk ( b4 = -2 1250) seem to suffer from worse source credibility issues than they

"deserve"; on the other hand, the consumer discounts

the bias in the advertisements of Era ( b3 = 2 3707), Surf ( b2 = 1 6819), and Tide ( b5 = 1 1290) less than is warranted.

Extent of ambiguity in consumption. We follow Hoch and Ha (1986) and operationalize ambiguity in consumption as an increasing function of the consumption experience variability and a decreasing function of the variability between the true qualities of the different brands. Note that experience variability is just the noise in the consumption signal, , whose estimate is 2.0843. Furthermore, the variability between the true qualities of the brands can be represented by the standard deviation across the estimates of the true qualities of the five brands, i.e., stdev (q1 q2 q3 q4 q5). Therefore, we can mathematically represent consumption ambiguity as the ratio of the noise in consumption to the standard deviation of the estimates of the true qualities across brands. If the value of this

ratio is greater than 1, consumption ambiguity is high; if the ratio is close to zero, consumption ambiguity is low. Using our estimates of the true qualities for the five brands, we obtain a standard deviation of 0.4499. Therefore, the consumption ambiguity is 2 0843/0 4499 = 4 6329, which is significantly greater than 1. This implies that consumption ambiguity is significant in the liquid detergent category, and we can reasonably expect advertising to have a transformative effect.
Risk aversion. We find that consumers are significantly risk averse in this category (r = -1 1590). This is consistent with prior literature (Erdem and Keane 1996, Byzalov and Shachar 2004), which has also emphasized the importance of controlling for risk

effects.

Total ad elasticity. Table 5 summarizes ad effects

in the form of elasticities. Note that Surf, Era, and

Tide do reasonably well on total advertising elastic-

ity, while Cheer and Wisk do poorly. We examine the

informative and transformative components of the

total advertising elasticity below.

Informative effect of advertisements. As discussed ear-

lier, the informative effect depends on three things.

First, the informational value of one ad, as captured

by 2j , which is an inverse function of the sum of two variances in the ad signals (the variance of the noise

that

results

from

message

clarity

(

2 j

)

and

the

vari-

ance of the perceived bias of brand j

2 bj

)).

Note

that

the greater the value of

2 j

for

brand

j,

the

greater

the informational value of each brand j's ad, imply-

ing a higher informative effect. Second, the difference

or the gap between the mean of the advertising sig-

nals (qj + bj ) and the consumer's prior mean quality belief of brand j at the beginning of the estimation

sample ( e ij ); the larger the gap, the greater the extent of change in quality evaluations after seeing the ads,

leading to a greater informative effect. Third, the ratio

of the variance of the perceived biases in brand j's ad

to the noise in brand j's ad (sj2 =

2 bj

/

2 j

).

The

higher

the value of sj2, the lower the marginal impact of each

successive ad on the quality evaluations, leading to a

lower informative effect. To aid comparison, we cal-

culate the informative elasticities for all five brands,

shown in Table 5. Furthermore, Table 6a shows each

of the components affecting the informative elasticity

for all the brands.

Focusing on the elasticities, note that the rank

ordering, from greatest to least informative effects

is Era, Surf, Tide, Wisk, and Cheer. This result can

be explained on the basis of the three factors dis-

cussed above. The result for Era can be understood

by observing that Era has a high value of the gap

=5 4140 , the highest value of

2 j

=0 2874 , and the

lowest value of sj2 (=0 9831) among the five brands.

Also, Cheer is the worst in informative effects because

it has the lowest value of

2 j

(=0

1038),

a

high

value

of sj2 (=1 2191), and a low value of the gap (=2 3562).

Similarly, Wisk has low informative effects because

even though

2 j

(=0

2380)

is

high,

the

gap

(=0

0375)

is very small and sj2 (=1 1645) is high. Finally, Surf

and Tide have relatively higher informative effects.

Tide has high informative effects primarily because

its sj2 (=1 0608) is low, while Surf has high informative effects because its gap (=4 5371) is high (perhaps

because it is a new brand and consumers discount its

ads less than they should).

Transformative effect of advertisements. The transfor-

mative effect goes up as (a) j , the closeness with which the ad is associated with the consumption eval-

uation goes up, (b)

2 bj

,

the

perceived

variance

of

the biases in the ad signals goes up, and (c) bj ,

the magnitude of the residual bias in the ad-based

expectations goes up. Given the number of factors in

play, it is easiest to compare transformative effects by

computing the transformative elasticities, shown in

Table 5. Observe that Surf is the highest, followed by

Era and Tide. Wisk and Cheer have extremely small

transformative elasticities. To gain further insight into

each of the factors affecting the transformative elas-

ticity, Table 6b gives values for each of three elements

( j,

2 bj

,

bj ) for each of the brands.

We can see why Surf has the highest transforma-

tive elasticity--its j , bj , and bj are all high. Era and Tide have reasonable j and high bj , but their transformative effects are not as high as Surf because their

bj is lower (which could be because they are wellestablished brands). Finally, Cheer and Wisk have low

transformation in spite of having a high bj , because their j and bj are both low.

Persuasive effect of advertisements. Most of the persuasive effects ( per ) are insignificant. The only significant effect is that for Wisk. We conjecture that Wisk might be forced to rely on persuasive effects because it has low informative and transformative elasticities. We should note that Ackerberg (2001, 2003), who modeled persuasive effects in the yogurt category, in a manner similar to ours, also found insignificant effects. While some prior papers have found significant persuasive effects, it is important to observe two things. First, as discussed earlier, modeling the persuasive effect through a direct term in the utility captures advertising effects that have not been modeled structurally. It is not clear that these effects constitute what the behavioral literature has called "persuasive effects." Second, Byzalov and Shachar (2004) show that significant persuasive effects could be a result of specification error, namely, the omission of consumer risk aversion. Because we model both informative and transformative effects structurally, and account for risk aversion, our result on persuasive effects is not surprising.
3.3.2. Further Analysis of the Results. 1. Decomposing advertising effects. Temporal Pattern. To examine the impact of advertising effects over time, we conduct the following analysis. Controlling for marketing mix effects, we plot the advertising elasticities for Era over the sample period. We pick Era as a useful brand to focus on because it has reasonable values of both informative and transformative effects. To isolate the effects, we control for variations in consumer purchase patterns and marketing mix effects. To do this, we fix the price, feature, display, and ad intensity for each brand to its average level, and assume each consumer purchases once every four weeks. The curves for the total advertising elasticity as well as the three individual effects are shown in Figure 2a. As expected, informative elasticities are much larger than either transformative or persuasive elasticities. Persuasive effects seem to show no obvious pattern and are fairly low throughout. To see differences in patterns for informative and transformative effects more clearly, we plot two more figures--again for Era. First, we plot the informative and transformative elasticities as a fraction of the total advertising elasticity over time (Figure 2b). Second, we plot the ratio of transformative to informative elasticities over time (Figure 2c). All three figures tell a consistent story, i.e., informative effects are important early on, while transformative elasticities start very low and increase over time. To understand these patterns, note that for informative effects, the temporal pattern comes from learning. As the consumer learns through ads or through consumption, her uncertainty decreases and the marginal

progresses over her purchase history, the number of cumulative ads she sees for a given brand also increases, leading to an increase in the transformative impact of ads on consumption. Thus the total intertemporal change in the transformative elasticities depends on the relative strength of these two forces. Note that in Figures 2a­2c, the transformative elasticities increase over time, which implies that the latter factor (the number of cumulative ads seen) outweighs the former (the extent of uncertainty about quality evaluations).
3.3.3. Policy Experiments. 1. Impact of advertising intensity on advertising effects. In this experiment, we change ad intensity for each brand, defined as the average number of ads seen per household per week, and we examine how this affects the impact of informative and transformative effects on the market share for each brand. We would expect advertising effects to increase with increase in ad intensity. We perform the experiment by varying ad intensity from 0.1 to 0.7 (the average ad intensity in the data for Era is 0.5). To isolate the effect of ad intensity, we control for variations in consumer purchase patterns and marketing mix effects. To do this, we fix the price, feature, and display for each brand to its average level and assume that each consumer purchases once every four weeks. Instead of plotting multiple curves at each ad intensity level, we do the following. We first calculate the overall difference in market share at an ad intensity of 0.7 versus 0.1. Figure 3a shows that the market share is greater with the higher ad intensity, as one would expect. We then divide the market share difference calculated above, at each time, into three components, representing the market share change because of the informative, transformative, and persuasive effects, respectively. We divide each of these components by the total market share change, to normalize. Figure 3b plots these ratios for Era. The pattern buttresses our earlier findings about the temporal pattern of these effects. The initial sharp change in market share is almost entirely because of the informative effect. This attenuates over time, with the transformative effect taking over. The persuasive effect, by contrast, remains fairly constant in its impact on market share. 2. Impact of advertising effects on competitive clout and vulnerability. Viewing advertising effects in terms of current users and nonusers, one can say that informative effects are most useful in influencing current nonusers of the product (a group that mainly consists of those that have little experience with the brand), while transformative effects have their maximum impact on current users. Because this is the case, enhancing informative effects should help a

brand attract a greater number of current nonusers-- it should have less impact on current users. Conversely, enhancing transformative effects should help a brand keep a greater number of users who might be tempted to switch brands otherwise--it should have less impact on current nonusers. This maps on in an obvious manner to the concepts of clout and vulnerability, that we now turn to.11 The price elasticity matrix for all the brands, as well their clout and vulnerability, is shown in Table 7.

11 Competitive clout is defined as the share of customers that a brand
would attract from the competing brands if it engages in a price cut. Clout for brand j is given as k=j Ek2j , where Ekj is the percentage change in the market share of brand k when there is a 1%
decrease in the price of brand j (Kamakura and Russell 1989). Vul-
nerability is defined as the fractional share brand would lose to the
competing brands if they were to offer a price discount. For brand j it is defined as k=j Ej2k, where Ejk is the percentage change in the market share of brand j when there is a 1% decrease in the price
of brand k (Kamakura and Russell 1989).

Informative effects. Consider a brand (subsequently

referred to as the focal brand) whose true quality is

greater than the quality beliefs of its current non-

users. If such a brand engages in a price cut, it will

attract some current nonusers (i.e., consumers who

were purchasing the competing brands). If the focal

brand enhances the informative effects of its adver-

tising, it can increase consumers' perceived quality

evaluations. In such a case, if the brand engages in

a price cut, it will be able to attract a much larger

fraction of its nonusers. This implies that an increase

in informative effects serves to increase the compet-

itive clout for such a brand. Next, if a competing

brand were to offer a price discount, it would attract

some of the current users of the focal brand. Because

informative effects have relatively little impact on the

quality evaluations of current users, enhancing these

effects will not help the focal brand prevent the loss

of its customers because of a competitor's price cut.

In other words, increasing informative effects would

only have a marginal impact on the focal brand's vul-

nerability. In summary, if a brand's true quality is

higher than the perceived quality evaluations of its

nonusers, enhancing informative effects would primarily

serve to increase the brand's competitive clout, but will not

significantly impact its vulnerability.

To see if this conjecture holds, we run the follow-

ing experiment. We vary the informative effect for

Era by varying

is

the

ratio of the informational value of one ad to the infor-

mational value of one consumption experience), from

20% of its estimated value to 180% of its estimated

value. Next, we compute Era's competitive clout and

vulnerability. Figure 4a shows the change in clout

and vulnerability as the magnitude of the informative

effect increases. The conjecture seems clearly borne out--increasing informative effects primarily serves to increase the brand's competitive clout but does not substantially change its vulnerability. The managerial implication of this is clear: for a brand with a sufficiently loyal base of consumers, such that losing customers to competing brands is a smaller issue than attracting new customers, enhancing informative effects is very useful. On the other hand, emphasizing informative effects will be of little value for brands with a customer base prone to switching.
Transformative effects. Transformative effects acquire relevance only when accompanied by consumption; clearly, they have no impact on consumers who have never used the focal brand. This suggests that emphasizing transformative effects is not an effective acquisition strategy; in other words, increasing this effect should have little impact on the clout of the focal brand. On the other hand, if the competing brands engage in a price cut, they will attract the current users of the focal brand. Because the focal brand can increase the perceived quality evaluations of its current users by engaging in high transformative effects, increasing transformative effects would make the brand less vulnerable. In summary, increasing transformative effects would primarily serve to decrease the brand's vulnerability but will not significantly impact its competitive clout.
To see if this conjecture holds, we run the following experiment. We vary the transformative effect for Era, by varying j (the tightness of the connection between ads and the consumption experience) from 20% of its estimated value to 180% of its estimated value. Following that, we compute Era's competitive clout and vulnerability. Figure 4b shows the change in clout and vulnerability as the magnitude of the transformative effect increases. Observe that vulnerability is affected more than clout. The managerial implication of this is clear: for a brand with a relatively weak base of loyal consumers, such that losing customers to competing brands is a bigger issue than attracting new customers, enhancing transformative effects is very useful.
3. Impact of Consumption Ambiguity on Advertising Effects. Our model suggests that greater levels of consumption ambiguity would lead to greater advertising effects, consistent with prior behavioral literature. This is reasonable--the smaller the role of consumption in reducing uncertainty about quality evaluations, the greater the role of other signals, such as advertising. To see this, we perform an exercise similar to Hoch and Ha (1986), who considered transformative effects for two categories with varying levels of ambiguity--paper towels and polo shirts. They found that the transformative effect was higher for the category with a higher level of ambiguity; namely,

polo shirts. In a similar fashion, we plot informative and transformative elasticities versus consumption ambiguity by varying the latter from 20% to 180% of its estimated value in our sample. Figure 5 shows the plot for Era. As expected, increasing consumption ambiguity has a positive impact on both informative and transformative effects.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a formal model of consumer behavior that explicitly details the processes through which the informative and transformative effects of advertisements impact a consumer's brand evaluations and subsequent brand choice decisions. In addition, we also account for persuasive effects. Our model hews closely to prior behavioral research that has discussed the transformative effect and the confirmatory bias at the heart of the effect. In our empirical analysis, we find significant effects of advertising along both informative and transformative dimensions. We perform policy experiments to uncover the temporal variation in informative and transformative effects across time. We find that informative effects predominate early on in the learning period but then taper off. Transformative effects follow exactly the opposite pattern.
Our study suffers from some limitations, which could be avenues for future research. First, we have not modeled the decay of advertising effects explicitly. One way to incorporate advertising decay in our structural framework would be to model evaluations as being recalled imperfectly because of forgetting. While an interesting extension, this would complicate the model significantly. Furthermore, as suggested by Mehta et al. (2004), the impact of advertising would

Mehta, Chen, and Narasimhan: Disentangling the Multiple Effects of Advertising on Brand Choice Decisions

354

only be enhanced if we were to incorporate the forgetting of advertisements in our model. Second, we have modeled confirmatory bias in a semi-structural way by allowing an exogenous correlation between ad-based expectations and the subsequent consumption signal. A completely structural approach would be to formally model the hypothesis testing behavior of the consumer. To do so, we would need to model the fact that the consumer forms a hypothesis that the ad-based expectation is the true quality and tests this hypothesis using the subsequent consumption signal as a datum. As a result of this exercise, the transformed consumption signal would be a convex combination of the true consumption signal and the ad-based expectations. Thus the biases in the ad-based expectations would flow to the transformed consumption signal, endogenously creating correlations between the consumption signal and the adbased expectations. Modeling this is likely to involve significant complications (Boulding et al. 1999, the only other paper that has modeled confirmatory bias, also does so in a semi-structural manner).
Third, bounded rationality enters our model only as it relates to the impact of ads, i.e., consumers are unaware that their consumption evaluations are being transformed by ads. Future research could consider other elements of bounded rationality, e.g., biases such as the "base rate fallacy" that lead consumers to update in a fashion that deviates from the Bayesian rule (Bar-Hillel 1980). Fourth, we do not have information on the content of advertising in our data. If one had access to such data, one could correlate specific features of ads to the magnitude of the informative and transformative effects. Fifth, while our data are on purchase, the model is formulated around consumption. If consumers consume at a time very different from the purchase time, that could impact our results. It would certainly be useful to model consumption decisions explicitly (Erdem et al. 2006, Sun et al. 2003, Sun 2005). Finally, while we have examined the impact of changing informative and transformative effects, it would be useful to consider how the differential roles played by such advertising could lead to better targeting of advertising (Iyer et al. 2005). In a similar vein, it would be useful to supplement our analysis by considering the profitability of enhancing one or more of advertising's effects (Sriram et al. 2006), or examining competitive strategy more finely along various dimensions of advertising effects (Steenkamp et al. 2005).
