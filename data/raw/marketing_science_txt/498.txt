We study a duopoly model where consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their willingness to pay for two product characteristics and marginal costs are increasing with the quality level chosen on each attribute. We show that although firms seek to manage competition through product positioning, their differentiation strategies critically depend on how costly it is to provide higher quality. When the cost of providing quality is not too high, firms use only one attribute to differentiate their products: they maximally differentiate on one dimension and minimally differentiate on the other (a Max-Min equilibrium). Furthermore, they always differentiate along the dimension with the greater attribute range. As for the dimension with the smaller range and along which they agglomerate, firms either choose the highest quality level or the lowest quality level possible, depending on whether the marginal costs of quality provision are low or intermediate, respectively. However, for larger quality provision costs, firms exploit both dimensions to differentiate their products. In particular, we characterize a maximal differentiation equilibrium in which one firm chooses the highest quality level on both attributes while its rival offers the lowest quality level on both attributes (a Max-Max equilibrium). We discuss the managerial implications of our findings and explain how they enrich and qualify previous results reported in the literature on two-dimensional differentiation models.

1. Introduction
Product positioning is perhaps one of the most important decisions that marketing managers need to make (Kotler and Keller 2008). It is a decision that affects the selection of key marketing mix variables, such as price, and that has considerable implications for a firm's profits. In many instances, the set of product dimensions relevant for consumer choice in the category are known, and the positioning decision boils down to determining how much of each attribute or product characteristic to provide. In making this decision, the firm has to balance a desire to offer a product that is more appealing to customers with the need to be mindful about how costly such a product is to produce. When facing competition, however, the positioning decision needs to take into account not only consumer preferences and production costs but also the positioning of rivals. Specifically, how differentiated should firms' products be from each other?
When there is only a single product dimension relevant for consumer choice, we would naturally expect firms to manage competition through differentiation

along that dimension. For example, if consumers care mainly about the speed of a microprocessor, then competition would likely prompt one firm to offer a high-speed processor while its rival offers a lowspeed one. Moreover, delivering faster processors that pack more transistors onto a single chip costs more to produce and is typically priced higher.1
However, in many markets customers base their purchase decisions on multiple product attributes. For example, in purchasing a hybrid electric vehicle, consumers might care about the effective miles per gallon the vehicle is estimated to achieve and the car's safety ratings or maximum cargo capacity. In a businessto-business context, digital storage solutions are typically evaluated on their capacity to store data as well as how quickly data can be accessed for processing.2
1 In the case of PC microprocessors, for example, throughout the 1990s, Intel chips were on average 50% faster than AMD processors and were priced 50%­100% higher (Ofek 2007). 2 For example, throughout the 2000s, the two prominent hybrid models sold, the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, were mainly

In these multiattribute contexts, firms have much more flexibility in terms of how they position their products relative to their competitors, and the desire to differentiate can therefore take on a number of forms. For example, competing firms could locate their products to achieve differentiation on all attributes, or they could differentiate only on one attribute and remain undifferentiated on others. Moreover, in the case of differentiation on only one attribute, several configurations are possible, raising such questions as, which attribute should firms use to differentiate their products, and what level should firms offer on the nondifferentiated attribute?
In this paper, we study a duopolistic market in which consumer preferences are heterogeneous and are affected by the levels chosen on two vertical product attributes. Firms decide on their product positioning in the attribute space in the first stage and on pricing in the second stage. Our model incorporates the fact that the greater the performance or quality the firm wishes to provide on a given attribute, the more costly production becomes. In all the examples given above, this is clearly the case (more efficient hybrid fuel engines, more crash-mitigating safety features, greater storage capacity, and faster data retrieval all cost more to produce). In this context, where profitability depends on the confluence of demand generation, cost containment, and competitive intensity, we seek to understand how firms select their product positions in the multiattribute space.
Our analysis reveals several important findings. First, we show that when the cost of quality provision is not too high, then any equilibrium of the game must exhibit the Max-Min property: firms will choose to be maximally differentiated on one attribute, i.e., one firm selects the highest possible level while its rival selects the lowest possible level on that attribute, and to be minimally differentiated on the other attribute, i.e., both firms select the same level on the other attribute. Second, we shed light on the nature of the Max-Min equilibria to expect. Specifically, we find that the dimension that firms maximally differentiate on has the greatest attribute range or span. As for the attribute firms minimally differentiate on, the outcome depends on how costly it is to provide quality: if this cost is low, both firms will offer the highest possible level on that attribute. Conversely, if this cost is intermediate, they will both offer the lowest possible level. Finally, in cases where the cost of providing quality is high, we find that firms
evaluated on gas savings (based on the effective miles per gallon) and safety ratings. In the storage area network market in the 1990s and early 2000s, Brocade and McData were the major competitors, and storage capacity and data access were important purchase criteria (Gourville et al. 2002, Ofek and Mamoon 2005).

will differentiate on both attributes. We further characterize the conditions for such a Max-Max equilibrium in which one firm selects the highest possible level on both attributes while its rival selects the lowest possible levels. Taken together, our findings offer clarity on the topic of product positioning when there is more than one attribute to consider and uncover an interesting interplay between firms' strategic considerations and the need to manage the costs of quality provision.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section we relate our work to the extant literature on product positioning when there is more than one product dimension. The model setup is described in §3. Section 4 analyzes the model starting with the pricing equilibrium in §4.1, followed by the equilibrium in choice of attribute levels in §4.2. In §5 we discuss in greater detail why certain equilibria presented in prior literature do not exist and also relax several model assumptions. Section 6 concludes and provides managerial implications. In Appendices A and B we provide the proofs of the claims, lemmas, and propositions presented in this paper.
2. Relevant Literature
The debate about the degree of competitive differentiation started with Hotelling (1929), who introduced the "principle of minimum differentiation"--suggesting that firms should sell the exact same good when consumers have different tastes along a horizontal line.3 This principle was shown not to hold when prices are endogenous (d'Aspremont et al. 1979). Specifically, for a duopoly in which firms choose horizontal product location in the first stage and then compete in prices, the equilibrium is for firms to maximally differentiate (i.e., locate at opposite ends of the line).4 In a vertical differentiation context with one dimension representing quality, Shaked and Sutton (1982) find that firms partially differentiate.
The above literature has provided an excellent understanding of competitive positioning when firms
3 Products are horizontally differentiated when consumers disagree about which type of product provides them with greater utility, holding price constant (for example, two equally priced 16 oz jars of peanut butter, one crunchy and the other creamy, may appeal to different consumers). By contrast, products are vertically differentiated when all consumers agree about the quality ordering of products but differ in how much they are willing to pay for higher quality. For example, all consumers would pick an 80 GB MP3 player over a 20 GB MP3 player--assuming all other characteristics including price are the same--but if the 80 GB version costs more, some consumers would prefer the 20 GB version if they do not place much value on memory capacity.
4 This is true when consumers are uniformly distributed along the line and the transportation cost is quadratic.

decide on the level or location of only one product characteristic. In reality, however, products typically possess several characteristics (i.e., they are multiattribute). When firms have discretion over the levels of more than one dimension, several types of configurations are possible, ranging from firms choosing the same level on all dimensions (no differentiation, i.e., "Min-Min"), to firms choosing as much separation as possible on all dimensions (maximal differentiation, i.e., "Max-Max"), to firms choosing an "in-between" degree of differentiation (e.g., maximal differentiation on one dimension and minimal differentiation on the other, i.e., "Max-Min"; or maximal differentiation on one dimension and partial differentiation on the other, i.e., "Partial-Max"). Recent literature has begun looking at this issue. Much of the research has examined the horizontal case, with a general conclusion that firms never fully differentiate on all dimensions (see Irmen and Thisse 1998 for an analysis of n horizontal characteristics). In a model with one horizontal characteristic and one vertical characteristic, Neven and Thisse (1990) prove the possible coexistence of multiple Max-Min equilibria. Although they do not establish that the Max-Min property must always hold in equilibrium, the authors do show that firms never choose to fully differentiate on both dimensions. In the case of two vertically differentiated characteristics, Vandenbosch and Weinberg (1995) claim to have identified conditions for several types of equilibria to exist (Max-Min, Max-Max, and Partial-Max) with coexistence of multiple Max-Min equilibria over a wide range of the parameter space.
This stream of research on multiattribute product positioning has assumed constant marginal costs of production (typically taken to be zero). Thus, it has ignored the possibility that selecting a product position not only has demand and competitive implications but also affects costs. In particular, in many product categories it is typically the case that higherquality provision (higher level on a desired attribute) comes with higher production costs as well.5 In the single-attribute case, Moorthy (1988) studied the impact of increasing marginal costs and showed that such costs affect equilibrium outcomes.
Relative to the extant literature, our contribution is twofold. First, we revisit the two-dimensional vertical differentiation model and qualify the findings reported in prior work. Specifically, in the special case of marginal costs that are independent of attribute levels chosen (which is the setup in Vandenbosch and Weinberg 1995), we show that the product configurations in equilibrium must display the Max-Min property: one firm sells the best product (highest levels on

all attributes) while its rival maximally differentiates along the attribute with the larger range and agglomerates along the smaller range attribute. Our results further show that for any given set of attribute ranges and cost of quality provision, the equilibrium product configuration is always unique. Second, we characterize the equilibria that arise in the two-dimensional vertical differentiation model when marginal costs do depend on the attribute levels chosen. This analysis reveals that having to consider production costs greatly affects firm positioning decisions and that different types equilibrium strategies can emerge as costs increase. In particular, we identify existence conditions for two distinct types of Max-Min equilibria, for a Max-Max equilibrium, and for a Partial-Max equilibrium. We believe the insights emanating from our analysis greatly enrich the understanding of firm differentiation strategies when there is more than one relevant dimension that affects consumer utility.
3. Model
Let product i in a given category comprise two relevant characteristics, xi and yi. Each of these characteristics is vertically differentiated in the sense that, keeping everything else constant, all consumers prefer higher levels on both characteristics. The market is heterogeneous in that consumers differ in terms of how much they care about quality levels. To be more specific, the utility a consumer derives from buying product i at price pi is V + xxi + yyi - pi where x represents willingness to pay for quality on characteristic x and y represents willingness to pay for quality on characteristic y; x and y are independent and uniformly distributed over 0 1 . Thus, consumer utility is increasing with respect to xi and yi, but the rates of increase reflect consumers' heterogeneity in taste.6
Two identical firms, indexed i  1 2 , compete by choosing their product attributes7 and their price. This duopoly setting is modeled in a two-stage game. In the first stage, firms simultaneously choose both product characteristics. Firms can choose any combination of x y in the feasible set of characteristics x x¯ × y y¯ . The marginal cost of production is linearly increasing with the quality level chosen for each characteristic and is given by cx + cy. The special case of constant marginal costs, which are independent of the quality level chosen, is captured simply by setting c = 0. In the second stage, both firms observe the product characteristics of their competitor and simultaneously choose the price at which
6 Section 5.5 explains how this setup encompasses more general cases in which the roles played by product characteristics in the utility function are less symmetric.
7 We use the terms characteristic and attribute interchangeably.

to sell their product.8 Firms compete à la Bertrand in the pricing stage and maximize their profits i = Di pi - cxi - cyi , where pi and Di are the price and demand of firm i, respectively. Finally, consumers decide to buy one unit from firm 1 or firm 2 because the reservation utility V is assumed to be large enough so that all consumers buy in equilibrium (in §5.5 we discuss the implications of relaxing this assumption to allow for the market to not be fully covered).
Denoting the span (or range) of the x characteristic as x  x¯ - x and the span of the y characteristic as y  y¯ - y, for purposes of the analysis we can assume, without loss of generality, that characteristic x has a larger span than characteristic y; i.e., x 
y. Firms are assumed to be risk neutral and maximize expected payoffs. We focus on subgame-perfect equilibria in pure strategies.
The game is solved through backward induction starting with the pricing subgame derived at the beginning of the next section.
4. Equilibrium Analysis
4.1. Pricing Equilibrium In the pricing subgame, the product characteristics have already been chosen, and we are interested in the price competition that follows. If products are identical, prices are equal to marginal cost, and profits are zero. Therefore, going forward we study the price equilibrium when products are not identical. In solving for the equilibria, what matters is the degree of difference on each of the attributes. A firm's product is said to have a comparative advantage on a given characteristic if the level it offers on that characteristic is higher than what its competitor offers. It is convenient to label the attributes A and a such that A is the attribute with the larger comparative difference and a is the one with the smaller comparative difference. Let the firm whose product has the larger comparative advantage (A) be labeled firm F , and its
8 The multistage setup of our model is consistent with much of the industrial organization literature, whereby product decisions (quality level in our case) are made prior to pricing decisions, with the product decisions known to both firms at the pricing stage (see, for example, Moorthy 1988, Shaked and Sutton 1982, Tirole 1988). This structure is realistic because (a) product design typically needs to be determined before deciding what price is appropriate, (b) product decisions are much more difficult to change in the short run relative to changing prices, and (c) firms often need to make known their product designs in advance of the launch (to prepare the market, get suppliers of complementary products and distributors on board, etc.). As an example, consider videogame console makers that preannounce the exact specs of their next-generation devices years in advance but only set prices shortly before launch (Ofek 2008).

rival is firm f .9 The attributes of the products are thus AF aF for firm F and Af af for firm f . Because by definition firm F has a comparative advantage in attribute A, we have A  AF - Af > 0. Analogously, we can write a  aF - af as the difference between the firms' products on attribute a. If firm F also has a comparative advantage in characteristic a, i.e., a  0, firm F sells a dominant product that is better on both dimensions.10 Otherwise, if a < 0 the products are said to have asymmetric characteristics; in this case firm f has a comparative advantage in a, and firm F has a comparative advantage in A. Finally, by definition the comparative advantage in A is larger than in a, which implies that A  a  0.
In the next subsection, we show that in each region of the parameter space c, a/ A , the subgame pricing equilibrium is unique, and we discuss the various demand structures that emerge. In §4.1.2, we provide the prices and profits in each of these pricing equilibria and characterize the comparative statics that will be relevant at the product positioning stage.
4.1.1. Characterization of the Pricing Equilibrium. Solving the last stage of the game between the firms, we obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 1. For any cost of quality provision c  0 and ratio of quality differences a/ A, the pricing equilibrium is unique. The four types of pricing equilibria that may arise are denoted Eq, Eq, Eq, and Eq. Their existence conditions are given in Table 1.
Figure 1 illustrates the existence regions for each of the four types of pricing equilibria as a function of the cost of quality provision c and the ratio of quality difference a/ A (per Table 1). The subgame equilibria Eq and Eq exist only when firm F has a comparative advantage on both product dimensions (dominant product case; a/ A  0 , Eq exists only when firm f has a comparative advantage on attribute a (asymmetric characteristics case; a/ A  0 and Eq exists in both cases (provided the cost of quality provision is not too high).
9 Firm 1 can be either firm F or firm f depending on whether its product possesses characteristic A. Similarly, characteristic x can either be A or a.
10 We borrow this nomenclature from Vandenbosch and Weinberg (1995).

Note. In Eq, the line representing consumers indifferent between f and F is upward sloping in the asymmetric characteristics case and downward sloping in the dominant product case.

Figure 1 also depicts the demand structure for each of the four equilibria. Because every consumer is characterized by his or her tastes, A for attribute A and a for attribute a, the market demand for each firm can be represented in the unit square of the A a plane. In each case, the demand for firm F is depicted in black and the demand for firm f in white. When in equilibrium a firm only serves consumers with very similar tastes, it is said to follow a niche strategy, and Figure 1 shows a triangular-shaped area in one of the corners of the appropriate market-demand graph. Specifically, it can be gleaned that firm F follows a high-end niche strategy in equilibria Eq and Eq: consumers who buy firm F 's product value high quality on both characteristics in Eq, whereas they mainly care about the A characteristic in Eq. Similarly, firm f follows a low-end niche strategy in Eq by only serving consumers who do not value quality much. By contrast, in Eq neither firm follows a niche strategy, with the shape of demand for both firms forming a trapezoid in the relevant market-demand graph in Figure 1.
Finally, the relative size of the demand for each firm also depends on the cost of quality provision c, because marginal costs affect the prices firms charge in equilibrium. Specifically, when c increases, firm F is relatively more affected than firm f because its product has the larger comparative advantage in quality and is more costly to produce. Firm F thus has a greater incentive than its rival to increase price as marginal costs increase, and consequently, consumers

derive less net utility from its product. Figure 1 illustrates how firm F s demand shrinks while firm f 's demand expands as c increases: the black area representing demand for F becomes smaller when moving up in Figure 1, and the white area becomes larger.
In the next subsection, we discuss the prices and profits in the different equilibria of the pricing subgame and provide comparative statics that will be relevant for solving the first stage of the game.

4.1.2. Prices and Profits. Table 2 provides the

prices and profits in each of the four possible pric-

ing equilibria. It can easily be gleaned that profits and

contribution margins11 depend only on characteristic-

level differences, A and a, and the cost of qual-

ity provision c. Firm F , which sells the product with

the greater comparative advantage, always chooses a

higher price than its rival: pF  pf . However, because quality is costly to produce, firm F earns more than its

As such, the relevant pricing equilibria are Eq, Eq,

increase) is governed by two effects. First, there is a direct effect that reflects how firm j would like to adjust its price pj , assuming firm i keeps pi constant. Specifically, when firm i increases an attribute level while firm j's attributes remain constant, firm j has an incentive to compensate for having to compete with a better product by lowering price to keep its offering attractive to consumers. The direct effect is thus always nonpositive. Second, there is a strategic effect that reflects how firm j would like to adjust price given that firm i is likely to change its price when the level of one of its attributes improves. Specifically, firm i has an incentive to raise price because consumers are willing to pay more for the higher-quality product and because of the greater marginal cost associated with its production. As prices are strategic complements, firm j has an incentive to react to a competitor price increase by raising price as well. Hence, the strategic effect is always positive. The overall impact of an attribute change by firm i on firm

j s price thus depends on whether the direct or strategic effect dominates. As the next lemma shows, the overall impact differs by firm (F or f ) and by attribute (A or a).

Recall that firm F has a comparative advantage

along attribute A (AF > Af . Lemma 2 states that firm f increases its price pf when firm F raises AF (the strategic effect dominates in determining the sign of

pf / AF , whereas firm F increases its price pF when firm f lowers Af (the direct effect dominates in determining the sign of pF / Af . Thus, both firms benefit from their products being located as far apart

as possible along the A characteristic because this

relaxes price competition and allows them to charge

higher prices; this is true for all three subgame pric-

ing equilibria and any cost of quality provision. As

for changes in characteristic a, the comparative statics

depend on which equilibrium is being considered.

Eq and Eq occur only in the dominant product

case when firm F has a comparative advantage on

both characteristics. In these equilibria, both firms

charge higher prices the further away their products

are located along the a characteristic because, simi-

lar to the analysis of changes in characteristic A, this

relaxes price competition.

Finally, Lemma 2 reveals that the comparative stat-

ics with respect to characteristic a in Eq depend on

the cost of quality provision but not on whether F

sells a dominant product (aF  af ). When a firm's a characteristic increases, it raises its marginal costs,

which contributes to the strategic effect by weaken-

ing the firm's competitive standing, and it also raises

consumers' willingness to pay for its product, which

contributes to both the direct effect and the strategic

effect by strengthening the firm's competitive stand-

ing.

the

of marginal costs on the strategic effect is small, and

hence the direct effect dominates: both firms would

respond to an increase in their rival's a characteris-

tic by lowering price (hence both pF / af and pf / aF are negative). This suggests that both firms have an

incentive to decrease their a characteristic level to

Conversely,

the

impact of marginal costs is large enough to make

the strategic effect dominate: both firms react to an

increase in a rival's a-characteristic level by increasing

their own price (hence both pF / af and pf / aF are

positive).

Finally,

when

,

the

and

effects exactly offset each other and changing the level

of the a characteristic has no effect on the rival's price.

The difference in the role played by characteristics A

and a in Eq is a major factor in understanding why a

Max-Min product configuration arises in equilibrium.

Furthermore, the dependence on the cost of quality

provision c will be pivotal in determining the nature

of the Max-Min equilibrium.

In the next section, we will use the results and

intuitions obtained in solving the pricing subgame to

examine how firms endogenously choose their prod-

uct characteristic levels in the first stage.

4.2. Equilibrium Choice of Product Characteristics To establish how firms position their products, we first identify all the product configurations that are locally stable, i.e., configurations in which neither firm wants to change its product positioning slightly given its competitor's product positioning. We then characterize the equilibrium among all locally stable product configurations by checking that neither firm can benefit from switching to a completely different product positioning.
The effects of a change in product characteristic qi (qi  ai Ai on firm i's profits can be decomposed using the envelope theorem as follows:

From (1) we see that there are several forces at play. First, holding rival actions constant, improvement along either characteristic increases overall product quality, which enhances the demand for such a product ( Di/ qi > 0) but at the same time makes the product more costly to produce (-cDi  0). As one effect is positive and the other is negative, what matters is the overall combined effect, which we denote the demandcost effect. We use the first-order condition (FOC) for firm i from the pricing stage to rewrite the overall demand-cost effect as

From (2), the sign of the demand-cost effect depends on the ratio of how sensitive demand is with respect to quality and with respect to price changes as compared to the cost of quality provision. We can expect the demand-cost effect to be positive when quality costs are relatively low and negative otherwise. This effect would also be relevant for a monopolist setting optimal quality levels, as we explain in §5.1.
From Lemma 2, however, we know that a modified product also has a competitive effect because a different configuration in the characteristics space affects downstream pricing decisions. This cross-price effect on profits is captured by the last term in (1). Because profits increase with the rival's price ( i/ pj > 0), the sign of the cross-price effect boils down to figuring out whether firm j increases or decreases its price when firm i improves its characteristic qi (i.e., the sign of pj / qi). Lemma 2 revealed that the crossprice effect can be positive or negative depending on the firm (F or f ) and on the characteristic (A or a).
The next two propositions establish that when quality costs are low or intermediate, any equilibrium of the game must exhibit the Max-Min property: firms always choose to maximally differentiate on

one dimension and minimally differentiate on the other dimension. Furthermore, maximal differentiation occurs on the characteristic with the greater span, with one firm selecting x¯ and the other x. Minimal differentiation occurs on the attribute with the smaller span y, and there are two possibilities that are characterized in Propositions 1 and 2.

Proposition

1.

When

the

Max-Min

config-

uration x¯ y¯ x y¯ is the unique product positioning

in equilibrium.

Proposition 1 shows that when the marginal cost of

providing quality is low, any equilibrium of the two-

characteristic game must exhibit the Max-Min prop-

erty. One firm sells the best possible product x¯ y¯ .

The rival firm fully differentiates along the charac-

teristic with the larger span and fully agglomerates

along the characteristic with the smaller span. Specif-

ically, the product configuration of the rival firm is

x y¯ .12

To understand the intuition, note that because the

marginal cost of providing greater quality is low

(c <

1 2

,

the

demand-cost

effect

is

positive.

Thus,

holding rival actions constant, firms would like to

increase product quality by offering greater attribute

levels. However, a firm may not benefit from sell-

ing a higher-quality product if subsequent price com-

petition becomes too intense, which is the case if

the cross-price effect is negative and large enough

to dominate the demand-cost effect. The sign of the

cross-price effect depends on whether the subgame

price equilibrium is Eq or Eq (see the existence con-

ditions

).

We

start

by

character-

izing locally stable product configurations that lead to

Eq in the pricing stage. From Lemma 2 we know that

in the region of Eq, where the cost of quality pro-

vision is low the cross-price effect is positive when

AF is increased and negative when Af , aF , or af are increased. Clearly then, both the demand-cost effect

and the cross-price effect push firm F to increase AF . For attribute Af however, the cross-price effect dominates; hence firm f prefers to decrease Af to relax price competition. As for the a characteristic, since

the

demand-cost

effect

is

positive

and

domi-

nates the cross-price effect for both aF and af . Hence

both firms want to increase their a characteristic to

raise demand for their product. Taken together, firms

want to maximally differentiate along the A charac-

teristic and choose the highest level on the a charac-

teristic. The locally stable product configurations that

satisfy these properties and lead to subgame equilib-

rium Eq are such that firm F sells the highest-quality

product possible x¯ y¯ , and firm f max-min differentiates by selling either x y¯ or x¯ y . In effect, either attribute x or y can serve as attribute A to form a locally stable configuration.
Another locally stable configuration may exist, one that leads to subgame equilibrium Eq. In Eq, firm F sells a dominant product with significant comparative advantages on both characteristics (see Figure 1). When a firm increases differentiation by locating further away from its rival on either attribute, price competition is relaxed per Lemma 2. The negative cross-price effect dominates the demand-cost effect for firm f on both attributes, and the two effects are positive for firm F and push it to improve quality on both attributes. Therefore, if the Max-Max product configuration is the strategy the firms play (where firms F and f choose positions x¯ y¯ and x y respectively) and the subgame pricing equilibrium is Eq, then this product configuration is also locally stable.
As is evident, in all the locally stable configurations, firm F selects the best product x¯ y¯ To characterize the global equilibrium of the game, therefore, we must determine which corner of the characteristics space firm f would choose in order to maximize its profits ( x y¯ , x¯ y , or x y ). We first compare the two Max-Min configurations. When firm f chooses the location x y¯ , its profits are 1 + c 2 x/9, and when it chooses product location x¯ y , its profits are 1 + c 2 y/9. Clearly, because characteristic x has a larger range than characteristic y ( x  y), firm f prefers maximal differentiation along characteristic x and minimal differentiation on characteristic y. In other words, firm f benefits from as much separation as possible on the attribute used for differentiation purposes, and the attribute with the greater range affords this.
Given this conclusion, what remains is to compare firm f 's profits in the Max-Min configuration x y¯ with those in the Max-Max configuration x y . Firm f essentially has to choose between serving a low-end niche market in the latter case and competing more directly with firm F by differentiating only along the x attribute in the former case. In the lowend niche strategy, firm f 's profits are low because it sells a low-quality product at a low price. Firm f prefers to go after more lucrative high-willingnessto-pay consumers with a high-quality offer on the a characteristic. Head-to-head competition on the a characteristic is less of a concern given the maximum differentiation on the A characteristic. In sum, the Max-Min equilibrium with one firm offering the best possible product is unique up to a relabeling of the firms.13 Moreover, differentiation occurs along

earns a larger profit than firm f .

We now turn to characterizing the equilibrium

whereby the demand-cost effect becomes negative. By

decreasing attribute levels, a firm may benefit more

from cost savings than it is penalized by the loss of

demand as a result of selling a lower-quality prod-

uct. The next proposition shows that, as a result, in

an intermediate quality-cost region, one firm opts to

sell the lowest quality product in equilibrium, yet the

Max-Min property continues to hold.

Proposition 2. For any y/ x, there exists a cutoff

for the quality provision cost c^ in

the Max-Min configuration x y x¯ y is the unique

product positioning in equilibrium.

Proposition 2 states that even in an intermedi-

ate quality-cost range, any equilibrium of the two-

characteristic game must still exhibit the Max-Min

property. However, in this case, one firm sells the

worst possible product x y . The rival firm fully

differentiates along the characteristic with the larger

span and fully agglomerates along the characteristic

with the smaller span. Specifically, the product con-

figuration of the rival firm is x¯ y .

The intuition behind Proposition 2, and the depen-

dence of the cutoff value c^ on the attribute ranges,

is as follows. As the demand-cost effect is now neg-

ative, firms would rather decrease their characteristic

levels. This implies that one firm always selects the

lowest-quality product in equilibrium. If the x char-

acteristic has a span much larger than the y charac-

teristic, the rival firm benefits from differentiating as

much as possible on the x characteristic to relax price

competition, but it would like to offer the lowest level

on characteristic y to contain costs (thereby selecting

the Max-Min positioning x¯ y .14 However, if the x

characteristic has a span not too much larger than the

y characteristic, there exists another configuration that

is locally stable, namely, the Max-Max configuration

( x y x¯ y¯ ). In choosing among all locally stable

configurations the positioning that generates the high-

est profit, firm F compares selling to consumers who

highly value characteristic A (Eq at x¯ y ) and selling

only to the high-end niche, i.e., consumers who highly

value both attributes (Eq at x¯ y¯ ). When c is inter-

market, and it achieves the greatest profits under the

Max-Min configuration. However, as the cost of quality provision (c) increases, firm F finds it harder and harder to stay competitive under the Max-Min configuration because its costs rise faster than the rival's costs. The need to raise prices to cover these greater costs results in a big drop in demand. If c becomes too large, firm F finds it beneficial to switch strategies, and the Max-Min equilibrium ceases to exist. In sum, the Max-Min equilibrium with one firm offering the worst product exists only when the cost of quality provision is smaller than a cutoff c^ This cutoff depends on y/ x, because the larger this ratio is, the more difficult it becomes for the firm at x¯ y to sustain this positioning--it has to incur the high costs associated with offering x¯, and at the same time, minimal differentiation along the y characteristic intensifies price competition (see Figure 2 for a graphical representation of c^).
The next proposition shows that in the region with high costs of quality provision, the Max-Min property ceases to hold as firm F achieves its greatest profits by selling to high-end consumers only.

Proposition 3. When c^ < c < 2, one firm sells the
lowest-quality product possible x y . The other firm

Not surprisingly, in the high quality-cost region, one firm selects the lowest quality product possible x y . The other firm always fully differentiates along the characteristic with the smaller span by selecting y¯, and it either fully or partially differentiates along the characteristic with the larger span. It might seem counterintuitive that when quality becomes much more expensive to provide, a firm chooses to increase its product quality by offering higher levels on all attributes. It happens because the firm with the larger comparative advantage in a Max-Min configuration finds it more and more difficult to sustain the x¯ y position when costs go up. The firm cannot raise prices to fully cover the costs of offering x¯ because of the negative impact on demand, and competition is quite intense because it offers the same low level as the rival on attribute y (the rival is able to price very aggressively given that its product is much cheaper to produce). Hence, the firm's margin and demand decrease, and at some point (when c^ < c), it finds switching to a new strategy more beneficial: the firm prefers to differentiate even more from its rival and focus mainly on the high-end niche because this alleviates price competition. To do so, the firm needs to

tioning x¯ y¯ .

Figure 2 illustrates the equilibria in Proposi-

tions 1­3. The product configuration in equilibrium

We

note

that when the cost of quality is in the intermediate

or high regions (equilibria characterized in Proposi-

tions 2 and 3), firm f always earns a greater profit

than its rival because it serves more than half of the

market and its margin is also larger per unit sold.

As indicated in Proposition 3, however, the firm

may stop shy of providing the highest quality x¯ when

the range of the x characteristic is too large. This is

because the trade-off in terms of fully differentiating

on attribute x and the cost of selecting higher quality

levels begins favoring the latter consideration. Note

then that in this case, and in contrast to the Max-Min

equilibria, the firms are maximally differentiated on

the dimension with the smaller span and partially dif-

ferentiated on the dimension with the larger span.

5. Discussion of the Model and Its Relationship to Existing Work
In this section, we come back to the assumptions of our model. We discuss in turn the benchmark case of a monopolist, the special case of marginal costs that are independent of quality, the special case of a single dimension, the difference between vertical and horizontal differentiation, how to deal with characteristics that are not symmetric, and finally, what happens when the market is not fully covered.

5.1. Benchmark Case: Monopolist When duopolists agglomerate on the y attribute (as in Propositions 1 and 2), an interesting benchmark to compare against is the level that a monopolist would select for that attribute.15 The question we ask in this section is whether a monopolist follows the same kind of strategy as the duopolists, i.e., select the highest level y¯ for low costs of quality provision (c) and then jump to the lowest level y when c is above a certain threshold.16 We show that a monopolist does not always follow this strategy: it might gradually decrease the level of y as c goes up. In effect, the monopolist's optimal strategy on the y attribute depends on how overlapping the ranges of the two attributes are. This contrasts the behavior of duopolists, whose equilibrium decisions do not depend on the degree of overlap in the ranges of the two attributes. Moreover, recall that when c is very high (c^ < c , the duopolists cease to agglomerate on the attribute with the smaller range (per Proposition 3).
Two forces are at play when a monopolist selects its optimal product quality: improving quality boosts demand for the product while it makes the production costs go up. This is what we called the demandcost effect in this paper (see (1)). When the cost of
15 We thank the associate editor for suggesting that we compare the monopolist's optimal attribute selection to that of the duopolists.
16 Because a monopolist never serves the full market, an assumption equivalent to full market coverage in the duopoly case is that V is large enough such that the monopolist serves all the consumers except the lower-end niche of customers, who do not care about quality: its market share is the full square except the bottom left corner in the x y plane (similar to F 's demand in Eq in Figure 1).

913

quality provision is low (c close to 0), the demand

effect dominates, and the monopolist selects the best

product x¯ y¯ . On the other hand, when the cost of

quality provision is high (c close to 2), the cost effect

dominates, and the monopolist selects the worst prod-

uct position x y . However, whether the monopolist

jumps abruptly from y¯ to y at some threshold value

or changes its y characteristic level gradually as a

function of c depends on the absolute levels of x and

y--specifically, on how much the range of the x char-

acteristic overlaps with the range of the y characteris-

tic. If characteristic ranges overlap substantially--for

example, have the same lower bound x = y and x¯ 

y¯--the monopolist uses a single cutoff cm in determin-

ing whether to set the highest or lowest level for the

y characteristic. In a sense, this result is similar to the

equilib-

rium is of a Max-Min type, except that the monopo-

list's

Intuitively, cost containment (-cDm) kicks in at lower

quality cost levels for the monopolist because it is the

only firm serving the market; hence Dm is closer to 1

than in the case of duopolists who split the market.17

However, if characteristic ranges differ sub-

stantially--for example, when x > y¯ (i.e., all x levels

are higher than any y level)--the monopolist changes

its y characteristic continuously as a function of c.

When c is low, the monopolist chooses the best prod-

uct because quality is not costly to produce. As c

increases, the monopolist needs to contain costs and

starts doing so by decreasing the level of its most

expensive characteristic, the x characteristic. How-

ever, once the monopolist reaches product position

x y¯ , the only way to contain costs is to start decreas-

ing the y characteristic as well. The monopolist thus

decreases its level on y continuously until it reaches

x y . To understand why the monopolist acts this

way, note that in the substantial overlapping range

case, both high-end and low-end strategies are locally

stable, and the monopolist always selects the one

generating the greater profit. A small change in c

is enough to favor one strategy at the expense of

the other, thus explaining the discontinuous jump. In

the latter case (nonoverlapping ranges), the monop-

olist has only one locally stable product location.

This product location moves continuously with the

value of c because the optimal level of y is used to

balance demand enhancement and cost containment.

These results are presented formally in the following

proposition.

5.2. Special Case: Single Dimension In the special case when firms cannot differentiate along the y attribute ( y = 0), our model is about one-dimensional vertical differentiation. Now, firms have only the x attribute to manage both the demandcost effect and the cross-price effect. Both of these effects are also behind the results in Moorthy (1988) and Shaked and Sutton (1982). Overall, Propositions 1 and 2 show that the cross-price effect is prevalent and that firms prefer to maximally differentiate: one firm selects the best product while its rival opts for the worst one.

Corollary 1. In the one-dimension case, y = 0, firms only select the level of the x attribute; when 0  c < 2, the Max differentiation configuration x¯ x is the unique product positioning in equilibrium.

When comparing the two-dimension case with the single-dimension case, one can think of the attribute with the larger range as playing the same role as the single dimension. Firms differentiate along x in order to relax price competition. They actually maximally differentiate along that attribute as long as it is not too costly to do so. Interestingly, the role of the second attribute is different. The prime concern of firms when choosing their y characteristic level is not price competition but demand stimulation or cost containment. In the low quality-cost region, firms use the smaller range attribute y to boost demand by choosing the highest quality level possible. In the intermediate quality-cost region, firms choose the lowest quality level possible to contain cost. Finally, in the high quality-cost region, one firm selects the lowest quality level to contain cost while its rival selects the highest level to target the niche of high-end consumers. In the two-dimensional case, by having two characteristics to work with, firms select one dimension to differentiate on and mitigate price competition and the other dimension to manage demand and cost considerations.

5.3. Special Case: Marginal Costs Independent of Attribute Levels Chosen
We now discuss the special case when marginal costs are independent of attribute levels (c = 0), which is covered by our results in Proposition 1. In that

Lauga and Ofek: Product Positioning in a Two-Dimensional Vertical Differentiation Model

case, our model boils down to the setup in Vandenbosch and Weinberg (1995) (VW hereafter) but our conclusions regarding the equilibrium product configuration are not the same. We find the exact same prices and profits in the pricing stage as in VW, although we organize these results in a slightly different way. However, our Proposition 1 unequivocally states that when c = 0, the only equilibrium possible entails the Max-Min configuration. By contrast, VW propose several equilibria that do not satisfy the MaxMin property. To understand why the Max-Max and Partial-Max configurations proposed in VW cannot form an equilibrium when c = 0, start with either of these product configurations and note that both entail one firm selling the best product x¯ y¯ . The rival can then deviate to x y¯ and boost its demand by choosing the highest level of the smaller range attribute while keeping competition relaxed by maximally differentiating along the attribute with the larger span. Interested readers can refer to Appendix A for details of the profitable deviation for firm f . In the end, only the Max-Min configuration of Proposition 1 is sustainable in equilibrium. VW's conclusion that other product configurations could form an equilibrium stems from an error in the sign of certain profit derivatives with respect to product characteristics (specifically, in VW's Table 1, region dR2x contains sign errors that can lead to erroneous equilibrium conclusions).
We wish to note that the Max-Max and PartialMax equilibria we characterize in Proposition 3 are the result of firms also taking into consideration greater costs in providing higher levels of product attributes--an issue that is not part of the VW model.

5.4. Vertical vs. Horizontal Differentiation

Our paper analyzes the case of two vertically differ-

entiated characteristics: all consumers prefer higher

characteristic levels but differ in their willingness to

pay for higher quality. How do our conclusions relate

to those of Neven and Thisse (1990), who study the

case of one vertically and one horizontally differen-

tiated characteristic? The horizontally differentiated

characteristic is interpreted as variety instead of qual-

ity because consumers disagree on their preferred

characteristic level keeping prices fixed. Because it is

not clear why one variety would be more expensive

to produce than another one, and consistent with the

model assumptions of Neven and Thisse (1990), we

assume in this discussion that marginal costs are inde-

pendent of product positioning (c = 0). In Neven and

Thisse (1990), a monopolist would choose the highest

quality

level

(q¯)

and

the

central

variety

(

1 2

),

whereas

in our model, a monopolist chooses the top qualities

(x¯ and y¯). Hence, the central variety location plays a

similar role as the highest quality level on an attribute

in our model.

Under duopolistic competition, Neven and Thisse

(1990) identify two equilibria that satisfy the Max-

Min property.18 In one equilibrium, firms maximally

differentiate along the quality characteristic (one firm

chooses q¯, and the other chooses q) and agglomer-

ate

on

variety

(both

locating

at

1 2

).

In

the

other

equi-

librium, firms agglomerate on quality (both locating

at q¯) and maximally differentiate along the variety

dimension (one firm chooses to locate at 0, and the other chooses to locate at 1). Note that in both our

paper and theirs, firms always agglomerate on the

attribute level that would be chosen by a monopolist.

However, when in Neven and Thisse (1990) differenti-

ation occurs on the horizontal dimension, neither firm

locates in the center, and the "best" product

q¯

1 2

,

which would be chosen by a monopolist, is not cho-

sen in equilibrium. By contrast, in our paper the best

product x¯ y¯ is always selected by one of the firms

when c = 0. Another difference relates to uniqueness.

Neven and Thisse (1990) show that both equilibria

can coexist, whereas we find that the equilibrium is

unique as firms always maximally differentiate along

the larger range characteristic. Finally, both papers

show that the Max-Max configuration cannot form an

equilibrium when c = 0.

5.5. Other Model Assumptions Revisited
5.5.1. Attribute Roles and Preference Parameters. In our model, the two characteristics play a symmetric role in the utility of consumers V + xx + yy - p, with x and y uniformly distributed over 0 1 . This setup is not as restrictive as it seems and, in fact, encompasses more-general cases. Let us examine two examples with characteristics that are not symmetric in the case when c = 0. First, one characteristic could play a more important role than the other, which can be modeled by having different weights in the utility function such as V + xx + yy - p. If the weight is larger than 1, characteristic y is more important than characteristic x, and if is smaller than 1, the reverse is true. We can transform the above setup to conform to the model studied in this paper by rescaling the y characteristic. Specifically, by defining y = y in
y y¯ and letting firms select x in x x¯ and y in y y¯ , we can compare the ranges of the characteristics ( x and y) to identify the product positioning equilibrium in analogy to the analysis presented in this paper. The second issue around symmetry deals with taste parameters x and y that do not have the same range. As long as these taste parameters are uniformly distributed over 0 x and 0 y , respectively, we can rescale both the characteristic levels and

18 Neven and Thisse (1990) do not establish that these Max-Min equilibria are the only possible equilibria.

915

the taste parameters so that Propositions 1­3 apply. Specifically, we define x = x/ x, y = y/ y, x =
xx, and y = yy so that consumers' utility becomes V + xx + yy - p, with x and y uniformly distributed over 0 1 . In the end, rescaling the characteristics so that they play a symmetric role in the utility function allows us to compare their ranges to be able to talk about the larger range and smaller range characteristics.
Rescaling the characteristics also changes the marginal cost, which becomes cxx + cyy with cx = cy. In general, when the cost parameters differ for each of the attributes, our results qualitatively hold with a few caveats. When both costs are small, similar to Proposition 1, the product location equilibrium will exhibit the Max-Min property with one firm selling product x¯ y¯ and the rival selling product x y¯ . Yet if, for example, the cost parameter cy increases substantially while cx remains constant, firms will switch to the Max-Min equilibrium described in Proposition 2 to contain costs (although the threshold could be less than 1/2). As cy keeps increasing, both firms are affected in the same way (as both select the same minimal level of y), so firm F may not switch to the niche Max-Max configuration described in Proposition 3. Similarly, in the case of increasing cx while keeping cy constant, firms might not switch from the Max-Min configuration with both selecting y¯ to the Max-Min configuration with both selecting y because
now reducing the level of the x characteristic helps more in terms of cost containment.
5.5.2. Full Market Coverage. Throughout this paper we assume that the market is fully served. The value V of the product is large enough so that all consumers buy in equilibrium. We now discuss what happens if we relax the full market coverage assumption when marginal costs are independent of quality (c = 0). When V  max x/3 3 y/8 , for any product configuration the market is fully covered. In that case, Proposition 1 shows that the Max-Min property holds in equilibrium, that firms fully differentiate along the larger range attribute, and that both firms choose the highest quality level for the smaller range attribute. When V < max x/3 3 y/8 , the market will not be fully covered in equilibrium. In this case, firm f cares not only about losing consumers to its rival, in which case only the relative quality levels A and a matter, but also about having consumers opting out of the market because they do not derive positive utility. Hence the absolute levels of af and Af now also play an important role, and firm f may not want to offer the lowest possible level on attribute x so that it can create sufficient demand. We show in the electronic companion (available as part of the online version that can be found at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org/) that as long as x and y are not too small, the unique

equilibrium will have the market not fully served, and as in Proposition 1, one firm selects the best product possible (x¯ y¯) and firms agglomerate along the smaller range attribute by choosing the highest level y¯. The only difference is that differentiation along the larger range attribute will not necessarily be maximal. In particular, when x is not large enough, firms might only partially differentiate on the x characteristic. But note that even though the market is not fully covered, the nature of the equilibrium--using only the larger span attribute to differentiate on while electing to be undifferentiated on the smaller span attribute--still holds.
6. Managerial Implications and Concluding Remarks
When products comprise multiple characteristics, firms have considerable flexibility with respect to how they position their offerings in the marketplace. In a duopoly model in which consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their willingness to pay for each of two product characteristics, we uncover an interesting interplay between the desire to differentiate in order to manage competition on the one hand and the need to contain the costs of delivering greater quality on the other hand.
A central result we obtain is that when the marginal cost of quality provision is not too high, firms will always choose to maximally differentiate on one dimension and minimally differentiate on the other, thereby ruling out equilibria that do not satisfy the Max-Min property. Furthermore, we show that differentiation should always occur along the attribute with the greater range.
Our results also provide clarity on what level the firms should provide on the nondifferentiated attribute (y . Specifically, when the marginal cost of quality provision is low, demand generation is a key consideration, and both firms should offer the highest possible attribute level. Conversely, when the cost of quality provision is intermediate, containing costs becomes a nontrivial concern, and both firms should offer the lowest possible attribute level.
We then show that the Max-Min property breaks down as the cost of quality provision increases further. Interestingly though, the higher costs prompt firms to become even more differentiated: one firm chooses a product with minimal levels on both product dimensions while its rival chooses maximal levels (a Max-Max equilibrium). The firm offering the highest qualities serves a small niche of consumers that value high-end products and charges them a high price. Given this high-end strategy, the rival firm offering the low-quality product does not have to price too aggressively and can have a sizable margin.

Our findings have important managerial implications for firms considering how to position their product in light of competition. One option firms often contemplate is to try to outdo rivals by offering a product that excels on all dimensions. Our findings suggest that a firm should consider such an approach only if (a) the marginal costs associated with increasing quality are low enough, and the rival is expected to offer a low level on the attribute with the larger span; or (b) the marginal costs associated with increasing quality are actually high, and the rival is expected to position at the low end on both attributes. Examined from the opposite perspective, when a firm faces a rival that is expected to choose high quality levels on both product attributes, then it makes sense to fully differentiate on all dimensions when the costs of quality provision are high but only differentiate on one dimension when those costs are low. Firms should also be aware of the fact that in case (a), the highest-quality product is also the most profitable, whereas in case (b), the lowest-quality product is the most profitable.19
Second, our findings indicate that as long as marginal quality costs are not too high, firms need to first understand which product attribute has the greatest range (in terms of the relevant levels consumers care about or the feasible range of development and/or production). After converting both attributes to a common utility scale, it is the dimension with the greater range that should serve for differentiation purposes.
Several of our findings may be relevant for empirical work that examines competitive differentiation. In particular, given that for a wide range of quality provision costs we should expect Max-Min equilibria, future work could test whether the degree of product differentiation among firms in a given market tends to be selectively greater around one attribute with less variance around the choice of other attributes (a percent difference from a baseline or some other mean-centering technique can be used to compare differentiation across each of the attributes). In addition, and consistent with our conditions for the MaxMax equilibrium, one can test whether industries that exhibit relatively high quality costs tend to exhibit more overall differentiation. To do so, one could create an index that accounts for differentiation on more than one dimension (say, an average differentiation measure across all attributes) and an estimate of the variable costs associated with quality provision (see, for example, Srinivasan et al. 1997, Horsky and
19 These implications could also be relevant for an entrant given the product positioning chosen by an incumbent already in the market. Of course, such conclusions would require solving a sequential move game to verify the nature of the equilibria.

Nelson 1992, for proposed techniques to do so); one further needs to devise a way to compare cost levels across industries. Alternatively, in industries where there was a significant change in the cost of quality provision, for example, because of an increase in the cost of inputs, one can look at how firms within the industry adjusted their product locations subsequent to the cost shock (looking for a positive correlation between variable cost changes and degree of overall differentiation). We note that because our model captures vertical differentiation, it would be relevant to look at industries where product attributes, and consumer heterogeneity, conform to this setup. Many high-tech markets--for example, microprocessors or graphics cards--could be appropriate for such an examination (noting also that in these particular cases we have duopolistic competition).
As with much of the literature in this stream, our analysis and findings come with a few caveats. First, we have assumed that variable costs linearly rise with attribute levels. In reality, higher-quality products may be increasingly more costly to produce, i.e., exhibit a convex quality-to-cost relationship (see Moorthy 1988 for an analysis of a one-dimensional case). Costs may also include some interaction terms between the two attribute levels; e.g., raising one attribute would be increasingly costly as the level of the other attribute goes up. In either case, we believe our results would hold for at least some cost regions, although we would expect the Max-Min equilibrium to cease existing sooner because costs increase faster than in the linear case. Second, choosing attribute levels often requires up-front fixed investments in research and development, which we have ignored. However, because up-front costs are incurred once and do not depend on volume sold, we expect our results to be less affected by them qualitatively. We leave the examination of these alternative cost structures for future research. Third, our analysis assumed uniformly distributed preferences for both attributes. In reality, consumer preferences may exhibit different distributions, which would likely affect the most lucrative product locations (see, e.g., Ansari et al. 1994). Fourth, we have assumed that the contribution of the two attributes to consumer utility is additive, in line with much of the work on multiattribute preferences (Green and Srinivasan 1990). Yet it is conceivable that in some settings, the contribution is multiplicative, particularly when the two attributes are complementary. This could lead to different conclusions than the ones reached here and is an area for future exploration. Fifth, it would be useful to examine whether the findings reported here extend to the case of more than two characteristics--in particular, whether we should expect the equilibrium when the cost of quality provision is not too high to

917

exhibit maximal differentiation on only one attribute and minimal differentiation on all others. Finally, in some contexts firms may seek to design more than one offering, which introduces product line considerations. Although we expect the forces identified here to still be relevant, each firm would also need to manage cannibalization concerns. Future research could examine whether the configurations identified in this paper still emerge in equilibrium, with firms adding products to occupy additional positions in the space, or whether entirely new positions emerge that are not predominantly at the corners of the x - y space.

Appendix A. Profitable Deviations from Max-Max

and Partial-Max Configurations When c = 0

When marginal cost is equal to 0 (c = 0), our model setup

boils down to the setup in VW. We provide below profitable

deviations to show that certain product configurations sug-

gested in VW cannot be part of an equilibrium.

First,

VW

claim

that,

if

128 81

y

x  2 y, there

exists a Max-Max equilibrium in which firm 2 is positioned

at x¯ y¯ , and firm 1 positions at x y . If firm 1 chooses

a Max-Max configuration by locating at x y , its profits

are

1 4

x y/8 (see Eq in our Table 2 or VW's Table 1).

However, if firm 1 chooses instead a Max-Min configuration

by positioning at x y¯ , its profits are x/9 (see Eq in our

Table 2 or VW's Table 1). Firm 1 would never choose the

product positioning with the lower profit. As

x/9

when

128 81

y

x, firm 1 never chooses

1 4
x

x y

y/8 < imply-

ing that x¯ y¯ x y cannot be an equilibrium.

Second, VW also claim that if 2 y  x, there exists a

Partial-Max equilibrium in which firm 2 is positioned at

x¯ y¯ , and firm 1 positions at x¯ - 2 y y . If firm 1 chooses

x¯ - 2 y y , its profits are y/8 (see Eq in our Table 2 or

VW's Table 1). However, if firm 1 chooses x y¯ instead, its

profits are x/9 (see Eq in our Table 2 or VW's Table 1),

which are greater than y/8 as 2 y  x. Hence, firm 1

has a profitable deviation, and x¯ y¯ x¯ - 2 y y is not

an equilibrium.

We show in the proof of Proposition 1 that x¯ y¯ x y¯

is the only product configuration in equilibrium.

Appendix B. Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1. The profits are simply F = DF pF - c aF + AF and f = Df pf - c af + Af , where Df and DF are the demand of firms f and F , respectively. A consumer buys from firm F iff A  pF - pf / A - a a/ A. Thus in the A a plane, the indifferent consumers are represented by an indifference line that is increasing in the asymmetric characteristics case and decreasing in the dominant product case.
The assumptions of Propositions 15 and 6 in Caplin and Nalebuff (1991) are satisfied. Hence, the equilibrium is unique, and if a price vector pF , pf satisfies all the FOCs,

it is a Nash equilibrium. In the rest of this proof, we look
for prices solving the FOCs.
We first analyze the case when all consumers with A = 0 buy product f and all consumers with A = 1 buy product F ; i.e., max 0 a  pF - pf  A + min 0 a . This case corresponds to the top left graph in Figure B.1. The demand
for firm f is Df = pF - pf / A - a/ 2 A . The demand for firm F is DF = 1 - Df . The FOCs F / pF = 0 f / pf = 0 are equivalent to

a 2pF = pf + A + 2 + c aF + AF and
a 2pf = pF - 2 + c af + cAf
Solving for prices leads to

2-c pF - c aF + AF =

A+

1 2

-

c

a

and

1+c pf - c af + Af =

A+

c

-

a

Finally, we check that max 0 a  pF - pf  A + min 0 a is satisfied iff A + a = 0 or (c  2 and 2 a -
A  c A + a  2 A - a).
Second, we analyze the case when consumers buy prod-
uct f only if they have a low willingness to pay for quality
in both dimensions; i.e., 0  pF - pf  a. This case corresponds to the top right graph in Figure B.1. The demand for firm f is Df = pF - pf2 / 2 A a . The demand for firm F is DF = 1 - Df . Let us define X = pf - c af + Af . The FOCs F / pF = 0 f / pf = 0 are equivalent to 8X2 - 2Xc A + a - a A = 0 and pF - pf = 2X. The FOCs are satisfied iff

pF - c aF + AF = 3X - c A + a and

c pf - c af + Af =

A+ a +

c2 A + a 2 + 8 a A 8

Furthermore, 0  pF - pf  a is true iff c A + a  2 a - A.
Third, we analyze the case when consumers buy product
F only if they have a high willingness to pay for quality in
both dimensions; i.e., A  pF - pf  a + A ( a > 0 dominant product case). This case corresponds to the bottom
right graph in Figure B.1. The demand for firm f is Df = 1 - a + A - pF - pf 2 / 2 a A . The demand for firm F is DF = a + A - pF - pf 2 / 2 a A . Let us define X = pF - c aF + AF . The FOCs F / pF = 0 f / pf = 0 are equivalent to pF - pf = a + A - 2X and 8X2 + 2X c - 1 a + A - a A = 0. The FOCs are satisfied iff

pF - c aF + AF

1-c =

A+ a +

1 - c 2 A + a 2 + 8 a A and 8

pf - c af + Af = 3X + c - 1 A + a

Furthermore, A  pF - pf  a + A is true iff a > 0 and c A + a  2 A - a.
Fourth, we analyze the case when consumers buy prod-
uct F only if they have a high willingness to pay for the

characteristic; i.e., a + A  pF - pf  A. This case corresponds to the bottom left graph in Figure B.1. The demand for firm f is Df = 1 - A - pF - pf 2/ -2 a A . The demand for firm F is DF = A - pF - pf 2/ -2 a A . Let us define X = pF - c aF + AF . The FOCs F / pF = 0
f / pf = 0 are equivalent to pF - pf = A - 2X and 8X2 + 2X c - 1 A + c a + a A = 0. The FOCs are satisfied iff

pF - c aF + AF

- c-1 A-c a+ =

c - 1 A + c a 2 - 8 a A and 8

pf - c af + Af = 3X + c - 1 A + c a

Furthermore, a + A  pF - pf  A is true iff a < 0 and c  2.
Finally, we double-checked the last case ( A +
min 0 a  pF - pf ), and as expected, these prices cannot form an equilibrium.
Therefore, we have characterized the unique Nash equilibrium in prices.20

20 Note that at the limit between several regions, all the equilibria lead to the same prices and demands.

Proof of Proposition 1 (Max-Min Equilibrium with Best Product). Per the previous lemma, firm F has to sell the best product in equilibrium; otherwise, it could increase its profit by increasing the level of any of its characteristics. We now look at the best response of a firm when its rival sells the best product. This firm is necessarily firm f in equilibrium, and according to the previous lemma, firm f 's best response is also to locate at a corner of the product space. Hence, x¯ y and x y¯ are always local maxima of firm f 's profit function. Using a symmetry argument, firm f earns the same profit by locating at x¯ y or at x¯ - y y¯ , as in both cases A = y and a = 0. We know that firm f strictly prefers x y¯ over x¯ - y y¯ , and therefore firm f prefers to position at x¯ y to x y¯ .21 If c x + y < 2 y - x, x y is also a local maximum of firm f 's profit

21 To be fully precise, if x = y, firm f is indifferent between x¯ y and x y¯ .

In the end, x y¯ is firm f 's best response because it is the global maximum of firm f 's profit function.
We need to check now that if the rival firm selects x y¯ , a firm's best response is to choose the best product. Depending on its product positioning, this firm can either be firm f or firm F . In either case, however, a < 0, implying that
/ a > 0. Hence the profit function has only one local maximum x¯ y¯ , which is the best response. Finally, the unique equilibrium--up to relabeling the firms--is x¯ y¯ and x y¯ .22

Remark. In equilibrium, firms split the market based on

how much consumers value characteristic A. The demand

of firm f

Proof. If the rival firm positions on the worst product, the firm is necessarily firm F . If c x + y > 2 x - y, positioning at x¯ y¯ implies that Eq occurs. However, if firm F chooses x¯ y , then Eq happens. Therefore

Proof of Proposition 2 (Max-Min Equilibrium with

Worst

Product).

When

1 2

< c < 2,

Eq

or

Eq

occurs.

In

equilibrium, firm f has to sell the worst product; otherwise,

per Lemmas 4 and 5, it could increase its profit by decreas-

ing the level of any of its characteristics. We now look at

the best response of a firm when its rival sells the worst

product. This firm is necessarily firm F in equilibrium, and

according to Lemmas 4 and 5, x¯ y and x y¯ are always

local maxima of firm F 's profit function. Firm F earns the

same profit by locating at x y¯ or x + y y , as in both

cases A = y and a = 0. We know that firm F strictly

prefers x¯ y over x + y y , and therefore firm F prefers

to position at x¯ y to x y¯ .23

(i) If c x + y > 2 x - y and { x/2  y or ( x/2 >

y and c  1 + 2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y , x¯ y¯ is

the only other local maximum of firm F 's profit function.

Per Lemma 6, x¯ y is firm F 's best response (global maxi-

mum

of

firm

F 's

profit

function)

when

1 2

< c < c^.

(ii) If c x + y > 2 x - y, x/2 > y and c > 1 +

2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y , x y¯ is the only other

local maximum of firm F 's profit function. Per Lemma 7,

x¯ y is firm F 's best response (global maximum of firm F 's

profit

function)

when

1 2

< c < c^.

We need to check now that if the rival firm selects x¯ y , a

firm's best response is to choose the worst product. Depend-

ing on its product positioning, this firm can be either firm f

or firm F . In either case, however, a < 0, implying that

/ a < 0. Hence the profit function has only one local

maximum x y , which is the best response. Finally, the

unique equilibrium up to relabeling the firms is x y and

x¯ y .24

Proof of Proposition 3. The first paragraph of the proof of Proposition 2 is still valid.
(i) If c x + y > 2 x - y and { x/2  y or ( x/2 > y and c  1 + 2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y )}, x¯ y¯ is the only other local maximum of firm F 's profit function. Per Lemma 6, x¯ y¯ is firm F 's best response (global maximum of firm F 's profit function) when c^ < c < min 2 2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y + 1 . We need to check now that if the rival firm selects x¯ y¯ , a firm's best response is to choose the worst product. Whatever its product positioning, this firm is firm f , implying that f / qf < 0. Hence the profit function has only one local maximum x y , which is the best response. Finally, the unique equilibrium up to relabeling the firms is x y and x¯ y¯ . (ii) If c x + y > 2 x - y, x/2 > y and c > 1 + 2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y , x y¯ is the only other local maximum of firm F 's profit function. Per Lemma 7, x y¯ is firm F 's best response (global maximum of firm F 's profit function) when max c^ 2 x y/ 2 x - y x - 2 y + 1 < c < 2. We need to check now that if the rival firm selects x y¯ , the firm's best response is to choose the worst product. Depending on its product positioning, this firm can be either firm

23 To be fully precise, if x = y, firm F is indifferent between x¯ y and x y¯ .
24 Once again, if x = y, another equilibrium exists, which is x y and x y¯ , because no attribute has a strictly larger span.

of the profit function. And if

x¯ y is also a local maximum of the profit function.25 There

Therefore even when x¯ y is a local maximum of the profit function, the best response when the rival selects x y¯ is always x y . Finally, the unique equilibrium up to relabeling the firms is x y and x y¯ .

Proof of Proposition 4. When V  3 max x¯ y¯ + min x¯ y¯ /2 and c  2 the monopolist chooses

pm = V + - V - cx - cy +

V - cx - cy 2 + 6xy 3

and its demand is Dm = 1 - pm - V 2/ 2xy . Using the envelope theorem and plugging in the FOC, we get

m
x = pm - cx - cy

Dm D c p+ x

Thus, m/ x > 0  pm - V > 2cx  y > 6c2x + 2c V - cx - cy  y > 4c2x + 2cV / 1 + 2c2 (1). Similarly, we get
m/ y = pm - cx - cy pm - V / xy2 -cy + pm - V /2 and m/ y > 0  x > 6c2y + 2c V - cx - cy  y >
1 + 2c2 x - 2cV / 4c2 (2) When c  1/2, the condition on V ensures that m/ x < 0 and m/ y < 0. When c < 1/2,
conditions (1) and (2) split the (x y) plane into four regions: m/ x and m/ y both positive, both negative, or one
negative and one positive. Let c^ < 1/2 be such that (1) and
(2) hold with equality when y = y¯, c0 < 1/2 be such that (2) holds with equality when x y = x y¯ , and c1 < 1/2 be such that (2) holds with equality when x y = x y .

25 x is defined in the proof of Lemma 7. 26 c  c^ and c^  2 x - y / x + y = x  1 + c / 2 - c y.

Case x = y and x¯  y¯: A carefully analysis of all the signs of m/ x and m/ y shows that there exists cm  c1 c^ such that the monopolist chooses y¯ if c < cm and y if cm  c  2. Using a continuity argument, the threshold strategy must also hold when x  y and x¯  y¯.
Case x > y¯: Note that when c  c^, m/ y > 0; and when c  c^, m/ x < 0. Thus when c < c0, the monopolist chooses y¯; when c0 < c < c1, the monopolist chooses ycm such that condition (2) holds at x ycm (i.e., ycm > 1 + 2c2 x - 2cV / 4c2 ); and when c1 < c, the monopolist chooses y.
