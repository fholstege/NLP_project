Pooling and Dynamic Forgetting Effects in Multitheme Advertising: Tracking the Advertising Sales Relationship with Particle Filters

Firms often use a pool or series of advertising themes in their campaigns. Thus, for example, a firm may employ some of its advertising to promote price-related themes or messages and other of its advertising to promote product-related themes. This study examines the interdependence that can occur between pairs of themes in a pool (i.e., pooling effects), the impact of these pooling effects on the allocation of advertising expenditures, and the factors that can affect forgetting rates (or, conversely, carry-over rates) in a multitheme advertising environment. The study measures pooling, wear out, and forgetting (carry-over) effects for a campaign that uses five different advertising themes. To obtain these measures, I extend the linear Nerlove-Arrow (NA) (1962) model to a nonlinear model of advertising theme quality and goodwill and estimate the extended model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and particle filtering ideas. Particle filtering belongs to a class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods designed to estimate nonlinear/nonnormal state space models. Results show that forgetting (or carry-over) rates may be time varying and a function of prior goodwill (past advertising) and other advertising variables. Results show, moreover, that pooling effects can reduce theme wear out and, in turn, significantly improve advertising efficiency.

1. Introduction
Firms often employ a pool or variety of advertising themes (for example, price and product ad themes) in their campaigns (Rossiter and Percy 1997). Although airing such themes concurrently can reduce theme effectiveness or quality because of interference (Kent 1991, Kent and Allen 1993, Kumar 2000, Kumar and Krishnan 2004), ad themes in a pool could, in fact, improve each other's quality if, for example, the firm alternates the themes that are aired over time (Grass and Wallace 1969). Thus, if price and product ads in a pool are aired alternately, the quality of the price ad could plausibly improve the quality of the product ad and vice versa. This interdependence between pairs of themes (or "pooling effects") could in principle forestall advertising quality wear out (Naik et al. 1998), and, in turn, improve ad theme efficiency.
Yet, ad efficiency is not only the result of wear out dynamics; it is more generally the result of the carry-over effects from past advertising. Thus carryover effects, their magnitudes, and rates of decay over time have been the subject of numerous econometric studies (Bass and Clarke 1972, Clarke 1976, Hanssens

et al. 1990). These studies traditionally employed linear distributed lag models in which the carry over rate (or, conversely, the forgetting rate) was a constant parameter, unaffected by changing factors in the advertising environment. Yet, despite the longevity of this econometric assumption, it appears that forgetting rates could indeed be time varying (Gensch and Welam 1973, Blattberg and Jeuland 1981), with past advertising (prior goodwill), competitive advertising, and copy theme all affecting the rates at which advertising decays (Ray et al. 1971) over time. It seems reasonable then to suggest that multitheme studies should also consider these dynamic features of advertising decay.
This study thus explores pooling effects and factors that could affect the rates at which advertising decays over time in a multitheme context. As a result, the substantive questions relevant to this study are as follows: How variable are the carry-over effects of different themes? How do goodwill, the result of past ad spending, and ad themes affect forgetting rates? In addition, prior research posits that stopping an ad theme or varying the executions of the same basic

ad theme can forestall its wear out (Naik et al. 1998, Grass and Wallace 1969). What are, however, the differential effects of pooling and varying ad themes on the quality of each theme? Finally, what is the impact of pooling effects on the allocation of resources across themes?
This work builds on and extends the recent effort of Bass et al. (2007). These researchers proposed a linear model that linked demand to weekly ad spending, incurred in airing different themes. Their study extended (Naik et al. 1998) to measure the wear-out effects of different themes, and the implications of wear out on a firm's advertising budget. Their model, estimated using Kalman filtering and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ideas, found that airing themes concurrently resulted in negative effects (Kent 1991, Kent and Allen 1993). The Bass et al. (2007) study, though, has several features that limit its generality. First, it models the advertising forgetting rate as a constant parameter, probably biasing the carry-over effects of past advertising on current demand. Second, it ignores the significant benefits of pooling effects as previously described. Third, while it is interesting to discover that airing themes concurrently could lead to negative effects, this result alone seems inadequate to explain why advertisers would pool themes in the first place. In contrast to Bass et al. (2007), this study (see Table 1) estimates a flexible model of forgetting effects, and captures, along with wear out, the effects ad themes in a pool may have on each other's quality (i.e., pooling effects). Furthermore, the response model in this study is both dynamic and nonlinear, and therefore it is estimated using a combination of particle filtering and MCMC procedures (cf. Doucet et al. 2001, Ristic et al. 2004, Liu and Chen 1998). Particle filtering is a flexible Bayesian inference method used to estimate nonlinear/nonnormal dynamic systems.
In summary, this paper contributes to the advertising response literature in several ways. First, it introduces a dynamic model to investigate several factors that could affect the rate at which advertising decays over time, and the magnitude of carry-over effects for different themes. Although analytical and experimental studies have considered some of these factors, to

the best of my knowledge, they have not been investigated empirically either in a model that links advertising expenditures to sales, or in a multitheme context. Second, the paper examines the benefits that could arise because of the pooling and varying of multiple themes, and it considers the impact of these pooling effects on the firm's ad budgeting decisions. Evidence supporting the use of theme variation to diminish or forestall wear out emerges from several prior experimental studies (e.g., Schumann et al. 1990). Still, this paper is probably one of the first to consider pooling and theme variation in a market-based model of sales. Third, to estimate the resulting model, the paper introduces a Bayesian nonlinear/nonnormal filter, the particle filter. The method generalizes the Kalman filter/smoother algorithm for Bayesian dynamic linear models (DLMs) (Van Heerde et al. 2004, Liechty et al. 2005), and may open up opportunities for ad tracking, diffusion, and other marketing studies where microdynamics and nonlinear features might be important (e.g., eye tracking studies, Pieters and Wedel 2000, Pieters et al. 1999). Results show that advertising may be more efficient in the presence of pooling effects; and pooling effects may help reduce the negative effects of wear out and airing themes concurrently, providing some justification for why firms would pool messages. Results show, too, that advertising decay might be not only a function of when an ad is shown (Thaivanich et al. 2000) but also a function of prior goodwill and other advertising variables. This, in turn, implies that there might not be a single decay function for past advertising (see Clarke 1976), but a family of such functions (see Ray et al. 1971, p. 14). Finally, the proposed model is shown to be superior to Bass et al. (2007) in terms of numerical measures of fit and forecast performance.
The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the relevant streams in the advertising content and dynamic effects literatures. Section 3 develops the theoretical model. Section 4 presents details of the econometric model and the data. The data come from a major telecom provider, a monopolist in its category. The firm classifies its advertising into five themes: price offer ads, product offer ads, call stimulation ads, reconnect ads, and reassurance ads. Subsequently, §5 presents the results of the estimation and the implications of these results on theme carry over and ad budget decisions. The paper concludes with an overview of the findings, managerial implications, and limitations of the study.
2. Literature Review
This study draws on several streams within the advertising content and dynamic effects literature that have investigated: (i) quality dynamics and theme effects,

Bruce: Pooling and Dynamic Forgetting Effects in Multitheme Advertising

Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 659­673, © 2008 INFORMS

661

(ii) time-varying forgetting or carry-over rates, and (iii) theme variation. What follows is a brief review of these relevant streams. For an extensive review, the reader should see, for example, Little (1979), Vakratsas and Ambler (1999), Tellis (2004), and Vakratsas (2005), and the references therein.
2.1. Quality Dynamics and Theme Effects Several prior studies support the view that advertising effectiveness or quality should vary over time and across advertising themes. For example, Little (1979) argued that ad effects should vary because of changes in media and copy. Naik et al. (1998), however, in a definitive study, demonstrated that ad quality could regenerate during periods of no advertising because of forgetting, and could decline during periods of continuous advertising because of wear out (Grass and Wallace 1969, Greenberg and Suttoni 1973, Pechmann and Stewart 1990). These researchers (Naik et al. 1998) modeled two sources of wear out: copy wear out, which occurs because of the passage of time, regardless of the level of ad spending; and repetition wear out, which occurs because of the excessive levels of ad spending. Bass et al. (2007) extended Naik et al. (1998) to account for the wear-out effects and quality of different advertising themes. In a model of constant forgetting rate and no pooling effects, they found that airing themes concurrently resulted in negative effects, perhaps because of clutter; and support for the premise that emotional ad themes wear out faster than nonemotional themes (MacInnis et al. 2002). Similarly, in a market-level study of the effects of various ad appeals, Chandy et al. (2001) found that argumentbased appeals (or themes) were more effective in new markets, whereas emotion-based appeals were more effective in mature markets.
2.2. Time-Varying Forgetting Rates Econometric models of advertising have traditionally assumed that advertising has two effects on demand: an instantaneous effect because of current expenditures, and a carry-over effect because of prior expenditures or goodwill.1 Moreover, the effects of prior expenditures (i.e., carry over), the result of delayed response or repeat behavior (Tellis et al. 2000), were often discounted at some constant forgetting (carryover) rate (cf. Bass and Clarke 1972, Clarke 1976, Hanssens et al. 1990).2 While a constant rate might simplify model estimation, such a rate is unrelated
1 See, for example, Thaivanich et al. (2000) and Pechmann and Stewart (1990) for the behavioral justification for this assumption.
2 The single exponential decay function implied by these models (and similar linear distributed lag forms, e.g., Mitra and Golder 2006) varies with the inclusion of additional lagged values in dependent measure, and additional lagged advertising (independent) terms (Clarke 1976). However, the carry-over parameters remain constant, unrelated to changing advertising variables.

to changing factors in the advertising environment, and thus is probably unrealistic (Bultez and Naert 1979, Pechmann and Stewart 1990, Chessa and Murre 2007). For example, Ray et al. (1971), drawing on several experimental studies, concluded that copy theme, brand awareness, and competitive advertising could all shape advertising decay. In addition, Gensch and Welam (1973) showed analytically that a fixed carryover rate could be inconsistent with learning and forgetting theory (Chessa and Murre 2007). That is, using a Nerlove-Arrow-type (1962) formulation, their study demonstrated that the effect on demand in any given period, of advertising in the same period, might be independent of the levels of advertising in all prior periods. In a solution to this inconsistency, the authors modeled carry over as a function of prior goodwill, with the duration of carry over influenced by the intensity of competitive advertising. The carryover (forgetting) rate was hypothesized to decrease (increase) with competition, and increase (decrease) with goodwill but at a decreasing (increasing) rate. Similarly, Blattberg and Jeuland (1981) proposed a micromodel, and aggregated across consumers and over time to produce a macromodel of the ad-sales relationship. The resulting model found analytically that the carry-over rate was not constant, but varied nonlinearly over time with prior ad spending, as hypothesized earlier in Gensch and Welam (1973).
This hypothesized impact of prior goodwill on the rate of advertising decay is a particularly appealing model feature. It suggests that the probability of carry over effects (from repeat or delayed purchases) increases with cumulative prior ad spending, but at a diminishing rate. This is consistent with an extensive body of advertising research that catalogs the positive but diminishing effects of ad repetition (see, for example, Belch 1982, Cacioppo and Petty 1979).
2.3. Pooling and Varying Ad Themes In an environment in which firms air pools of ad themes in their campaigns, it is conceivable that some themes could affect each other. For example, airing ad themes concurrently could perhaps increase interference or clutter (Kent 1991, Kent and Allen 1993, Kumar 2000, Kumar and Krishnan 2004), which could, in turn, diminish ad quality. Yet, varying the pool of ads presented for a brand could increase overall effectiveness of the individual pieces of advertising (cf. Grass and Wallace 1969, Rossiter and Percy 1997). Thus, pooling and varying themes may improve the quality of each theme; this suggests (econometrically) a synergistic effect or interdependence among themes, which, in turn, could forestall their wear out (Naik et al. 1998). The theoretical mechanisms hypothesized to explain the effects of ad variation on wear out are available elsewhere in the literature (cf. Burke

and Srull 1988, Kumar 2000, Kumar and Krishnan 2004, Unnava and Burnkrant 1991), and therefore they are not repeated here. Still, practitioners often use two variation strategies (Schumann and Clemons 1989): cosmetic variations, which refer to "peripheral" changes to the ad, such as changes in style, format, or execution; and substantive variations, which refer to changes to the ad, such as changes in the theme or copy found within the ad.
To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies on the effectiveness of the above variation strategies. In two laboratory experiments, however, Schumann et al. (1990) found that cosmetic variation had a greater impact on attitude when motivation to process the ad was low; and conversely, that substantive variation was more influential when motivation to process the ad was high. For ad variation to reduce wear out, the study proposed, consumers must pay greater attention and have more motivation to process advertising. The greater attention paid to emotional ads, as well as their slower wear out (Pechmann and Stewart 1990), is also the reason why emotional ads are more effective in mature market (MacInnis et al. 2002, Chandy et al. 2001). This suggests that in mature markets, substantive variation, which requires a greater level of attention, is probably more effective for emotional ads than for rational ads.

3. Model Development
This section develops a model to account for timevarying forgetting effects and the pooling effects of themes. The model, a generalization of the model by Bass et al. (2007), links demand to weekly ad expenditures incurred in airing different themes. To begin, therefore, I update the discrete-time Nerlove-Arrow (NA) (1962) model in Bass et al. (2007) with a timevarying forgetting rate t:

n

n

Gt = qit-1 g Ait + i h Ait Ajt - tGt-1 (1)

i=1

j =1

j =i

where
g Ait = a function of the ad expenditures Ait on the ith theme at time, t.3
qit-1 = the quality of ith theme at time, t - 1. i h Ait Ajt = an overall measure of how the
ith theme interacts with all other concurrently aired themes at time, t.4

3 The estimation uses a semilog transformation: g Ait = ln 1 + Ait and h Ait Ajt = ln 1 + Ait ln 1 + Ajt . See Bass et al. (2007) for the justifications for these functional forms, and the choice of the NA (1962) model.
4 Because advertising effects persist beyond a week, it is presumed that multiple themes aired in a week are running concurrently.

Gt = goodwill at time, t. t = forgetting rate at time, t.
dt = 1 - t, carry-over rate at time, t. Thus, Equation (1) assumes that goodwill Gt decays in proportion to prior goodwill Gt-1 and is sustained by an additive function of the advertiser's expen-
ditures g Ait on each theme i per week (t). The effect of this expenditure g Ait is moderated by an overall measure ( i h Ait Ajt , negative in Bass et al. 2007) of how theme i interacts with all con-
currently aired themes in week, t. In each week, fur-
thermore, the advertiser is assumed to vary the pool
of themes aired. For example, over three weeks, the
advertiser may air both price and product ads in the
first week while airing only price ads in the second
week and perhaps only product ads in the third. This
theme (substantive) variation, prior research suggests
(Schumann et al. 1990), might forestall quality wear
out, and mitigate the effects of interference, which
could arise when themes are aired concurrently.
Next, to study factors that might explain advertis-
ing decay (Gensch and Welam 1973, Ray et al. 1971,
Blattberg and Jeuland 1981), the forgetting rate t is modeled as a function of prior goodwill and advertis-
ing variables: F Gt-1 Z1t , where the vector of variables Z1t = {Copy Theme and Competitive Ad Spending}; Gt-1 is prior goodwill; and is a vector of parameters to be estimated. To capture the effects of diminish-
ing returns with respect to prior goodwill, a quadratic term G2t-1 is also included in the function. The variable copy theme, the cumulative percent of nonprice
and nonproduct offer ads, controls for the likelihood
that, cumulatively, ads with more emotional themes
(Belch and Belch 1998, pp. 267­271) have a signifi-
cant effect on t. The different effects of emotional and rational themes on wear out are well known
(MacInnis et al. 2002, Chandy et al. 2001). Notably,
t is now a function of the variable competitive ad spending; therefore, ad quality wear out and regenera-
tion are directly linked to the intensity of competitive advertising.5 Finally, because t is between zero and one, I use the generalized logistic (GL) transformation
(Prentice 1975, Carlin and Louis 2000):

t = 1 + exp -F Gt-1 Z1t

-m

(2)

where m > 0 is a shape parameter to be estimated. The GL model has been widely applied in dose re-
sponse studies, where variability in the data cannot be explained by the standard logistic model (i.e., when m = 1). In this study, the GL model has the appealing property of allowing the shape parameter (m) of the forgetting rate to be estimated from the data.

5 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this treatment of competitive advertising.

As discussed in the literature review, the quality qit of an ad theme can vary over time because of three factors: wear out, forgetting, and pooling effects. The following deceptively simple extension of Bass et al. (2007) captures this quality dynamic in difference equation form:

qit = -a Ait qit-1 + b Ait 1 - qit-1 +

ij qjt-1 (3)

j =i

Own Theme Effects

j Pt

Pooling Effects

for i = 1 2 n ad themes, where Pt is the pool of ad themes that are aired in period t, and

a Ait = ci + riAit

(4)

b Ait = t 1 - I Ait

(5)

Specifically, Equations (3)­(5) assume that changes
in the quality of ad theme i are a function of the repetition riAit and copy ci wear outs,6 regeneration because of forgetting effects when the theme is not
repeated b Ait , and pooling effect ij with ad theme j  Pt, j = i. In Equation (3), wear out and forgetting are own theme effects, while pooling effects depend
on the quality and the varying mixture of themes in
pool Pt. In general, the pooling effects parameter ij may be negative or positive: if ij is negative, then ad theme j could help diminish the quality of theme i;
and if ij is positive, then ad theme j could help forestall wear out of theme i. Similarly, when advertis-
ing is off (i.e., indicator function, I Ait = 0 , there is a rejuvenating effect of advertising that is captured by
forgetting (Naik et al. 1998). Finally, when advertising
is on (i.e., indicator function, I Ait = 1 , ad quality changes are now influenced by the negative wear-out
effect -a Ait and pooling effects. Thus, Equations (1)­(5) describe a model created
to investigate the pooling effects of multiple themes
and the factors that might affect ad decay rates in a
multitheme context. Contrary to assumptions in prior
econometric studies (Bass and Clarke 1972, Clarke
1976), forgetting (or carry-over) rates are assumed
to depend on the build-up of goodwill and other
advertising variables. With this model, therefore, deci-
sion makers could track how carry-over rates vary
with advertising variables and modify their strategies
accordingly. The model, furthermore, could reveal
synergies that might exist between pairs of themes;
this knowledge, in turn, could suggest opportunities
to improve theme efficiency (Naik and Raman 2003,
Raman and Naik 2004, Naik et al. 2005). Lastly, the
resulting model, also an extension of the classic NA

model, is nonlinear and dynamic in the goodwill and quality state variables. This raises several new challenges for the estimation procedure that follows.
4. Empirical Analysis
This section presents the empirical analysis of the preceding theoretical model, reviewing the data, empirical model, and estimation procedure employed.
4.1. Data The data for this study come from a major telecommunications services firm. The firm, though it faces competition in the new wireless markets, is a monopolist in the landline telecommunications business.7 Demand data for residential telephone services are available in terms of total call time in millions of hours, aggregated across three call types: local, regional, and national. Other measures--weighted average price per minute, number of residential lines, competitive advertising--are also available to help explain demand variations over time. I aggregate all competitive advertising expenditures into a single measure. The firm, however, disaggregates its advertising into five themes: call stimulation ads, product offer ads, price offer ads, reconnect ads, and reassurance ads. Advertising expenditures for these ad themes and competitive advertising, measured in gross rating points (GRP), are available for a period of 114 weeks, during the years 1995­1997. Summary statistics are given in Tables 2 and 3.
4.2. Empirical Model The empirical model is completed by first linking goodwill to the demand for telephone services, and, then, recasting the demand, goodwill, and ad quality equations into a nonlinear state-space formulation. The state-space approach is convenient for handling multivariate data as well as nonlinear/nonGaussian dynamic systems, and provides significant advantages

6 Recall copy wear out occurs because of the passage of time, regardless of the frequency of advertising. In contrast, repetition wear out is a consequence of excessive frequency (Naik et al. 1998).

7 The residential market naturally faces some competition from mobile providers because some consumer calls are substitutable between fixed and wireless providers.

over traditional time series techniques (see, for exam-

Specifically, demand for residential telephone serv-
ices (yt), at time t is modeled as a function of goodwill (Gt), a vector Xt with variables price and number of lines; and mean zero normally distributed error, vt.

Price and advertising are two potential sources of endogeneity. Price endogeneity could arise because of omitted variables, and advertising endogeneity could arise if the firm chooses ad expenditures strategically. I address price endogeneity with standard instrumental variable methods,8 using the following instruments: retail price index, number of households, consumer sentiment, household spending, competitive advertising, and number of lines. Addressing advertising endogeneity, however, poses two significant modeling challenges: (i) the coefficient qit of the endogenous variable, advertising is time-varying and (ii) ad expenditures are observed only when the firm advertises. Both challenges can be overcome (see, for example, Kim 2006) once good instruments are available. However, I leave the study of endogeneity bias in advertising as an issue for a future study, acknowledging that this is a potential limitation of the present study.
Given the above demand model, it is now convenient to recast Equations (1)­(6) into a more compact, nonlinear state-space formulation

t = ft t-1 + ut

(2007) compared two methods for incorporating price endogeneity: (i) a two-step approach that involves estimating a Bayesian regression of price on all exogenous and instrumental variables, and replacing price in the DLM with its predictive values obtained from the Bayesian regression and (ii) a fully Bayesian instrumental variable procedure given in Rossi et al. (2005). The substantive results were unchanged across both methods. Thus, to be consistent, I follow Bass et al. (2007) and report results based on method (1).

element of the state vector t is goodwill, and the remaining elements are (n) advertising qualities, one
for each theme. Error terms, ut and vt, are assumed to be mean zero, independent normal variables. Notably,
while the observation Equation (7) is linear, the sys-
tem Equation (8) is nonlinear in the state variables
(goodwill and quality) because the forgetting rate t is a function of the prior goodwill Gt-1. This nonlinearity has implications for the Bayesian procedure next
prescribed.

4.3. Model Estimation Bayesian methods provide a rigorous framework for estimating the dynamic system defined by Equations (7) and (8). The approach estimates the probability density function (pdf) of the state vector t based on the information available up to time period, t. In linear normal systems (cf. Naik et al. 1998, Neelamegham and Chintagunta 2004, Van Heerde et al. 2004, Liechty et al. 2005), this pdf is normal at every period and the basic Kalman filter applies. In nonlinear (e.g., Equation (8)) or nonGaussian systems, however, there is no general (or closed-form) expression for this pdf, so it has to be approximated. Two early approximation algorithms are the extended Kalman filter (EKF) (Anderson and Moore 1979) and the grid-based (GB) filter (Bucy and Senne 1971). Even so, to estimate the pdf of t, this study employs the particle filter (Doucet et al. 2001, Liu and Chen 1998). Particle filtering belongs to a class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) integration methods that are based on Bayesian inference. It involves the use of particles (or samples) and their associated weights to approximate the pdf cited above. Unlike EKF and GB methods, particle filters are flexible, convenient, and have been successful in a wide range of complex applications, especially in visual tracking and surveillance (Ristic et al. 2004). Moreover, because the particle filter uses independent samples, it avoids the convergence difficulties (or "stickiness") associated with traditional MCMC procedures (Gamerman 1997).

4.3.1. Particle Filtering and MCMC. More for-

mally, then, the Bayesian estimation of the above dis-

crete system involves first specifying priors for all

model parameters, and then using particle filters to

estimate the state vectors, and MCMC to estimate

the hyperparameters. Let 0 T = 0 1 2

In addition, with the filtered density and a sequence

of predictions in hand, one can use a Monte Carlo

approach to compute forecasts that parallel those

produced in linear state-space models (West and

Harrison 1997). For example, t+k t = E t+k y1 t denotes the expected state vector at period t + k given

telephone usage observed through period t. By defi-

nition, this k-step ahead forecast is given by

t+k t =

t+kp t+k y1 t d t+k

This step-ahead procedure is later employed to assess the forecasts of several alternative specifications.

4.4. Model Assessment
To investigate the importance of pooling effects and
a dynamic forgetting rate, I compare the proposed
model (Model 7) to six plausible alternate specifi-
cations. The first (Model 1) has a constant forget-
ting rate and no pooling or interaction effects ( t = , i = 0 ij = 0). The second (Model 2) has a con-
stant forgetting rate ( t = ) and no interaction effects ( i = 0 , but an overall pooling effect i for each theme. The third (Model 3) has a dynamic forgetting

rate ( t) and no pooling or interaction effects ( i = 0 ij = 0). The fourth (Model 4) has a dynamic forget-
ting rate ( t) and an overall pooling effect i for each theme, but no interaction effects ( i = 0). The fifth (Model 5), proposed in Bass et al. (2007), has a constant forgetting rate, interaction effects, and no pooling effects ( t = i = 0 ij = 0). The sixth (Model 6) has a dynamic forgetting rate and pooling effects ij , but no interaction effects ( i = 0). Models 1, 2, and 5 are linear state-space models; Models 3, 4, 6, and 7 are nonlinear. In addition, the nonlinear models were estimated assuming two specifications for predictors Z1t of the forgetting rate ( t). In the first, prior goodwill and competitive advertising are log transformed; in the second, they remain untransformed.
Table 4 compares the six alternatives to the proposed model using log Bayes factors. A log Bayes factor greater than two provides strong evidence in favor of the proposed model (West and Harrison 1997). For the nonlinear models (Models 3, 4, 6, and 7), I report the specifications that used the log transformed predictors for t because these specifications, in terms of log Bayes factors, dominated those with the untransformed predictors. Overall, the log Bayes factors in Table 4 clearly reject all alternatives in favor of the proposed model (Model 7). Furthermore, the model with only pooling effects (Model 2) and the model with only dynamic forgetting (Model 3) dominate the model with the constant forgetting rate and no pooling or interaction effects (Model 1). Similarly, based on log Bayes factors, nonlinear Model 6 also outperforms Model 5, the linear Bass et al. (2007) model. For further evidence of model fit, I compare the predictive (in-sample) performance of all models using two measures: mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root mean square error (RMSE). These two measures in Table 4 are the lowest for the proposed model.
Finally, to compare out-of-sample forecasts of all seven specifications, I apply the step-ahead algorithm outlined in forecasting Equations (9)­(10). For each specification, telephone usage forecasts E yt+k y1 t are generated using two sample (t = 1 50, t = 1 90) and forecast (k-step ahead) time periods (k = 1 5, k = 1 10). Table 5 reports the MAD and RMSE of these

forecasts. The evidence clearly supports the predictive performance of the proposed model (Model 7). Thus, taken together, these fit and forecast measures suggest the importance of accounting for pooling effects and a dynamic forgetting rate.
5. Results
Table 6 presents the main results from the particle filter/MCMC estimation of the proposed model. It shows estimates of the mean, standard deviation, and 95% highest probability density interval (HPDI) of each parameter. Parameter estimates for price, capacity, wear out, and interaction are comparable to those previously discussed in Bass et al. (2007); thus, that earlier discussion will not be repeated here. The primary focus here will be on results related to forgetting, carry-over, and pooling effects.
Estimates related to the forgetting rate t are largely consistent with conjectures in Gensch and Welam (1973), experimental findings in Ray et al. (1971), and analytic findings in Blattberg and Jeuland (1981). That is, carry-over rates dt = 1 - t might not be constant as historically assumed (cf. Bass and Clarke 1972, Clarke 1976, Hanssens et al. 1990), but might be time varying and affected by several advertising variable. First, the linear and quadratic effects of prior goodwill Gt-1 are significant; the linear effect is negative, and the quadratic effect is positive. Hence the probability of carry-over demand could first increase with prior ad spending, but at a diminishing rate, and then decrease when prior ad expenditures attain some level of overspending (Bultez and Naert 1979). As cited earlier, this result is consistent with an extensive body of work that catalogs the positive but diminishing effects of ad repetition (cf. Belch 1982, Cacioppo and Petty 1979). Second, the effect of competitive advertising on the forgetting rate

is positive but insignificant. Presumably, competitive advertising could accelerate forgetting and shorten the duration (Clarke 1976) of advertising effectiveness (cf. Assmus et al. 1984, Kent 1991, Kent and Allen 1993). However, the lack of a significant effect in this study may be a result of the firm's dominance in its category.
Third, the effect of ad theme on the forgetting rate t is negative and significant, indicating that the effects of prior ad spending become more short lived as the cumulative percentage of price and product offer ads increase. To gain some insight into this finding, one should recall the theme classification adopted in Bass et al. (2007), which though informal has support in Belch and Belch (1998, pp. 267­271). The classification suggests that price and product offer ads have more rational appeals than call stimulation, reassurance, and reconnect ads. This third finding, therefore, suggests that rational ads are more short lived. This seems consistent with prior studies that suggest rational ads wear out faster than emotional ads and are less effective in mature markets (e.g., residential telephone services) (Chandy et al. 2001). Estimates of the pooling effects ij are all positive, and several are significant. This implies that pooling and varying ad themes (substantive variation) can forestall the wear out of individual ad themes; analogous to the manner in which varying the executions (cosmetic variation) of an ad theme may forestall its wear out (Unnava and Burnkrant 1991). Pooling estimates ij also vary widely. For example, the effect of product offer on call stimulation is 0.5285, while the effect of call stimulation on product offer is 0.0988. Similarly, the effect of price offer on reassurance is 0.5612, while the effect of reassurance on price offer is 0.1603. Based on the above theme classification, these results reveal an important asymmetry. For any pair of emotional ad theme (i) and rational ad theme (j), the effects of theme (j) on theme (i) is greater than the effects of theme (i) on theme (j), ij > ji . This asymmetry suggests that wear out reduction because of pooling and varying of ad themes might differ across emotional and rational messages. I shall return to this question presently. Still, beyond reducing wear out, advertisers could benefit from airing multiple ad themes because purchase decisions are often based on multiple criteria. For example, many purchases are not based solely on price--product features are often just as important. Moreover, purchases decisions are often made because of both rational and emotional motives (Belch and Belch 1998, pp. 271­272).9 Figure 1 shows
9 According to Ogilvy and Raphaelson (1982, p. 18), "Few purchases of any kind are made for entirely rational reasons. Even a purely functional product such as laundry detergent may offer what is

schematically pooling effects ij that are positive and significant at the 95% level, and suggests theme synergies the firms may exploit, when scheduling advertising. The arrows in Figure 1 point in the direction of the effect. For example, call stimulation ads improve the effectiveness of price offer ads, but not vice versa. Other effects are interdependent, in that each theme directly improves the others effectiveness. Thus the ad theme pairs--price offer and product offer, reassurance and reconnect, reassurance and call stimulation--and product offer and call stimulation--are interdependent.
Finally, to return to the question of why pooling effects might benefit emotional appeals more than rational appeals, it is necessary to recall that emotional appeals are more effective in mature markets (Chandy et al. 2001). The effectiveness of emotional appeals is related to their greater impact on memory--e.g., greater attention and recall (Olney et al. 1991, Thorson and Page 1988). Thus, in mature markets, theme (substantive) variation, more effective at higher levels of attention (Schumann et al. 1990), can have a greater effect on emotional themes. This, in turn, implies that, along with wear-out rates, pooling effects ij can differ across emotional and rational ad themes. Table 7 examines this implication. It reports average pooling effects, repetition wear out, and number of executions for each advertising theme. Note that reassurance had the highest average pooling effect. Moreover, the average pooling effect is larger for emotional ads than it is for rational ads; this suggests that the strategy of pooling and varying ad themes (substantive variation) could be more effective for emotional ads. Consider also the number of executions and the repetition wear out for each theme in Table 7. Note that as the number of executions increases, repetition wear out decreases. Rational ads, with the highest number of executions, have the smallest wear-out rates; and therefore might benefit more from cosmetic variation.
now called an `emotional end benefit'--say, the satisfaction of seeing one's children in bright, clean clothes. In some product categories, the rational element is small. These include soft drinks, beer, cosmetics, certain personal-care products, and most fashion products. And who hasn't experienced the surge of joy that accompanies the purchase of a new car?"

5.1. The Implied Carry Over Effects of Themes As cited in the introduction, advertising theme efficiency depends more generally on the decay in carry-over effects from prior goodwill. It is therefore worthwhile to explore the impact of a dynamic carryover rate dt on demand attributable to past thematic advertising. An implied measure of this demand can be derived by substituting the goodwill Equation (1) recursively into the demand Equation (7) to obtain the nonlinear distributed lag form (see Gensch and Welam 1973, Hitsch 2006)

and

From Equation (11), the implied carry-over demand

in week (t) is a separable nonlinear function of the

prior ad spending. It is also noteworthy to con-

sider the set of lag weights Sit applied to prior

ad spending for a given theme, i: Sit = dtqit-2

dt dt-1qit-3 dt dt-1dt-2qit-4

. These weights, unlike

those in early studies (cf. Bass and Clarke 1972, Clarke

1976), are time varying; this means carry-over also

depends on the period an ad is aired (Thaivanich et al.

2000), as well as on the variables that may moderate

wear out and forgetting t . Moreover, these timevarying weights imply that there is no single expo-

nential decay function for past advertising as implied

in early studies (e.g., Clarke 1976), but a family of

such functions, in this case, one for each period (t  2)

and theme (see Ray et al. 1971, p. 14). With Equation (11), it is possible to derive implied estimates of the carry-over by theme per week, using mean values of the state variables and hyperparameters (see the appendix).
Table 8 reports the total carry-over demand (t = 2 3 T ) for each theme (divided by total theme spending), based on the estimates in Model 7 (the full model) and Model 5 (Bass et al. 2007), with and without interaction effects ( i). These interaction effects were found to be negative, and more so for emotional ads. There are several interesting observations in Table 8. First, carry-over varies considerably across themes. For example, in the proposed model, when interaction is set to zero ( i = 0), product offer has the lowest carry-over (1.3932), while reconnect has the highest (2.2845). Moreover, in both models (with i = 0), price and product offer (rational themes) have the lowest carry-over, analogous to results in prior studies that suggest that rational ads wear out faster than emotional ads. Conversely, when interaction is not set to zero ( i = 0) in the proposed model, reassurance has the lowest (0.6199), and call stimulation the highest (1.0382). Thus, in a multitheme context, where some themes are aired concurrently, quality wear out alone probably provides an inaccurate summary of ad efficiency.
Second, the carry-over measure for each theme is higher in Model 5, suggesting a bias if one assumes the forgetting rate is constant. The size of bias averages 48% and ranges from 5% to 119%. Additional support for this result emerges from Figure 2--plots of the mean and 95% interval for the dynamic carryover rate dt across the 114 weeks. Here, the constant carry-over rate in Model 5 exceeds the mean of dt (0.9550), inflating the effects prior ads on current demand.
5.2. Multitheme Budgeting with Pooling Effects A major goal of this study is to show the implications of pooling effects on the ad planner's budget allocation problem. Thus, in this section, I reconsider the budgeting problem over time, across the five advertising themes, and under two scenarios: pooling effects (Model 7) and no pooling effects (Model 5). In each scenario, price offer and product offer themes

had the two highest copy wear out but the lowest

repetition wear-out rates. With pooling effects, how-

ever, call stimulation and product offer ads could

increase the quality of price ads, and reassurance

themes had the highest average pooling effects. How

might these results affect the budget allocation deci-

sions and demand for telephone services? It turns out

that with pooling effects (Model 7), advertisers can

exploit synergies among ad themes to increase adver-

tising efficiency (Raman and Naik 2004, Naik et al.

2005).

To show this increased efficiency, I develop a model

that reallocates the total advertising GRPs (bt) in each period, across the five themes to maximize the total

The purpose of F1 is to suggest implications of the pooling effects parameters, and the solutions should not be interpreted as optimal in the strategic (or game-theoretic) sense.

2.0% increase in total hours. 4.4% increase in total hours.

Table 9 reports one such allocation, along with the reallocation based on Model 5 (Bass et al. 2007). Recall, without pooling effects (Model 5), the reallocation shifts resources markedly away from both price and product ads, i.e., ads with the high copy wearout rates. This reallocation created an additional 35.82 million hours of calling time, a 2.0% increase over the actual demand. With pooling effects, however, the solution to (F1) would increase ad expenditures on reconnect, reassurance, and now price ads, while decreasing expenditures on the other two themes. Reassurance had the highest percentage (251.7%) increase in allocation and product offer had the highest percentage (46.5%) decrease. This reallocation of advertising would create an additional 83.13 million hours of calling time, a 4.4% increase over the actual demand. Therefore, in the presence of pooling effects, increased expenditures on price offer and reassurance ads could lead to greater telephone use (i.e., greater ad efficiency). Recall that reassurance had the highest average pooling effect and price ad benefits from the quality of call stimulation and product ads. Thus, not only do pooling effects benefit emotional ads, but pooling effects might also mitigate the negative wearout effects of rational, price offer ads; as a result, rational messages can be more effective when combined with emotional messages (Belch and Belch 1998, Ogilvy and Raphaelson 1982).

6. Conclusion
This study investigates the factors that could affect the rates at which advertising decays over time, the pooling effects of different themes, and the implications of these effects on the allocation of advertising resources. In doing so, it extends the linear NA (1962) model employed in Bass et al. (2007), to a nonlinear model of advertising quality and goodwill. The extended model is estimated using a combination of MCMC and particle filtering ideas. Particle filtering belongs to a class of SMC methods developed to estimate nonlinear/nonGaussian dynamic systems. The results should be of interest to advertisers and integrated marketing communications managers who are concerned with synergies when scheduling multitheme advertising.

The study offers several interesting insights related to the issues of pooling themes and advertising decay. First, estimates related to advertising decay are consistent with conjectures in Gensch and Welam (1973), experimental findings in Ray et al. (1971), and analytic findings in Blattberg and Jeuland (1981). That is, forgetting (carry-over) rates could be time varying and affected by prior goodwill and copy theme. Furthermore, I demonstrate that a constant rate could bias the demand attributable to past advertising. Timevarying rates, on the other hand, imply that there is no single decay function for prior advertising, but a family of decay functions, in this study, one for each period and theme. Ad decay, then, may be a far more complex phenomenon than econometric studies in marketing have traditionally assumed. Second, pooling effects were positive, suggesting that pooling and varying ad themes could forestall wear out, analogous to the manner in which varying the executions of ads for a fixed theme could forestall the wear out of that theme (Unnava and Burnkrant 1991). Therefore, advertisers in multitheme contexts could use multiple executions of the same theme or vary themes to forestall wear out. Rational themes had on average a higher number of executions and lower repetition wear outs, which could mean that airing multiple executions of same theme (i.e., cosmetic variation) is more effective for rational ads. Emotional themes, however, had on average higher pooling effects, which suggests that pooling and varying ad themes (i.e., substantive variation) could be more effective for emotional ads (Schumann and Clemons 1989). Finally, the results of the budget reallocation experiment suggest that advertising is more efficient when pooling effects are present, and pooling effects could mitigate the higher wear-out rates of rational themes.
Yet, this work has several potential limitations. For example, the study treats advertising as an exogenous variable. Presumably, advertising should be treated as an endogenous variable as assumed for price, if managers allocate advertising in a strategic manner. However, given that the estimation uses weekly data, it is perhaps much less likely that endogeneity will be a major factor (Leeflang et al. 2000, p. 382). Still, advertising endogeneity in this state-space model can be addressed in the future if good instruments are available (e.g., Kim 2006). The study could perhaps also have modeled competition more fully, for example, modeling the dynamic effectiveness of competitive advertising. Yet, the firm analyzed here is a monopolist in its category, and so dynamic competition was not modeled explicitly. The NA (1962) model, however, has been commonly extended in the differential game literature to model dynamic advertising competition (e.g., Jorgensen and Zaccour 2004). Thus, given

data on competitor's demand, one could draw on these extensions to model dynamic competition more fully and formally.
A future direction for this research could be to extend the model to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of forgetting and satiation at the consumer level. This could, however, pose an interesting computational problem, if the number of consumers is large. Because, then, the state space would also be large, and the particle filter could become unwieldy. Thus, one might have to use procedures to reduce the size of the state space. Finally, particle filters have been widely applied to eye tracking research, where nonlinearity and microdynamics are important (Perez et al. 2004), and thus could find applications in the nascent area of visual marketing (e.g., eye tracking, eye movement studies; Pieters and Wedel 2000, Pieters et al. 1999).

Appendix This appendix provides an overview of the posterior sampling algorithm. The algorithm combines MCMC and particle filtering/smoothing methods (cf. Doucet et al. 2001, Ristic et al. 2004, Liu and Chen 1998, Godsill et al. 2004). The sampling scheme adopts a particle approach because our model belongs to a class of dynamic systems in which the observation Equation (7) is linear, but the system Equation (8) is nonlinear in the state variables. The algorithm should be regarded as a nonlinear/nonGaussian version of the Kalman filter/smoother algorithm for Bayesian DLMs (cf. Carter and Kohn 1994, Fruhwirth-Schnatter 1994). The appendix begins by briefly motivating the nonlinear filtering problem, and then provides a general description of a particle/MCMC solution.

A1. Nonlinear Filtering Problem

Let 0 T = 0 1 2

T be the relevant state vectors,

and let y1 T = y1 y2

yT be telephone usage observed

across the entire data set t  t = 1 T . Recall the first

element of this state vector t is goodwill, and the remaining elements are (n) advertising qualities, one for each ad

theme. Suppose further that the most recent values of the

hyperparameters =

i ci ri

i

n i=1

,

2 v

,

Q

and

are

available but excluded from description of the state den-

sities to simplify the exposition. The goal, then, is to esti-

mate the full conditional posterior distribution of the states

p 0 T y1 T and, recursively, the filtered (or marginal) states p t y1 t .
The full conditional posterior is given by Bayes rule

p

0 T y1 T =

p y1 T 0 T p 0 T p y1 T 0 T p 0 T d 0 T

(12)

But the filtered states are obtained, recursively, via the standard one-step-ahead prediction and updating steps, (12) and (13)

Prediction p t y1 t-1 = p t t-1 p t-1 y1 t-1 d t-1

(13)

Update

p t y1 t =

p yt t p t y1 t-1 p yt t p t y1 t-1 d t

(14)

Equation (12) and recursive relationships in Equations (13) and (14) form the foundation for a conceptual Bayesian solution to all state-space systems. The integrals in (12) to (14), however, are unavailable analytically in the case of nonlinear/nonGaussian dynamic systems. This study therefore employs a Monte Carlo integration approach, the particle filter.

A2. Particle Filtering/Smoothing

Sequential importance sampling (SIS) forms the basis for

several Monte Carlo filters, including the particle fil-

ter, which I now briefly describe. SIS extends the basic

importance sampling results to the sequential (or time-

varying) case. (For background information, see Geweke

1989, Gelfand and Smith 1990.) A full description is also

available in, for example, Doucet et al. (2001). To give

an overview here, let

h 0T

wTh

Hs h=1

be a random measure

that characterizes the full conditional posterior p 0 T y1 T ,

where

h 0T

h=0

1

Hs is a set of support points (or

particles) with associated weights wTh h = 0 1

Hs ; 0 T

and y1 T are as previously defined. Suppose the particles

and weights are chosen based on importance sampling

ideas with the weights normalized such that

Hs h=1

wTh

=

1,

where wTh > 0. Then, formally, an approximation to the full

conditional posterior p 0 T y1 T is given by

Hs
p 0 T y1 T  wTh
h=1

0T -

h 0T

(15)

where · is the dirac delta measure.
Now, consider a recursive procedure to approximate the
filtered states defined by (13) and (14), i.e., p t y1 t  p yt t p t t-1 p t-1 y1 t-1 . Suppose at time t - 1, samples and weights are available to approximate the distri-
bution p t-1 y1 t-1 ; then at time t, one can approximate p t y1 t by augmenting the existing samples with a new set of samples of the state vector at time, t. More precisely,
if the importance density (see Geweke 1989) is chosen to
factorise as follows:

q t y1 t = q t t-1 y1 t q t-1 y1 t-1

(16)

then the new particles

h Hs t h=1

are

drawn

from

h t



q

h t

h t-1

y1 t

, where the weights and the filtered states are

as follows (Doucet et al. 2001, 1999; Ristic et al. 2004):

and (17)

h t

Hs h=1

is

a

discrete

approximation

of

p

t

y1 t .

The major problem with the SIS particle filter is the

degeneracy phenomenon, where after a certain number of

recursive steps, all but one particle have neglible weights.

Several versions of the particle filter have been developed to

address this problem (Doucet et al. 2001). Even so, I use two

standard and convenient methods mentioned in the SMC

literature: (i) resampling and (ii) choice of the importance

function.

First, a common measure of degeneracy is the effective

sample size

Heff =

1

Hs h=1

wth 2

(18)

where wth is the normalized weights obtained in (17). If Heff is small and Heff < Hs, then degeneracy is indicated.
So to reduce degeneracy, resampling with replacement is

done if Heff is below some threshhold. Second, degeneracy is also reduced by the choice of the importance function.

Therefore the particles will be sampled from the optimal

importance function, p t t-1 y1 t , which is available analytically because here the observation Equation (7) is lin-

ear. Ristic et al. (2004) show that this importance function

q t t-1 yt = p t t-1 yt is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the variance of the importance weights. I choose

sample size Hs = 1 000 and a threshold of 0 8Hs values observed in the literature.

At this point, we have a mechanism to obtain a par-

ticle (or discrete) representation of the filtered densities

p t y1 t . Smoothed estimates can also be derived based on this discrete representation. For example, Godsill et al.

(2004) provide such a method for smoothing computations,

as well as for generating random samples from the above

filtered particles. First, recall from Godsill et al. (2004) that

smoothing is based on the factorization

p t t+1 y1 T  p t y1 t f t+1 t

(19)

That means, by using weighted resampling ideas (Geweke 1989), one can resample backward using the filtered particles and the revised weights

wth t+1 =

wthf t+1

h t

Hs h=1

wth

f

t+1

h t

(20)

In other words, for backward smoothing, all one needs to

do is reweight the filtered sample according to (20).

The following, then, is the psuedocode for the par-

ticle filtering/smoothing algorithm just briefly decribed.

As noted above, it should be regarded as a nonlin-

ear/nonGaussian version of the Kalman filter/smoother

algorithm for Bayesian DLMs (cf. Carter and Kohn 1994,

Fruhwirth-Schnatter 1994).

described in Carlin and Louis (2000, pp. 155­157).
