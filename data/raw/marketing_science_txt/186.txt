Abstract. In this paper, I introduce a framework of price promotions by firms that preschedule their sale dates. I set up a dynamic model of demand accumulation in which high- and low-valuation consumers enter the market every period. The high-valuation consumers buy immediately and leave the market; the low-valuation consumers accumulate while waiting for the sale price. The firms schedule the dates of their promotions in advance. I find that often they use mixed strategies, choosing the future promotion period according to a probability distribution function. If the firms can cancel their prescheduled sales, typically they can wait longer until holding sales by shifting the probability distribution towards later periods. Scheduling promotions in advance increases the firms' profits in comparison to the case when the promotion decision is made in the period when the promotion is offered.

1. Introduction
Temporary price promotions or sales remain an important marketing tool used by firms. In addition to continuing interest in this topic in the fields of marketing and industrial organization (see Narasimhan 2009 for a literature review), the behavior of promotional prices has recently attracted a lot of attention in the macroeconomic literature. Because the effects of fiscal and monetary policies crucially depend on the frequency of price adjustments, papers in this literature explore how to properly account for the price variations caused by temporary sales (Nakamura and Steinsson 2008, Eichenbaum et al. 2011, Guimaraes and Sheedy 2011, Coibon et al. 2012, Kehoe and Madrigan 2015, Anderson et al. 2017).
There is an abundance of various theoretical frameworks for modeling sales. These include static models of price discrimination between consumers with different information about prices (Varian 1980), dynamic models of intertemporal price discrimination between consumers with different product valuations (Sobel 1984) or between consumers with different inventory holding costs (Blattberg et al. 1981), and multiperiod models of clearance sales under demand uncertainty (Lazear 1986), etc. However, almost all existing models of sales neglect to incorporate an important institutional feature, i.e., the fact that price promotions are typically set in advance.1
Firms often offer temporary price discounts combined with other elements of the promotional mix such

as in-store displays and feature advertising. In anticipation of high demand, they stock up on inventory and perhaps train the sales force. All of these activities require preparation and are planned in advance. For example, BeautyMark Marketing, a firm specializing in designing marketing strategies for beauty businesses, advises firms to start planning promotions three months in advance (BeautyMark Marketing 2015). Blattberg and Neslin (1990) provide an example of a manufacturer's promotion calendar that shows the upcoming promotion events for the whole year. Consistent with this example, Anderson et al. (2017) report that the timing of trade promotions is planned up to a year in advance.
What are the firms' optimal promotional strategies if they have to set sale dates in advance? How are these strategies affected by market characteristics? What is the impact of committing to a future promotion date on the firms' profits? How do firms adjust the strategies if cancellations of prescheduled sales are possible? This paper develops the framework to address these questions.
Following Sobel (1984), I set up a dynamic model of demand accumulation in which high- and low-valuation consumers enter the market every period. The high-valuation consumers buy the product immediately and leave the market, whereas the low-valuation consumers wait for a sale and come back the next period if they do not purchase in the current period. This leads to an accumulation of the low-valuation consumers.

In this model, there are two firms in the market. Each period, they could charge a regular price that targets only the high-valuation consumers or a sale price at which both types of consumers purchase. The sale price then clears the market of the accumulated lowvaluation consumers. The novel feature of my model is that the firms must schedule their price promotions in advance. Thus, in the beginning of the first period, each firm chooses a future period in which to hold a sale.
In the marketing literature, a commitment to a future price path is explicitly modeled in Cui et al. (2008) who examine a monopolist manufacturer selling to retailers with different inventory costs. The optimal strategy of the manufacturer is to offer the lowest wholesale price in the first period of the pricing cycle and then to gradually increase it for an endogenously determined number of periods. The presence of the commitment to future prices, however, does not drive any of their results since, as Cui et al. (2008) show, at no time does the monopolist have an incentive to deviate from the preannounced prices. By contrast, the presence of the commitment to future prices is crucial in my model since in some periods a firm would have preferred to keep its price high instead of holding a prescheduled sale or it would have preferred to hold a sale in a period when no sale had been scheduled.
Another paper that discusses the effect of a price commitment of a firm selling to different types of consumers is Villas-Boas and Villas-Boas (2008) who consider a monopolist determining the optimal time period between its sales in the presence of consumer learning and forgetting. In their model, during each period a fraction of consumers becomes uninformed and forgets whether they like the product. Being unsure about the product utility, they do not purchase at the high price that the monopolist charges to capture the surplus from the informed consumers. When a sufficient number of uninformed consumers accumulates, the monopolist drops the price to let these consumers try the product and learn about the fit. In future periods, the monopolist captures a larger surplus from those who turn out to value the product highly. VillasBoas and Villas-Boas (2008) argue that the ability to commit to a sequence of prices decreases the interval between sales.
The two models discussed above examined the optimal pricing strategies of a monopolist. By contrast, I study the interaction between two competing firms. I start my analysis by introducing a basic finite-horizon framework in which at the start of the first period, the firms commit to a future sale date. I show that the firms choose a sale period with certainty, i.e., a pure-strategy equilibrium exists, only in a two- or a three-period model with the number of low-valuation consumers entering each period being relatively large or the sale

price being high. For the model with more than three periods, pure-strategy equilibria do not exist. The firms can then use mixed strategies, choosing the period in which they will hold a sale according to a probability distribution function. The support of this function is bounded by the starting period, i.e., the earliest period in which the firms consider holding a sale, and the ending period by which a sale occurs with certainty. The starting period is chosen by the firms and is endogenous. In the finite-horizon model, the ending period is the last period. For all of the periods in between, the probability that a sale occurs in that period must be specified. These probabilities sum up to 1. To satisfy the requirement of a mixed-strategy equilibrium, the resulting probability distribution must be chosen in such a way that each firm's ex ante expected profit is the same regardless of which period was selected for a price promotion.
Additional requirements are necessary to make the optimal strategies deviation-proof. First, the firms should not deviate to always charging the regular price and not scheduling a sale. Second, the firms should not deviate to scheduling a sale before the starting period. I find that for any number of periods in the model, the starting period and the corresponding probability distribution over sale periods are uniquely determined. This probability distribution depends only on the number of periods in the model, and not on the sale price or the size of the consumer segments. The expected perperiod profit increases with the sale price and with the share of high-valuation consumers.
I consider several extensions of the basic framework. First, I examine the possibility of the firms canceling their prescheduled sales. For the majority of model parameters, the ability to cancel sales leads the firms to shift the sale probabilities toward later periods. This results in a higher expected per-period profit than the one in the original model without sale cancellations.
The second extension considers the possibility of the firms varying the sale price. Thus, in addition to selecting a sale period, the firms choose a corresponding sale price for that period. In this extension, the lowvaluation consumers have heterogeneous tastes for the firms' products. I find that the firms charge lower sale prices in the earlier periods. When consumer heterogeneity is low, in addition to randomly choosing a sale period, the firms randomize between sale prices.
In Section 7, I consider an infinite-horizon model in which the firms make repeated sale scheduling decisions. In this model, the firms choose the starting and the ending period for the sale probability distribution. I find that when the firms commit to a future sale date, they can increase their profits compared to the model in which the promotion decision is made in the period when the promotion is offered.

2. Basic Framework with Commitment
In this section, I set up a basic discrete-time dynamic framework with two firms competing in prices and specify how to incorporate prescheduling of sales into the firms' strategies. The demand side of the market is similar to Sobel (1984).2 In each period, 2H + L consumers enter the market. There are 2H high-valuation loyal consumers who are willing to pay the regular price for the product. They always buy from their favorite firm. Each firm has H loyal consumers. I normalize the regular price to 1.3
The remaining L consumers are switchers who have a low valuation for the product; they buy only if it is offered at a discounted price p < 1. The low-valuation consumers can purchase from either firm, but they incur a small search cost  > 0 when they sample a price from an additional firm. As shown by Diamond (1971), the equilibrium search behavior of these consumers and the corresponding pricing strategies of the firms are as follows. The firms' optimal strategy when they want to target the low-valuation consumers is to charge exactly p. Correspondingly, when a low-valuation consumer encounters the sale price p, he knows that the rival firm will not offer a lower price, so he does not search. Knowing that the low-valuation consumers do not search after encountering price p, a firm that targets these consumers has no incentive to lower its price below p. Hence, in equilibrium, the firms will charge the regular price 1 or the sale price p. This allows me to focus on the timing of promotions rather than on the discount depth. In Section 6, I consider the lowvaluation consumers who have zero search costs and show how to incorporate into the model the possibility of competition in sale prices.
The strategy of a low-valuation consumer is then to check the price of a random firm. If it is p, the consumer purchases the product from that firm. If it is 1, the consumer checks the price of another firm. If this firm charges p, the consumer makes a purchase. If it also charges 1, i.e., neither firm holds a sale, the lowvaluation consumers return next period and repeats their search. Therefore, the number of low-valuation consumers in the market is given by nL, where n is the number of periods since the last sale held by either firm.
By contrast to Sobel's (1984) environment with contemporaneous pricing decisions, this paper considers the framework with the firms setting sales in advance. Here the issue of prescheduling sale dates and committing to them is central and warrants elaboration. Anderson et al. (2017) report that in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry, the schedule of sales and associated promotional activities is specified up to a year in advance. To gain additional insight into the planning of price promotions, I interviewed several managers who were involved in making promotion

1001
decisions for the firms in three industries: consumer electronics, processed meats, and cookies. There are some differences between the industries, but the key features are common.
First, promotions are scheduled well in advance with the lead time ranging from one quarter to one year. This is necessary to allow sufficient time for planning and coordinating between multiple parties involved in a promotion. Frequently, promotions are accompanied by media advertising, which must be purchased six to eight weeks in advance. A firm needs to increase its production in anticipation of high demand. Depending on the industry, the lead time on production increase ranges from four weeks to six months. In a vertical relationship, a promotion must be coordinated between a manufacturer and a retailer with agreements on additional marketing mix elements, such as in-store displays and feature advertising.
After scheduling, firms do retain some flexibility over promotions. Adjustments occur mostly due to competitor moves and changes in demand. However, these modifications usually involve changing only the discount depth, not the weeks in which sales are scheduled. In some industries, even the decision about the sale price must be made well in advance. For example, in the CPG industry, Anderson et al. (2017) reported that when they were involved in setting the discount depth on a sample of products, the lead time was almost four months.
Having established that an effective price promotion requires a significant amount of advance planning, another question is whether it is possible to cancel a scheduled promotion if a firm realizes that it will not generate sufficient sales. It turns out that even though cancellations are possible, they are costly, and firms try to avoid them. One of the costs associated with a sale cancellation is the inventory cost. Although an undesirable sale will not generate the expected lift, it would still move more inventory than a regular price. Thus, canceling a sale could impose significant inventory costs. These costs increase in importance if a product is perishable. Another cost of sale cancellations is the deterioration of a long-term relationship with retailers who had this promotion in their plans. An example of an actual sale cancellation stemmed from logistics: Supply chain disruptions led to an insufficient inventory for holding a sale, so the firm had to cancel. Given the sizeable costs associated with canceling a prescheduled sale, in my basic framework, I assume that sales cannot be cancelled. In Section 5, I examine how the optimal strategies of the firms change if cancellations are possible.
In summary, conversations with the managers confirmed that to run an effective price promotion, it is often necessary to plan it well in advance. To model this feature of real life sales, I assume that each

firm chooses a future sale date at the start of the first period. The firm's strategy, then, is given by Pt, T (0, . . . , 0, t , t+1, . . . , T), where s is the probability of a sale in period s, t is the first period in which a sale is conducted with a positive probability, and T is the period by which a firm holds a sale with certainty. I use the term "planning horizon" to refer to the set of periods {t, t + 1, . . . , T - 1, T}. I assume that each firm commits to exactly one sale date before T; thus t + t+1 + · · · + T
1.4 In all periods before t, the firms charge the regular price.
As an illustration, in a four-period game (T 4) with the planning horizon starting in the second period (t 2), each firm chooses between three potential price paths: (1; p; 1; 1), (1; 1; p; 1) or (1; 1; 1; p). Table 1 depicts a normal form representation of this game.5
For example, the mixed strategy (0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5) represents the following action. At the start of the first period, the firm schedules its sale for the second period with probability 0.2; it schedules its sale for the third period with probability 0.3; with the remaining probability 0.5, it schedules its sale for the last period. Note that the realization of this mixed strategy is a fixed sale date in exactly one future period.
How is the ending period of the planning horizon, T, chosen? It likely depends on the specific type of promotions we are trying to model. For periodic sales by supermarkets, it is reasonable to assume that T is endogenous, optimally chosen by the firms. See the online appendix for an examination of an infinitehorizon model in which the firms choose T. The findings from this model are presented in Section 7.
Another possibility is that T is exogenous, and that the firms must hold their sales before period T. This model represents, for example, clearance sales that take place before the end of a fashion season.6 Thus, the basic set-up I examine here is the finite-horizon model with T periods. In the beginning of the first period, each firm chooses a period in which it will hold a sale. The firms maximize their ex ante expected sum of profits from all T periods. I will search for the symmetric Nash equilibria (NE) of this game.
Before solving the general version of this model, in Section 3, I present an example that captures the main issues accompanying the firms' choice of a future promotion date.

3. Illustrative Example
Here I present a simple finite-horizon example for which I explain how to compute the firms' optimal strategies and verify that there are no deviations. I normalize H to 1 and set L equal to 2/3. The regular price is 1, and the sale price is 0.5. Initially, I consider a three-period model, i.e., T 3.
In the beginning of the first period, each firm chooses a period in which to hold a sale. It is easy to show that a symmetric pure-strategy NE does not exist for these parameters of the model. Both firms cannot choose period 1 or period 2 for their sales because the demand is not large enough to support two firms holding a sale. At the same time, both firms cannot schedule a sale for period 3 since there is a profitable deviation for one of the firms to reschedule its sale for the second period. Note that a symmetric pure-strategy NE also does not exist for T > 3 since when both firms schedule a sale for the same period s > 2, each has an incentive to deviate to holding a sale in period s - 1.
Additionally, there are no asymmetric pure-strategy equilibria. First, consider the case when one firm never holds a sale and charges the reservation price every period. Then, the second firm's optimal strategy is to wait for the largest number of low-valuation consumers and hold a sale in period 3. Given this strategy, the first firm would like to deviate and schedule a sale for the second period. Thus, there are no purestrategy equilibria with one of the firms never holding a sale. Now consider the case of the firms choosing different periods for their sales. If there exists at least one extra period between the scheduled sales, a firm with the earlier sale date would like to move its sale date later, just one period before the sale date of its rival. If the sales are scheduled for consecutive periods, the firm with the later sale date attracts the minimum number of low-valuation consumers, which makes the sale unprofitable. Thus, this firm has a profitable deviation to charging the reservation price in every period. Therefore, asymmetric pure-strategy equilibria also do not exist. The same argument applies to the game with any number of periods.
In the absence of pure-strategy equilibria, we need to search for a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Note that no firm should place a positive probability on scheduling a promotion for the first period: Even if it were the only firm offering a promotion in that period, it would earn less than 1. Therefore, I will solve for the strategies of the type P2, 3 (0, 2, 1 - 2). In this equilibrium, 2 is determined in such a way that the sum of the profits from all three periods is the same regardless of whether the firm sets a sale date for period 2 or period 3. In all periods except the sale period, the firm charges the regular price and earns profit 1; therefore, it is only necessary to equate the expected profits from the periods in which the firm holds a sale. If the focal

1003

firm holds a sale in the second period, its rival offers a sale in the same period with probability 2, and the low-valuation consumers are split between the firms. With probability 1 - 2, the rival charges the regular price, and all 4/3 low-valuation consumers are cap-
tured by the focal firm. Thus, the focal firm's expected profit from a sale in the second period is 0.5(2(1 + 2/3) + (1 - 2)(1 + 4/3)) 0.5(7/3 - 22/3). If the focal firm holds a sale in the third period, its rival held a sale in the previous period with probability 2, so the focal firm captures only 2/3 new low-valuation consumers. With probability 1 - 2, the rival holds a sale in the same period and both firms get 3/3 low-valuation
consumers. Then, the focal firm's expected profit from a sale in the third period is 0.5(2(1 + 2/3) + (1 - 2) · (1 + 1)) 0.5(2 - 2/3). The profit from scheduling a sale for the second period is equal to the profit from scheduling a sale for the third period when 2 1, i.e., when both firms schedule a sale for the second period
with certainty. However, I have already established that
the firms will not follow such a strategy since each
would rather charge the regular price and sell only to
its high-valuation consumers. This means that in the
three-period model, there are no mixed strategy equilibria with the firms committing to holding a sale.7
Now consider the four-period model, i.e., T 4. I will solve for the strategies of the type P2, 4 (0, 2, 3, 1 - 2 - 3). As argued above, since the firms earn 1 in all periods in which they charge the regular price, to
solve for the mixed-strategy equilibrium it is only nec-
essary to equate the expected profits from the sale
periods. The focal firm's expected profit from holding a sale in the second period is 2 0.5(2(1 + 2/3) + (1 - 2)(1 + 4/3)) 0.5(7/3 - 22/3). If the focal firm schedules a sale for the third period, with probability 2, the rival held its sale in the previous period, so the focal firm sells to 2/3 new low-valuation consumers. With probability 3, the rival also holds a sale in the third period, so the low-valuation consumers are split, and the focal firm sells to 3/3 of them. With the remaining probability 1 - 2 - 3, the rival holds a sale in the next period, so the focal firm gets all 6/3 low-
valuation consumers. The expected profit from holding a sale in the third period is, then, 3 0.5(2(1 + 2/3) + 3(1 + 3/3) + (1 - 2 - 3)(1 + 6/3)) 0.5(3 - 42/3 - 3).
When the focal firm holds a sale in the fourth period,
if the rival held a sale in period 2, the focal firm sells to 4/3 low-valuation consumers, and if the rival held a sale in period 3, the focal firm sells to 2/3 low-valuation
consumers. If the rival also holds a sale in the fourth
period, the low-valuation consumers are split, and the focal firm sells to 4/3 of them. The expected profit from holding a sale in the fourth period is, then, 4 0.5(2(1 + 4/3) + 3(1 + 2/3) + (1 - 2 - 3)(1 + 4/3)) 0.5(7/3 - 23/3).

Equating the expected profits 2 and 4, we get 2 3. Using this equality and equating 2 and 3, we obtain 2 2/5. Thus, the solution is (0, 2/5, 2/5, 1/5). Since 2 3 4, we can use 2 to find the expected profit in a sale period: 2 0.5(7/3 - 22/3) 0.5(7/3 - 4/15) 31/30  1.03. This profit is greater than
1; therefore, the firms commit to a future sale date and
do not deviate to charging the regular price in every
period.
We must also consider whether it is possible to have
a planning horizon that starts in the third period, i.e., P3,4 (0, 0, 3, 1 - 3). The focal firm's expected profit from holding a sale in period 3 is 3 0.5(3 · (1 + 3/3) + (1 - 3)(1 + 6/3)) 0.5(3 - 3). The focal firm's expected profit from holding a sale in period 4 is 4 0.5(3(1 + 2/3) + (1 - 3)(1 + 4/3)) 0.5(7/3 - 23/3). Equating these expected profits, we obtain 3 - 3 7/3 - 23/3. Thus 3 2. This means that it is not possible to have a planning horizon starting in period 3, and the
only equilibrium strategy for the four-period model is P2,4 (0, 2/5, 2/5, 1/5).
Now consider the five-period model, i.e., T 5. First,
examine the strategies with the planning horizon starting in the second period P2,5 (0, 2, 3, 4,1 - 2 - 3 -4). The solution for this case is (0,-2/13,10/13,-1/13, 6/13), and it includes negative probabilities.8 Thus, a strategy of the type (0, 2, 3, 4,1 - 2 - 3 - 4) cannot be used by the firms. Then, the firms can consider the
planning horizon starting in the third period instead of the second period, P3,5 (0,0, 3, 4,1-3 -4). A NE that uses such strategies exists, and the equilibrium strategies are (0,0,10/17,1/17,6/17). The corresponding expected profit in the sale period is 41/341.21. Because
with these strategies the firms do not hold a sale in the
second period, it is necessary to check that they do not
have a profitable deviation to charging the sale price in
the second period. Indeed, if one firm deviates to holding a sale in the second period, it will sell to all 4/3 lowvaluation consumers and earn 0.5(1+4/3) 7/6. This is smaller than 41/34; therefore, the firms do not have an
incentive to deviate to holding a sale before the start of
the planning horizon. It is easy to verify that the strategy of the type P4,5 (0,0,0, 4,1- 4) does not exist for the five-period model; thus, the only equilibrium strategy is P3,5 (0,0,10/17,1/17,6/17).
A similar analysis of the six-period model shows that the only equilibrium strategy is P3, 6 (0, 0, 10/21, 3/12, 6/21, 2/21). It gives the firms the expected profit of 53/42  1.262 in a sale period. Next, I derive the closed-
form expressions for the equilibrium strategies in the
basic model for any exogenous T.
4. Equilibrium Strategies in the
Basic Model
In this section, I examine the outcome of a finitehorizon model with T  2 periods. In the beginning of

the first period, each firm chooses a period in which it will hold a sale. This is the only decision the firms make in this model. First, I consider the case of both firms choosing their sale periods with certainty. The set of model parameters for which a pure-strategy symmetric NE exists is established in the following lemma.9

Lemma 1. There exists a pure-strategy symmetric NE for the finite-horizon model with prescheduled sales if and only if p  H/(H + L) and T  {2, 3}. The sale is scheduled for the second period.

This lemma shows that a pure-strategy NE exists only for the two-period and the three-period models if the number of low-valuation consumers L is relatively high and/or the sale price p is large. If a purestrategy NE does not exist, it is necessary to search for the mixed-strategy NE.
Assume that there exists a symmetric mixed-strategy NE in which each firm uses the strategy Pt, T (0, . . . , 0, t , . . . , T) with a positive probability of a sale in any period in the planning horizon {t, . . . , T}. One of the requirements of this mixed-strategy NE is that a firm should be indifferent between scheduling its sale for any period between t and T. This means that the expected profits from holding a sale in any period between t and T should be equal. The following lemma shows that in this case, the sale probabilities are connected by a simple recursive formula.

Lemma 2. In any symmetric mixed-strategy NE, if a firm's expected profits in periods s and s + 1 are equal, then the sale probabilities in those periods are linked by the following recursive formula

Using (1), it is possible to express all sale proba-
bilities in terms of the sale probability in the starting period of the planning horizon, t, as shown in the following lemma.

Lemma 3. In any symmetric mixed-strategy NE, if a firm's expected profits are equal in all periods between t and T, then the sale probability in any period s  t can be defined through t as follows

It is necessary for all sale probabilities to be nonnegative. The next lemma outlines the restrictions on t that guarantee this. Conveniently, these restrictions also ensure that the firms do not have incentives to deviate from their equilibrium strategies by holding a sale in any period before t.

Lemma 4. The sale probabilities defined in are nonnegative if and only if t  0 and t  2/t. The latter restriction also ensures that the firms do not schedule a sale for any
period before t.

Equations (2) define all sale probabilities in terms of t. Because the sum of these probabilities must equal 1, it is possible to obtain the closed-form expression for t as shown in the next lemma.
Lemma 5. The sale probabilities defined in sum up to 1 if and only if the sale probability in the starting period of the planning horizon, t, is given by the following formula

Because (3) gives the closed-form expression for t, it is possible to write out the conditions from Lemma 4 (t  0 and t  2/t) in terms of t and T. These conditions are given in the next lemma and ensure that all

Inequalities (4) can be used to identify the starting period of the planning horizon. The following proposition shows that this starting period always exists and is unique.

Proposition 1. For any given T, there exists a unique value of t that satisfies the conditions of Lemma .

Taken together, we can use the following procedure to solve for the strategies that guarantee that a firms' expected payoffs from holding a sale in any period in the planning horizon are equal. For any T, one can use (4) to find the starting period of the planning horizon t. As Proposition 1 indicates, there will be only one such value of t. Then, using (3), we can find the sale probability in period t. Finally, using (2), we can find the sale probabilities in all periods. Note that these probabilities depend only on the starting and the ending periods of the planning horizon, t and T, and do not depend on the other parameters of the model, i.e., p, H, and L. Because t is uniquely determined by T, the

equilibrium strategies depend only on the number of

periods in the model, T. Table 2 shows these strategies

for T  13.

The length of the planning horizon, T - t, weakly

increases as T increases. This happens because with an

increase in T, all terms in the sum in the right-hand

side (RHS) of inequalities (4) get smaller, so more of

these terms are required for the sum to exceed 0.5.

In fact, one can evaluate the length of the planning

horizon using the following approximation: To sat-

So far, we have constructed a set of strategies that

satisfy two conditions: (1) In the beginning of period 1,

when prescheduling its sale, each firm is indifferent

between holding a sale in any period in the planning

horizon; and (2) The firms do not deviate to holding a

sale before the start of the planning horizon, i.e., before

period t.

There is another condition that must be satisfied to

ensure that there are no profitable deviations. By com-

mitting to a future sale date, the firms must earn an

expected profit of at least H per period. If this were

not the case, the firms could earn a higher profit by

charging the regular price each period and not offer-

ing any promotions. Because the firms earn exactly

H in each period in which they charge the regular

price, it is necessary to verify that the expected profit

in the sale period is at least H. The expected profit

from holding a sale is the same regardless of which

period between t and T is chosen for a promotion.

Thus, this no-deviation condition is satisfied by check-

ing, for example, that the expected profit in the starting

period of the planning horizon, t, is at least H

In the analysis below, it is convenient to normalize H to 1. Thus, we treat L as the ratio of low-valuation to

high-valuation consumers. Given that the regular price

is also 1, this normalizes the per-period profit from

charging the regular price to 1. Then, (5) can be rewrit-

ten as p(1 + tL - t(tL/2))  1, which can be further simplified to

(6)

Each strategy Pt, T has a different value for t given by (3). These values must be substituted into (6). The
restrictions imposed by inequalities (6) can be seen in Figure 1, which graphs the equations p 2/(2 + tL(2 - t)) using the values of t and t from the strategies Pt, T for T  13.
For each Pt, T, the firms will earn at least 1 during a sale period when the model parameters fall into the region above the curve p 2/(2 + tL(2 - t)). We can see from Figure 1 that 2/(2 + tL(2 - t)) decreases when T increases. This reflects the fact that it is easier for the
firms to earn a profit of at least 1 when they can sched-
ule the promotions in the later periods that reach a
larger number of low-valuation consumers. Addition-
ally, an increase in T leads to an increase in t. It is
easier for the firms to earn a profit of at least 1 when
the planning horizon starts later since there are more accumulated low-valuation consumers. In fact, since t is bounded by 1 and t increases unboundedly with T, 2/(2 + tL(2 - t)) converges to 0 as T increases. Therefore, a deviation-proof solution exists for any parame-
ters of the model as long as T is large enough.
Last, we calculate the expected per-period profit the
firms earn when they preschedule sales. The expected
profit from a period with a sale is identical for all
periods in the planning horizon; for period t, it is given in (5) as t p(H + t(tL/2) + (1 - t)tL) p(H + tL(1 - t/2)). The value of t is obtained from (3), and it does not depend on the values of p and L. The profit in all other T - 1 periods is H, so the firm's expected per-period profit is  ((T - 1)H + t)/T ((T - 1)H + p(H + tL(1 - t/2)))/T.
Not surprisingly, the value of  increases with p, i.e.,
the higher the sale price that captures the low-valuation

consumers, the greater the profits. To examine the effect of the composition of consumers on , I set the market size (i.e., number of consumers entering each period), 2H + L, to M. Then, L M - 2H. Substitute it into  to obtain  ((T - 1)H + p(H + t(M - 2H)(1 - t/2)))/T. The derivative of this profit with respect to H equals (1/T)(T - 1 + p(1 - 2t(1 - t/2))), which is greater than 0 for all strategies from Table 1 regardless of the value of p. Predictably, the firms benefit from a larger share of high-valuation consumers.
For this basic set-up, I assumed that each firm makes a decision about the timing of its sale once, in the beginning of period 1, and has no decisions to make thereafter. In Section 5, I examine how the equilibrium strategies change if the firms have the flexibility to cancel prescheduled sales.
5. Possibility of Canceling Prescheduled Sales
For the strategies in Section 4, the ex ante expected profits from holding a sale in any period in a planning horizon are identical and are larger than H. However, the realization of these strategies might lead to a firm holding an unprofitable sale that results in a profit smaller than H. For example, if a firm scheduled its sale for period s, but in period s - 1, the rival held a sale, the scheduled sale of the focal firm generates a profit of only p(H + L), which, for a large set of model parameters, is smaller than H. In that case, the firm would prefer to cancel its sale and charge the regular price in period s. In Section 2, I discussed the potential costs associated with canceling a sale. In this section, I assume that these costs are sufficiently small to allow sale cancellations.10
The timing of the model with the possibility of sale cancellations is as follows: At the start of the first

period, each firm chooses a period in which it will hold a sale. Afterwards, in any period s, each firm, after observing the price charged by the rival in this period, has an option of canceling its scheduled sale.
Take a firm that has its sale prescheduled for some period s. Consider the possibility that in period k < s, it observes that the rival firm held its sale. The focal firm now knows the exact profit from its sale in period s. There will be s - k accumulated low-valuation consumers, and the profit in that period will be p(H + (s - k)L). If this profit is less than H, the focal firm would be better off canceling its sale. The inequality p(H + (s - k)L) < H is equivalent to

s

p).

(7)

This means that if the difference between the period in which the rival held its sale and the prescheduled sale period of the focal firm is less than (H/(pL))(1 - p), the focal firm cancels its sale and charges the regular price.
Take c to be the largest integer that is smaller than (H/(pL))(1 - p). Then, a firm would cancel its sale scheduled for period s if and only if the rival held its sale within c periods of period s. The following lemma specifies the recursive formula that connects the sale probabilities:

Lemma 7. In the finite-horizon model with sale cancellations, in any symmetric mixed-strategy NE, if a firm's expected profits in periods s and s + 1 are equal, then the sale probabilities in these periods are linked by the following recursive formula

where A (H/(pL))(1 - p) and c is the largest integer satisfying c < A.11

Given the probability of a sale in the starting period of the planning horizon, t, one can express all subsequent sale probabilities in terms of it. Setting the sum of these probabilities to 1 allows us to solve for t. There is no closed-form solution for t; therefore, I numerically solve for the equilibrium strategies. After confirming
that all sale probabilities are non-negative, I verify that
the firms do not have a profitable deviation to holding a sale in period t - 1.
Unlike the equilibrium strategies in Section 4, the
strategies in the model with a possibility of sale cancellations do depend on the parameters p, L, and H.
A comparison of these strategies to the strategies from
the model without sale cancellations is easier if, instead
of analyzing the differences in the probability distribu-
tions, we examine only the change in the probability
of a sale in the starting period of the planning horizon, t. There is a negative relationship between t and the expected profit in a sale period. A larger t implies a greater probability of having a joint sale and
splitting the low-valuation consumers with the rival in period t. This decreases the expected profit from holding a sale in period t.12 Thus, to determine the effect of
sale cancellations on the expected profit, it is enough to examine the change in t.
To follow the example in Section 3, I will fix H at 1, L at 2/3, and allow p to vary. Rewrite c < (H/(pL))(1 - p) as H/(pL) > (H + cL)/L. Thus

p

<

1 cL/H

.

(9)

Consider c 1 and take the value of p just high
enough so that the firm is indifferent between charging
the regular price and holding a sale given that the rival
held a sale in the previous period. From (9), this price is 1/(1 + L/H). For this value of p, the constant A from Lemma 7 is A H(1 + L/H)/L - H/L 1. The recursive formula from (8) becomes s+1 (2/(s + 1))(1 - s-1 · 0 + s(-s/2)) (2/(s + 1))(1 - s(s/2)) 2/(s + 1) - s(s/(s + 1)). This is exactly the same recursive relationship as in (1) for the model without a possibility of sale cancellation. Therefore, the solutions for t would also be identical for these two models.
In summary, when p 1/(1 + L/H) 1/(1 + 2/3) 0.6,
the solutions for the models with and without sale can-
cellations are identical. For the values of p larger than 0.6, these models also give identical results since the
firms do not have incentives to cancel their sales even
if a rival held its sale in the previous period. Hence, the interesting case is that of p < 0.6. I will start with p 0.6 and examine what happens to t as p decreases. The equilibrium strategy in the model without sale cancel-
lations remains the same, but the strategy in the model
with sale cancellations changes. Figure 2 illustrates this change in t for the values of T between 4 and 13.13 The planning horizons used by the firms are shown in parentheses and the value of t corresponding to p 0.6 is shown by the horizontal line.
The most interesting case happens for T 5 (Fig-
ure 2(b)). For the model without sale cancellations, the planning horizon is (3; 5) and 3 is 0.59. As p decreases, the probability of 3 in the model with sale cancellations increases, eventually reaching the level at which
it becomes more profitable for the firms to deviate to
holding a sale in period 2. At this point, the firms

switch to planning horizon (2; 5). Figure 2(b) shows the value of 2 + 3 in this region. Eventually, probability 2 falls to 0, and the firms switch back to using planning horizon (3; 5). Probability 3 declines, dropping below the initial level of 3, and ultimately falling to 0, at which point the firms switch to using planning horizon (4; 5).
A similar behavior of t, where it first increases and then decreases, falling below its initial level, is present in three other cases: T 8, 11, and 12 (Figures 2(e), 2(h), and 2(i)). For T 6, t first decreases, then increases within a small region, and then decreases again, always staying below its initial level (Figure 2(c)). For the remaining five cases (T 4, 7, 9, 10, and 13), t always decreases, eventually reaching 0, at which point the firms switch to the planning horizon (t + 1, T).
In conclusion, whereas it is possible that for some model parameters, especially when p is large, allowing for sale cancellations increases t, for the majority of model parameters, t is smaller in the model with sale cancellations. This corresponds to an increased expected profit from a sale. The intuition for this result is as follows:
If a firm schedules its sale for some period toward the end of the planning horizon, it benefits by selling to more low-valuation consumers if it is the first firm to hold a sale. However, scheduling a sale for these later periods also increases the risk of holding a sale after the sale of its rival and facing fewer low-valuation consumers. If a firm can cancel its unprofitable sale, it faces a higher floor on its profit in the sale period. This decreases the potential loss from holding a sale after its rival. The firms respond by shifting probability towards the later periods of the planning horizon, which results in an increase in the expected profit.
So far, the focus here has been on the timing of promotions, with the sale price optimally set at p by both firms. In Section 6, I show how to incorporate into the framework the possibility of the firms choosing different discount levels.
6. Endogenous Sale Price
In this section, I examine how the optimal strategies change when the firms can choose different levels of promotion depth. In this version of the model, in the beginning of the first period, the firms choose not only the period in which they will hold a sale but also the sale price.
As discussed in Section 2, for the current demand structure, the firms have no incentive to reduce the sale price below p. Thus, to generate competition in prices, it is necessary to modify the demand. I assume that all low-valuation consumers have a search cost of 0, which allows them to compare the prices of both firms even if the first firm they sample charges a sale price. Consistent with prevalent empirical practice, I assume a

logit specification for the demand of the low-valuation
consumers. That is, if both firms offer sale prices pi  p and pj  p in the same period, then the share of the low-valuation consumers captured by firm i is

Pr i

e

-pi

e -pi /µ /µ + e-p

j

/µ

,

(10)

where µ is a measure of consumer heterogeneity. The firms' strategies, then, involve not only the prob-
abilities of holding a sale in any period between t and T, Pt, T (0, . . . , 0, t , t+1, . . . , T) but also the corresponding sale prices for each period in the planning horizon, (pt , pt+1, . . . , pT). Note that only one of these prices will be used for the sale prescheduled for period s  {t, . . . , T}; the regular price will be charged in all other periods.
With these strategies, the expected profit from scheduling a sale for period s can be obtained from Equation (A.1) in the proof of Lemma 2 by adding two modifications. First, the sale price is now ps instead of p. Second, (A.1) specifies that if both firms held a sale in this period, the low-valuation consumers would be split equally, with each firm capturing sL/2. Now, firm i's share depends on its price and the price of the rival and is given by (10), so firm i obtains Pri sL low-valuation consumers if both firms schedule a sale for period s.
To solve for the optimal prices and probabilities, we set up a standard system of equations. First, the expected profits from holding a sale in any period in the planning horizon must be equal to each other. In addition, we now have the first-order conditions that ensure that each sale price maximizes the expected profit from holding a sale in that period. That is, s/ps 0, unless ps p, in which case we must verify that s/ps > 0, so that neither firm has an incentive to undercut their rival. This system of equations must be solved numerically. Finally, since the objective function is not quasi-concave, we must verify that the obtained solution is a global maximum. This analysis is conducted by computing the values of the profit function for all possible sale prices between 0 and p with a grid size of 0.001 and confirming that these values do not exceed the expected profit at the solution point.
A firm gains from charging a lower sale price by increasing the number of low-valuation consumers captured by the sale if the rival also scheduled a sale for this period. On the other hand, if the rival scheduled its sale for any other period, the number of low-valuation consumers captured by the sale does not depend on the depth of the discount, so a lower sale price decreases the profit. The firms set their sale prices by balancing these two effects.
I use the example from Section 3 to illustrate how the possibility of charging different sale prices affects the optimal strategies. Recall that, in this example, the number of low-valuation consumers entering each period

is 2/3 (H is normalized to 1), and that they consider buying the product only if its price is less than or equal to p 0.5. The last equilibrium strategy computed in Section 3 was P3, 6 (0; 0; 0.48; 0.14; 0.29; 0.1). The expected profit in a sale period from using this strategy was found to be 1.262. Table 3 illustrates the optimal strategies for the planning horizon starting in period 3 and ending in period 6 for the relatively high levels of consumer heterogeneity µ. The last column in Table 3 shows the expected profit in a sale period.
When consumer heterogeneity µ is large, the preferences of low-valuation consumers are dispersed and their demand elasticity is small. Thus, when the rival schedules its sale for the same period, the focal firm does not capture many additional low-valuation consumers by decreasing its sale price below 0.5. This modest gain is outweighed by a loss from smaller revenues obtained when the focal firm is the only one to hold a sale in that period. Therefore, the firms charge the largest possible sale price that captures the lowvaluation consumers, i.e., price 0.5. Thus, for large levels of consumer heterogeneity, the equilibrium strategies in the model with the firms choosing the sale price are exactly the same as the strategies in the model with the sale price exogenously set at 0.5.
As µ decreases, the portion of low-valuation consumers captured by a decrease in a sale price increases. When the benefit from a larger demand outweighs the loss from a smaller price, the firms start charging the sale prices that are smaller than 0.5. This benefit is larger in the period with the highest sale probability since the probability of having both firms scheduling sales for that period is the greatest among all periods. Therefore, that period will be the first in which the sale price decreases. As shown by Table 3, when µ 0.045, the period with the largest sale probability is period 3, and the firms decrease this period's sale price p3 to 0.498.
At the same time, since the profitability of charging p3 decreases as this price decreases, the firms shift the sale probability away from period 3 into the later periods, which contain higher sale prices. Interestingly, this leads to an increase in the expected profit in the sale period. For example, when µ 0.035, the sale price

in period 3 drops to 0.49, but because of the change in the probability distribution P3, 6, the expected profit increases to 1.285.
For the smaller values of µ, there is a larger downward pressure on prices, and the firms start decreasing their sale prices in other periods as well. When µ reaches 0.033, the sale prices in all periods drop below 0.5. As µ decreases further, the probability distribution P3, 6 changes little, but all sale prices decrease, lowering the expected profit. In an equilibrium strategy, there is a negative relationship between the probability of a sale and a sale price. A larger probability of a sale in a period corresponds to a smaller sale price.
Eventually, the sale prices drop low enough so that the firms find it profitable to deviate to charging sale price 0.5. The reason for this deviation is illustrated by comparing the costs and benefits of charging a sale price ps < 0.5 instead of 0.5. The benefit of charging ps is that it captures one half of the low-valuation consumers if the rival holds a sale in the same period, whereas by charging 0.5 the focal firm loses a significant portion of them to its rival. The cost of charging a low sale price is that the profit from the highvaluation consumers and from the low-valuation consumers when the rival holds a sale in a different period is smaller than the profit obtained by charging 0.5. As the sale price decreases, the cost of charging ps rises, eventually leading the firms to deviate to charging 0.5.
In the example above, this happens when µ reaches 0.0324. The lowest sale price is charged in period 3, the period in which the firms can no longer use a single price p3 < 0.5 in the equilibrium. The firms also cannot charge 0.5 with certainty in period 3 as this price would be undercut. Therefore, in this period, we need to search for a mixed-strategy equilibrium in prices. Note that there are two separate mixing processes combined in one strategy: The firms mix between the periods for which they preschedule a sale and, if a sale is prescheduled for period 3, they also mix between the sale prices in that period.
Because the demand functions of the low-valuation consumers are continuous, I rely on the result from Sinitsyn (2008a) that states that for such demands, the support of the mixed-strategy equilibria is finite. The solution techniques for how to find these equilibria are described in Sinitsyn (2008b, 2009), and I use them to find the equilibrium strategies here.
When µ drops to 0.0324, in the third period, the firms choose between two possible sale prices: They charge 0.5 with a small probability and charge p3 < 0.5 with the remaining probability. As µ keeps decreasing, the probability of charging 0.5 increases. For µ 0.032, the firms charge 0.5 with probability 0.06 and 0.468 with probability 0.94. Meanwhile, the sale prices in other periods also decrease, eventually leading the firms to switch to mixed strategies in those periods as well.

In Table 4, I illustrate the firms' equilibrium strategies that involve mixing between sale prices. For each µ, P3, 6 shows the sale probabilities for all periods in the planning horizon, and ps shows the sale prices and corresponding probabilities of charging them in each period s  {3, 4, 5, 6}.
Table 4 illustrates that as µ decreases, the sale probabilities within P3, 6 change little. The pricing strategies change more significantly. A decrease in µ leads to a decrease in the lowest sale price used by the firms in each period. Eventually, the gap between this price and 0.5 becomes sufficiently large so that the firms find it profitable to deviate to charging another sale price in this gap. At this point, this new price is added to the support of the mixed-strategy equilibrium. For example, when µ 0.02, in the third period, the firms hold a sale with probability 0.39. Conditional on holding a sale, they charge 0.433 with probability 0.59, 0.489 with probability 0.06, and 0.5 with the remaining probability 0.35.
As consumer heterogeneity keeps decreasing, the firms add the third price to the support of the mixedstrategy equilibria in other periods. The last equilibrium presented in Table 4, for µ 0.015, has the firms using 3 sale prices in all periods. A further decrease in µ leads to more prices added to the equilibria. This negative relationship between consumer heterogeneity and the number of prices the firms use is a standard feature of the models of sales with heterogeneous consumers (Sinitsyn 2008b, 2009). A decrease in consumer heterogeneity also leads to a decrease in the expected profit.
In summary, introducing competition in sale prices into the framework does not affect the equilibrium strategies if the level of consumer heterogeneity is

large. For the lower levels of heterogeneity, the firms decrease the sale prices. Interestingly, a decrease in a sale price in only one of the sale periods might be accompanied by an increase in the expected profit. This happens because the firms shift the sale probability away from the earlier period with a lower sale price to the later periods with higher sale prices and more accumulated low-valuation consumers. Eventually, however, with a continued decrease in sale prices, the expected profit starts to decline. The firms switch to mixed strategies for their sale prices in the sale period. As consumer heterogeneity keeps decreasing, the sale prices the firms use and the expected profit decline.
7. Managerial Guidelines and Concluding Remarks
The methodological contribution of this paper is the development of a dynamic pricing framework that incorporates firms' commitment to future sale dates. The flexibility of this framework allows for straightforward extensions, two of which, a possibility of sale cancellations and endogenous sale prices, are examined in the paper. The qualitative findings here offer guidance to pricing managers on how to schedule sales. First, the sale dates should be unpredictable to rivals. If a sale date is known to a rival, it can offer its promotion in a previous time period, removing all accumulated lowvaluation consumers from the market. If a firm operates in an environment where sale cancellations are not too costly, it will benefit by shifting its sales towards the latter periods in the planning horizon. Finally, if a firm schedules a sale for the period in which it thinks there is a large chance of a sale by a rival, it should charge a smaller sale price in that period.

There are multiple extensions that would enrich this framework and capture additional features of price promotions. One variation is an infinite-horizon model with prescheduled sales (see the online appendix). In this model, the firms choose the starting and the ending period of the planning horizon. This extension is suitable for studying periodic sales by supermarkets in the environment where there is no natural date by which a sale must be held.
Similar to the finite-horizon model, the firms' strategies are probability distributions over the periods in which they hold a sale. After holding their prescheduled sales, the firms schedule the next one according to their equilibrium strategy. Because in this version of the model, the firms set their sale dates repeatedly, it is necessary to verify that they do not deviate to scheduling an extra sale date within the support of the probability distribution functions.
The no-deviation requirements impose intuitive restrictions on the support of the probability distribution in the infinite-horizon model. The firms would like to push the starting period back since this accumulates more low-valuation consumers and increases their profits from holding a sale; this prevents a deviation to always charging the regular price. However, as the starting period is pushed back, the incentives to deviate by scheduling a sale right before this period rise. To counter the possibility of such deviation, the firms push the ending period back as well, expanding the difference between the starting and the ending periods. This increases the expected profit from waiting until the prescheduled sale period for two reasons. First, the firms benefit from selling in the later periods with more accumulated low-valuation consumers. Second, as the probability distribution is spread over a larger number of periods, the sale probabilities in each particular period decrease. This makes it less likely that a firm schedules its sale one period after the rival's sale and must sell to the smallest possible number of lowvaluation consumers. However, the difference between the starting and the ending period cannot become too large since the firms would have an incentive to set an extra sale date between these periods.
I solve for the optimal strategies of the firms and find that for the majority of the parameters of the model, the support of the probability distribution starts between the second and the fifth period after the previous sale and ends by the 13th period. When the firms commit to a future sale date, they can increase their profits compared to the model in which the promotion decision is made in the period when the promotion is offered. For example, when the number of low-valuation consumers entering each period equals the number of high-valuation consumers, by prescheduling sales the firms can increase their per-period profits by up to 15%. Thus, in addition to being logistically necessary,

scheduling promotions in advance increases profits of the competing firms.
Another useful extension of my framework would allow the firms to schedule several sale dates in the future. In the original model and in the infinite-horizon extension, the firms can schedule only one sale at a time. In reality, firms often plan their promotions up to a year in advance, with the planning horizon including multiple sale occasions (Blattberg and Neslin 1990, Anderson et al. 2017).
The framework presented here does not consider the interactions between retailers and manufacturers. For example, trade promotions are set up jointly by manufacturers and retailers and are supposed to benefit both parties (Anderson et al. 2017). Lal and VillasBoas (1998) introduced the model of manufacturers and retailers setting price promotions in a static setting. The current framework would be enriched from the inclusion of manufacturer/retailer interactions that give rise to the decision when to promote the product.
Another avenue for future research is the introduction of strategic consumers into the model. I assumed that all consumers are myopic and immediately purchase the product when they see the price that is below their valuation. If the consumers are strategic, they are aware of the strategies the firms are using and can postpone their purchase if they think the price will be more favorable in the future (Conlisk et al. 1984, Sobel 1991, Su 2007).

Appendix Proof of Lemma 1. Assume that both firms hold a sale in period s with certainty. Then, their payoff in that period is p(H + sL/2). The firms are splitting the low-valuations consumers. If one of the firms deviates to holding a sale in the previous period, it would get all of the low-valuation consumers in that period, and its payoff would be p(H + (s - 1)L). The deviation is unprofitable when p(H + (s - 1)L)  p(H + sL/2), which simplifies to s  2. Therefore, a pure-strategy equilibrium exists only when a sale is held in the first or second period.
If a sale is held in the first period by both firms, each gets a payoff of p(H + L/2). If, instead, one of the firms deviates and schedules its sale for the second period, it would obtain a payoff of p(H + L) > p(H + L/2). This means that there is no pure-strategy equilibrium with both firms scheduling their sales for the first period.
If a sale is held in the second period by both firms, each gets a payoff of p(H + L). If T > 3, then there is a profitable deviation to rescheduling a sale for the fourth period and obtaining a higher payoff of p(H + 2L) in that period. Thus, a pure-strategy equilibrium exists only for T 2 or T 3. We

also need to check that the firms prefer to hold a sale in the second period instead of charging the reservation price. The firms obtain a higher profit from charging the sale price in the second period if p(H + L)  H. Thus p  H/(H + L).
Proof of Lemma 2. The expected profit from holding a sale in period s is calculated as follows: If the rival held a sale in some period i before period s (which happens with probability i), then there are (s - i)L low-valuation consumers accumulated in period s. If the rival holds a sale in the same period s, then sL low-valuation consumers are split equally between the firms. Finally, if the rival holds a sale in some period i after period s (which happens with probability 1 - t - t+1 - · · · - s), the focal firm sells to sL low-valuation consumers. Taken together, the focal firm's expected profit from holding a sale in period s is
s p(t (H + (s - t)L) + t+1(H + (s - t - 1)L) + · · ·
+ s-1(H + L) + s (H + sL/2)
+ (1 - t - t+1 - · · · - s-1 - s )(H + sL)). (A.1)
Similarly, the focal firm's expected profit from holding a sale in period s + 1 is
s+1 p(t (H + (s - t + 1)L) + · · · + s-1(H + 2L)
+ s (H + kL) + s+1(H + (s + 1)L/2)
+ (1 - t - t+1 - · · · - s - s+1)(H + (s + 1)L)). (A.2)
The expression for s from (A.1) simplifies to s p(H + sL - t tL - t+1(t + 1)L - · · · - s-1(s - 1)L - s (sL/2)). Similarly, s+1 from (A.2) simplifies to s+1 p(H + (s + 1)L - t tL - t+1(t + 1)L - · · · - s-1(s - 1)L - s sL - s+1((s + 1)L/2)). After equating the expressions for s and s+1, we obtain s (sL/2) + s+1((s + 1)L/2) L, thus s+1 2/(s + 1) - s (s/(s + 1)).
Proof of Lemma 3. This is a proof by induction. In period t, t t (t/t). In period t + 1, t+1 2/(t + 1) - t(t/(t + 1)) from (1). Thus, the initial conditions are satisfied. Now, we need to show that if in period s - 1, the sale probability satisfies (2), then the sale probability in s also satisfies (2). Consider two cases.
If s - 1 - t is even and s-1 t(t/(s - 1)), then using (1), s 2/s - s-1((s - 1)/s) 2/s - t(t/(s - 1))((s - 1)/s) 2/s -  t (t /s ).
If s - 1 - t is odd and s-1 2/(s - 1) - t(t/(s - 1)), then using (1), s 2/s - s-1((s -1)/s) 2/s -(2/(s -1))((s -1)/s)+ t(t/(s - 1))((s - 1)/s) 2/s - 2/s + t(t/s) t(t/s).
Proof of Lemma 4. For any period s, if s - t is even, we know from (2) that s t(t/s). Therefore, t  0 guarantees that s  0. If s - t is odd, then we know from (2) that s 2/s - t(t/s) (2 - t t)/s. Then, s  0 if 2 - t t  0, which is equivalent to t  2/t.
If a firm considers deviating and holding a sale in some period before t, it should schedule one for period t -1 to maximize the number of accumulated low-valuation consumers. Take the rival's strategy as fixed. The rival uses strategy Pt, T with the earliest possible sale occurring in period t with probability t. If the focal firm deviates and holds a sale in period t - 1, it gets all low-valuation consumers, and its profit is t-1 p(H + (t - 1)L). If the focal firm follows the strategy Pt, T and holds its sale in period t, its expected profit is

t p(t(H + tL/2) + (1 - t)(H + tL)) p(H + tL - t(tL/2)). The deviation is unprofitable if t-1  t. This inequality is equivalent to (t - 1)L  tL - t(tL/2), which simplifies to t  2/t.

Proof of Lemma 5. The probabilities in the planning horizon

have to sum up to 1. Thus, we can substitute the formulas for

s from (2) into t + t+1 + · · · + T 1. The resulting expression depends on whether T - t is even or odd. If T - t is odd, then

Now, examine the sum 1/(t + 1) + 1/(t + 3) + · · · + 1/(T - 3) + 1/(T - 1). If it is less than 1/2, then together with (A.4), the second condition of Lemma 6 (for even T - t) is satisfied and t serves as the starting period of the planning horizon.
If 1/(t + 1) + 1/(t + 3) + · · · + 1/(T - 3) + 1/(T - 1)  1/2, define t t + 1. This inequality becomes 1/t + 1/(t + 2) + · · · + 1/(T - 3) + 1/(T - 1)  1/2. Together with (A.3) rewritten as 1/(t + 1) + · · · + 1/(T - 2) + 1/T  1/2, these inequalities satisfy the first condition of Lemma 6 (for odd T - t) and t serves as the starting period of the planning horizon. This process illustrates that only one of the conditions of Lemma 6 can be satisfied; therefore, the starting period is unique.
Proof of Lemma 7. Consider periods s and s + 1, where t  s  T - 1. In the mixed-strategy equilibrium, the expected profits from holding a sale in these periods must be equal. The expected profit from a sale in period s could be decomposed into four parts. First, if the rival held its sale more than c periods in advance of s, the focal firm will proceed with its sale. The portion of the expected profit corresponding to this case is

p(t(H + (s - t)L) + t+1(H + (s - t - 1)L) + · · · + s-c-1(H + (c + 1)L)).

(A.5)

Second, if the rival held its sale within c periods of s, the focal firm would cancel its sale, charge the reservation price, and earn profit H. The portion of the expected profit corresponding to this case is

s-c H + s-c+1H + · · · + s-1H.

(A.6)

Third, if the rival also scheduled its sale for period s, both firms hold their sales at the same time and split the lowvaluation consumers. The portion of the expected profit corresponding to this case is

ps

H

+

sL 2

.

(A.7)

Finally, if the rival scheduled its sale for some period after

s, the focal firm gets all low-valuation consumers in period s.

The portion of the expected profit corresponding to this

case is

p(1 - t - · · · - s)(H + sL).

(A.8)

Combining the expressions from (A.5)­(A.8), we receive the following formula for the expected profit from scheduling a sale for period s:

s p(t (H + (s - t)L) + · · · + s-c-1(H + (c + 1)L)

+ s(H + sL/2) + (1 - t - · · · - s)(H + sL))

+ s-c H + · · · + s-1H.

(A.9)

Similarly, the formula for s+1 is

s+1 p(t (H + (s - t + 1)L) + · · · + s-c(H + (c + 1)L)

+ s+1(H + (s + 1)L/2) + (1 - t - · · · - s+1)(H + (s + 1)L))

+ s-c+1H + · · · + s H.

(A.10)

In a mixed-strategy equilibrium, s and s+1 are equal. After substituting these values from (A.9) and (A.10) into s+1 - s 0 and simplifying, we get
0 p(L + s-c (H + cL) - s-c+1L - s-c+2L - · · · - s-1L - s (H + L + sL/2) - s+1(s + 1)L/2) + s H - s-c H.
Hence, s+1pL((s +1)/2) pL + s-c(pH + pcL - H)- s-c+1pL - · · · - s-1pL - s (pH + pL + pSL/2 - H) and s+1 (2/(s + 1)) (1 + s-c(H/L + c - H/(pL)) - s-c+1 - · · · - s-1 - s (H/L + 1 + s/2 - H/(pL))). After substituting A H/(pL) - H/L, we obtain (8).

(2008) and Villas-Boas and VillasBoas (2008), which I discuss later in Section 1. 2 Pesendorfer (2002) provides empirical evidence for the assumptions and predictions of Sobel (1984) type models. 3 At the same time, both firms' marginal costs are normalized to 0. 4 The possibility of prescheduling multiple sale dates is discussed in Section 7. 5 Table 1 does not give the payoffs since its purpose is to illuminate the structure of the strategies. 6 Regardless of whether T is exogeneous or endogeneous, the choice of the starting period of the planning horizon, t, is endogenous. 7 The only equilibrium that exists for this case is the one where the firms schedule a sale for the second period with probability 1/2, a sale for the third period with probability 1/3, and with the remaining probability 1/6 do not hold a sale at all (see the online appendix for proof of this assertion). Because this mixed strategy includes the possibility of never holding a sale, its expected per-period profit is 1. I do not study such equilibria, focusing instead on those in which holding a sale dominates the strategy of always charging the regular prices. 8 This and the other equilibrium strategies presented in the rest of Section 3 were calculated using the formulas derived in Section 4. 9 All proofs are in the appendix. 10 Whereas a firm can cancel a sale, it cannot offer another sale date in the future. Allowing firms to cancel and reschedule sale dates would make the model equivalent to Sobel's (1984) contemporaneous pricing set-up. 11 If c 1, the formula is ambiguous as there are two different terms containing s-1. As can be seen from the proof of Lemma 7, the proper relationship for this case is s+1 (2/(s + 1))(1 - s-1(A - 1) + s (A - 1 - s/2)). 12 Recall that the expected profit from holding a sale in period t is equal to the expected profit from holding a sale in any period in the planning horizon. 13 The lower bound on price p in Figure 2 is 3/11 1/(1 + 4 × (2/3)), which corresponds to the case of the firms canceling their sales if the rival held a sale within 4 periods.
