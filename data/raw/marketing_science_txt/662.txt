In the last few decades, the measurement of marketing constructs has improved tremendously. Our discipline has also started to systematically catalogue our measurement knowledge in influential handbooks of marketing scales. However, at least two important issues remain. First, existing scales are often too long for administration in nonstudent samples or in applied studies. Second, existing (U.S.-developed) scales may contain items that are not informative about the underlying construct in particular countries, whereas relevant items tapping into local cultural expressions of the construct in question may be missing. To address these issues, we propose a new model that yields country-specific yet fully cross-nationally comparable short forms of unidimensional marketing scales. The procedure is based on hierarchical item response theory and optimal test design. The procedure is flexible in the sense that the researcher can specify various constraints on item content, scale length, and measurement precision. Because our procedure allows inclusion of country-specific (or "emic") items in standardized (or "etic") scales, it presents an important step toward resolving the emic-etic dilemma that has plagued international marketing research for decades.

1. Introduction
Using scientific methods of measurement, analysis, and interpretation is the foundation of marketing's claim to be a science. Consequently, it is encouraging that marketing scientists have made tremendous progress in accurately measuring marketing constructs. Much of this knowledge has been systematically collected in handbooks of marketing scales such as Bearden and Netemeyer (1999) and the series published by the American Marketing Association (Bruner and Hensel 1992, and successive volumes). The popularity of these books reflects marketing science's strong desire to use rigorously validated measurement instruments rather than ad hoc-constructed scales. Despite this significant progress, several issues remain unresolved.
First, many scales are too long to be useful for effective administration, especially in nonstudent samples

(Bergkvist and Rossiter 2007). Long scales lead to high costs of data collection and respondent fatigue, frustration, and attrition (Benet-Martínez and John 1998). Consequently, researchers have started to develop short forms of existing scales (e.g., Richins 2004, Shimp and Sharma 1987, Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1995). However, because the classical test theory techniques used to select items yield sample-dependent item characteristics, one cannot simply use item characteristics obtained in the calibration sample (e.g., factor score coefficients) to construct latent scores on future samples. Moreover, existing common practice to select high-loading items for the short form does not allow the researcher to measure particular ranges of the latent construct with more precision (e.g., high satisfaction or loyalty), even if academic insight dictates otherwise (Fraley et al. 2000, Gupta and Zeithaml 2006).

Second, most marketing scales have been developed and tested only in the United States. Various scholars have urged marketing scientists to conduct more research on an international basis (Bolton 2003, Shugan 2006, Steenkamp 2005, Winer 1998). Unfortunately, scale length becomes an even more pertinent issue as data collection costs multiply by the number of countries. The educational attainment of nonU.S. respondents is often lower, making respondent fatigue and attrition even more problematic. The rigorous, unidimensional properties of U.S. scales may not be fully upheld in other countries. Furthermore, U.S.-developed scale items may not be equally informative in other countries (Thompson 2007). Ever since Berry's (1969) seminal article, international researchers in the social sciences have argued that countryspecific ("emic") items might have to be added to or replace cross-nationally standardized ("etic") items (Aaker et al. 2001, Kumar 2000, Steenkamp 2005). Thus, valid measurement may require (some) countryspecific items, whereas cross-nationally comparable measurement requires standardized scales. This emicetic dilemma has been called "one of the major problems faced by an international marketing researcher" (Kumar 2000, p. 129).
In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology that addresses these issues. Our procedure yields country-specific short-form marketing scales, subject to researcher-specified optimization constraints such as varying measurement precision across the latent continuum. It controls for deviations from unidimensionality in specific countries by allowing for excess correlations between items. It provides a measure of fit per country and yields short-form latent scores that are comparable within countries across samples as well as between countries. Our procedure is based on a combination of two powerful psychometric tools: hierarchical item response theory (De Boeck and Wilson 2004, Johnson et al. 2006) and optimal test design methods (Van der Linden 2005).
2. A Model for the Construction of Short-Form Marketing Scales
2.1. Item Response Theory vs. Classical Test Theory for Scale Construction
Construction and evaluation of marketing scales has relied heavily on classical test theory (CTT) and its most important statistic, Cronbach's alpha, which is the lower bound on the scale's reliability (Netemeyer et al. 2003). In contrast, our model is based on item response theory (IRT) (Lord and Novick 1968). IRT has several important advantages over CTT, which will be important for our purposes. First, in CTT, measurement error is assumed to be constant across the entire range of the latent trait. In IRT,

measurement error is allowed to vary across levels of the underlying construct. Second, in CTT, reliability is a joint property of all items in the scale and the particular individuals sampled. When items are added to or dropped from a scale in CTT, the usefulness of the other items to the quality of the scale will change. In IRT, items are posited to contribute independently to measurement precision. When measurement precision is not sufficiently accurate at certain levels of the construct, items can be added that increase the precision at those levels.
Third, in CTT, reliability estimates vary across samples because it is a function of sample homogeneity. In IRT, measurement precision of items is theoretically invariant across samples. Finally, to allow comparisons among respondents, CTT dictates that all respondents answer all items.1 IRT has item-free calibration, which implies that respondents who have answered different questions can still be compared provided that the items have all been calibrated on a common scale and are stored in an item bank that contains the item parameters describing the items. The unique, item-free calibration feature of IRT will be of paramount importance for constructing country-specific scales while retaining cross-national comparability.

2.2. A Graded Response IRT Model for Cross-National Research
Our point of departure is a unidimensional set of Likert items, arguably the standard scale format for marketing scales (Bearden and Netemeyer 1999). The most suitable IRT model for such data is Samejima's (1969) graded response model. de Jong et al. (2007) extended the Samejima (1969) model to a multicountry setting. Their model can be written as

Pr Xigk = c =

where country is indexed by g, respondent is indexed
by i i = 1 Ng), item is indexed by k k = 1 Kg), response option is indexed by c c = 1 C),

1 In theory, different respondents could rate different subsets of items. Each element of the covariance matrix is based on those respondents with complete data for the pair of items. However, CTT researchers caution against this as it is prone to serious psychometric problems (e.g., nonpositive definite matrices and standardized covariances exceeding unity) (Bollen 1989).

and · is the standard normal cumulative distribu-

tion function. Equation (1) represents the probability

of choosing a particular response category as a func-

tion of the underlying latent trait and the item param-

eters. Equation (2) implies that each scale threshold

is

modeled

as

an overall mean threshold k c plus a country-specific

deviation. Analogously, Equation (3) posits that the

discrimination parameter agk is the sum of an overall

mean discrimination parameter and country-specific

deviation. The discrimination parameter should be

positive. Hence, negatively worded items should be

reverse coded before applying the model. The latent

trait for respondent i in country g is sampled from

the country average

g with variance

2 g

.

The

country

average is drawn from a distribution with average

and variance 2.

2.3. Incorporating Emic Items The model proposed by de Jong et al. (2007) is only applicable to standardized ("etic") scales. However, valid measurement in different countries may require that existing scales are modified to different country-cultural contexts (Aaker et al. 2001, Burgess and Steenkamp 2006). The question is how to compare country scores if a scale contains both etic and emic items.
One way to address this issue is to use the IRT model proposed by May (2006) in a cross-national context. May's (2006) model allows researchers to collect different items in different countries as long as there are also common items. However, his model requires that measurement invariance be imposed for the common items. In settings with many countries, invariance is unlikely to be satisfied for any item (Baumgartner 2004).
We propose a different solution by extending the structure displayed in (2) and (3). Our solution allows for country-specific items without requiring any item to be invariant. The formulation becomes

where is the set of etic items and g is the set of emic items unique to country g. For country-specific
items, we impose a vague lognormal prior on the dis-
crimination parameter (i.e., a and Va are chosen so that the prior is vague). A uniform prior is chosen
for the threshold parameters subject to inequality

constraints (Johnson and Albert 1999). The number of items can vary across countries. It is necessary to have etic items to calibrate the model, but these common items do not have to be invariant across countries.

2.4. Accounting for Deviations from

Unidimensionality

Thus far, we have assumed that the set of items

is unidimensional. Unidimensionality refers to the

requirement that one latent construct can account

for the covariation between the items (Gerbing and

Anderson 1988). However, excess covariation between

items is not uncommon even for established scales

because of, for example, scale length or item wording

(Baumgartner and Steenkamp 2006). Cross-national

research adds additional sources of excess covariation

such as cultural variations and issues in translation

(Kumar 2000, Thompson 2007). We allow for subsets

of items to exhibit residual dependencies, conditional

on the latent substantive trait, by including person-

where dkg indicates the subset of item k in country g (it is assumed that there are Dg subsets in country g).

The subset selection parameter is indexed by coun-

try, which implies that the subsets of items exhibit-

ing excess covariation need not be the same across

countries. The variance of the testlet effects is allowed

to vary across subsets and countries. Normally, most

items have zero excess correlations, they are independent conditional on

The additional parameters are formulated as a devi-

ation from a person's trait value so that there is a

systematic increase or decrease in the trait value for

the items in the same subset:

.

The

parameter affects all items in the subset and dis con-

stant across the subset, so that the residual dependen-

cies among the items are incorporated (Bradlow et al.

1999, Wang et al. 2002).

2.5. Estimation and Fit Identification requires that mean and variance of the latent scale be fixed in every country. Both a uniform shift in threshold parameters in Equations (6) and (8) as well as a shift in the latent mean in Equation (4) can capture the country mean of the latent scale. Similarly, for the variance, we can uniformly shift the discrimination parameters in Equations (7) and (9) as well

as the latent variance in Equation (4). To identify the model, we impose

(12)

The model is estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Estimation details are given in the appendix. Model fit has traditionally received relatively little attention in IRT. However, in a cross-national context in which the scale is administered in various languages to different cultures, the extent to which the IRT model fits the data in each country becomes especially pertinent. We will consider overall fit as well as the fit of specific aspects of the model.

2.5.1. Overall Fit. If an IRT model fits the data, the distribution of posterior scores should overlap with the distribution of the observed sum scores (Béguin and Glas 2001). The observed scores of all persons and items are stored in the matrix X and all model parameters are stored in the vector . In each MCMC iteration after the burn-in phase, a new replicated data set, Xrep, is generated using the current draw of the parameters. The posterior predictive distribution of replicated data is

p Xrep X = p Xrep p X d

(13)

where p X  p X p is the posterior of all parameters in the model and p is the prior of all model parameters. Next, in each country, a frequency distribution of the sum scores is calculated for the replicated data (Béguin and Glas 2001). The posterior predictive score distribution is computed as the mean of the generated frequency distributions over iterations.
Another useful overall fit statistic is the deviance information criterion (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002). It can be used to compare different models such as models that impose versus relax cross-national constraints on item parameters. The model with the lowest expected deviance has the highest posterior probability.

2.5.2. Fit of Specific Model Components. The fit

of specific aspects of the model can be evaluated

via a Bayesian residual analysis. A Bayesian resid-

ual is defined as the difference between the observed

response Pr Xigk =

and the expected response, rigk = Xigk -

C c=1

c

·

c . In each iteration, Bayesian residuals are

computed using the sampled values of the model

parameters given the data. The computed sequences

of Bayesian residuals can be considered to be draws

from their marginal posterior distributions. A dis-

crepancy measure Q X is a function of the residu-

als and can be used in a posterior predictive check.

For instance, to check item fit, squared residuals

across persons for a particular item can be moni-

tored (i.e., Q X =

ng i=1

rigk

2).

To

identify

items

that

cause deviations from unidimensionality in a partic-

ular country (i.e., residual local dependencies), the

conditional covariance between Bayesian residuals

concerning two items given the person parameters

can be calculated. That is, let rk X denote the vector of residuals for item k given the data and

the person parameters. Subsequently, the covariance

between two vectors of item residuals is denoted

as k k X = cov rk X rk X , which can be computed within each iteration of the MCMC algo-

rithm using the expected a posteriori estimate for the

person parameters. The functions based on the resid-

uals would then be used as a discrepancy measure in

a posterior predictive check:

P Q Xrep  Q X X = I Q Xrep  Q X p Xrep X dXrep (14)

2.6. Item Information Functions Measurement accuracy in IRT is based on the notion of information. The information function I is defined as I = -E 2/ 2 ln L x . The category information function Ikgc is defined as (Samejima 1969)

Ikgc

g i

=

Pr xigk = c / Pr xik = c

2

g i

2

-

2 Pr xigk = c / Pr xigk = c

(15)

These functions can be merged to yield the item information function Ik :

Pr xigk = c /

Pr xigk = c

(16)

For widely spaced thresholds, the resulting information function might be multimodal, whereas closer thresholds produce unimodal information functions. Closer thresholds provide more information over a smaller range of the ability scale than do more widely spaced thresholds. Finally, the amount of information increases as the number of categories increases (Samejima 1969, Ostini and Nering 2005).
The scale information function (SIF) is the sum of the item information functions Ik . It is a nonlinear function of the latent variable (Fraley et al. 2000). The SIF has various features that we will use in designing optimal short-form scales. First, when measurement precision is not sufficient at certain levels of the latent variable, items can be added that provide the most information around these levels. Second, measurement precision is not the same for each level of

de Jong et al.: Model for the Construction of Country-Specific Yet Internationally Comparable Short-Form Marketing Scales

678

the latent variable. Items are most informative when the average threshold more or less matches a respondent's value. Third, the amount of information for a test is a linear function of the item information functions, which allows for the application of linear programming techniques in the construction of linear test forms (Van der Linden 2005) and computer-adaptive tests (Dodd et al. 1995, Van Rijn et al. 2002). Note the similarity between this use of information in IRT and adaptive conjoint techniques (Toubia et al. 2003, 2004), adaptive idea screening (Toubia and Florès 2007), and with the literature in educational measurement on assigning greater weights around cut scores (Bradlow and Wainer 1998, Ip 2000).

2.7. Optimal Short Forms The process of selecting items for a short-form scale, subject to various constraints with some target information function for the measure, can be formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem. In the psychometric literature, test construction using optimization is known as optimal test design (OTD) (Van der Linden 2005). OTD requires one to specify a target information function (TIF). TIF is a function that provides the goal values for L grid points l along the scale. For instance, the goal might be to select those items that yield uniformly good measurement with information level Iunif along the trait range (Fraley et al. 2000). If the researcher is primarily interested in high measurement precision at low ( lo) and high values ( hi) of the latent variable, a bimodal target function is most appropriate. The specification of different shapes of the TIF allows much more flexibility than in CTT where only Cronbach's alpha is usually considered (Hambleton et al. 1991).
The researcher needs to specify the shape of the TIF as well as the target information level attained by the short form. The standard cutoff for Cronbach's alpha is 0.7. Although this cutoff was developed in the context of CTT, it is a generally accepted criterion that we also adopt in our IRT context. Reliability and information level are related as follows:

MRIg =

2 g

-

1/

g

2

(17)

g

where

2 g

is

the

variance

in

country

g

(see

Equa-

tion (4)) and g is the required level of information in

country g. Based on Equation (17), we can compute

what information level g is required to yield short-

form scale reliability of, say, at least 0.7.

The TIFs that we consider are smooth functions.

Therefore, it holds that if we require a TIF to meet

a smooth target at one point on the latent scale,

neighborhoods approximate the target as well. Speci-

fying only a small number of grid points thus suffices

in normal applications. To assemble the scale with

an information function that meets a target, we have a multiobjective assembly problem (Van der Linden 2005, Van der Linden and Boekkooi-Timminga 1989, Veldkamp 1999).
Information functions are subject to uncertainty as a result of the uncertainty in the estimation process. Using the posterior means for the information functions based on the MCMC algorithm implies that some of the information functions are overestimated, whereas for other items, the information functions are underestimated. This might have serious consequences. In the test assembly process, items are selected based on the contribution to the test information function. Thus, item selection might capitalize on positive estimation errors if this uncertainty is not taken into account. Because of this, we implemented a robust optimization method (Ben-Tal and Nemirovski 1998, 1999, 2000).
The ultimate goal of robust optimization is to take data uncertainty into account already at the item selection stage to "immunize" resulting tests against this uncertainty. In robust optimization, constraints will be satisfied whatever the realization of the uncertain (i.e., estimated) parameters within a reasonable prescribed uncertainty set. Our robust optimization procedure is formulated as follows:

k g,

is the uncertainty set. To define the uncertainty set,

credibility intervals of the information functions can

be applied. Finally, for a relatively small number

of decision variables (i.e., number of items in the

pool < 15), it suffices to use a cubic norm instead of

a 95% reliability ellipsoid, and linear programming

techniques can be applied instead of nonlinear ones.

Additional constraints can be added to the multiob-

jective assembly problem. For instance, the constraint

Dg would from each block

specify of items

that display excess correlations (it is assumed that

there are Dg blocks of items with residual correla-

tions in country g). It could be desirable for a short-

form scale not to display residual correlations. When

there are content constraints (e.g., a certain number of

items of a certain type are needed), this can be accom-

modated by adding constraints to the optimization

model. In educational testing, there are strict demands on deviations from the target, but in marketing, overshooting in terms of information at a particular grid point is not an issue because MRI of 0.7 is a minimum rather than an optimum.
2.8. Using the Short Form in Future Research After the model has been calibrated and new data are collected for the "optimal" items, respondents who would answer completely different items can be compared within and across countries. The itemfree calibration property of IRT models ensures that respondents can answer different items and still be compared as long as the items have been calibrated on the same latent scale. Because in the first step all items are simultaneously calibrated on the same latent scale, this assumption is satisfied.
Handbooks of marketing scales could start reporting short-form scales of existing marketing instruments along with their discrimination and threshold parameters. Estimating the latent scores can be done via conditional maximum likelihood (see Hambleton and Swaminathan 1985, Chapter 5) or via Bayesian estimation, where the item parameters are simply fixed.
In summary, the procedure starts at T0 by estimating the hierarchical IRT model and selecting the optimal items. Once the optimal items are identified and their item parameters estimated, if at a later point in time (T1) new data are collected, researchers need only to collect data for these short-form items. Latent construct scores for the new sample can be estimated using respondents' scores on the optimal items and the item parameter estimates obtained in T0. Given that IRT parameter estimates are sample invariant, latent construct scores can be compared with latent scores obtained in previous samples within and across countries. This practice is consistent with the item banking literature in psychometrics (see Van der Linden 2005).
2.9. Comparison with Other Models Our model allows for country-specific subsets of correlated items and a different number of items per country, accommodates etic as well as emic items, relaxes the constraint of measurement invariance, allows construction of short-form scales subject to a variety

of researcher-imposed criteria, and enables marketing researchers to compare short-form latent scores across samples within and across countries. In Table 1, we contrast our model with previous multigroup polytomous IRT models as well as with the multigroup ordinal confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) model (Browne 1984) and the multigroup metric model (Jöreskog 1971). Table 1 is self-explanatory, but we will briefly elaborate on the differences between the present model and three major alternatives, namely, the multigroup IRT model developed by de Jong et al. (2007), and the off-the-shelf, multigroup ordinal and metric CFA models, all of which are included in popular software packages like LISREL and EQS.
Our model contributes over and above the de Jong et al. (2007) model in four important ways. Our procedure allows for emic items while retaining cross-national comparability. Thus, it addresses the emic-etic dilemma that has haunted international researchers in marketing and other social sciences ever since Berry's (1969) seminal article. It can also accommodate data sets that are less well behaved in some countries. It allows assessment of model fit per country. Finally, it contains a procedure for the selection of optimal short-form scales--subject to a flexible set of user-imposed constraints and targets--that yield cross-nationally comparable latent scores even when the items are different across countries.
Our model also differs in important respects from multigroup metric (Jöreskog 1971) and ordinal (Browne 1984) CFA models. Both multigroup CFA models require at least two invariant items to set the metric of the latent construct (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998). Often there will be no invariant items. (Indeed, our empirical application below shows that even for a well-established scale, there are no items that are invariant across countries.) Neither model can accommodate mixtures of country-specific and common items. Item characteristics are sample dependent. Therefore, item banking is not possible, which prohibits comparisons across samples within and between countries.
Ordinal CFA has two other limitations. Scalar invariance cannot be tested, as it is inadmissible to

de Jong et al.: Model for the Construction of Country-Specific Yet Internationally Comparable Short-Form Marketing Scales

680

Marketing Science 28(4), pp. 674­689, © 2009 INFORMS

compute means on ordinal data (Green et al. 1988, p. 244). Hence, latent means cannot be compared across countries (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998). Moreover, ordinal CFA typically requires samples exceeding 1,000 per country (Flora and Curran 2004)--which is considerably larger than most sample sizes in marketing research. On the other hand, metric CFA assumes the data to be interval scaled. If this assumption is incorrect, this may lead to invalid conclusions regarding measurement invariance (Lubke and Muthén 2004).
Researchers appear to weigh the limitations of the multigroup ordinal CFA more heavily than the limitations unique to its metric counterpart. Consequently, metric CFA is the method of choice in marketing (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998) and other social sciences (Raju et al. 2002, Vandenberg and Lance 2000).
3. Simulation Studies
3.1. Mixed Emic-Etic Scales The purpose of the first simulation study is to assess the ability of our cross-national IRT model to recover parameter estimates in the presence of emic items across two levels of etic versus emic items. Data were generated with 10 countries, 12 items per country, and 1,000 respondents per country. Each item is measured on a five-point Likert scale. In the condition with a low number of emic items, 3 out of 12 items were country-specific, the other 9 items being common across countries. In the condition with a high number of emic items, 8 out of 12 items were emic and the other four items were etic. In neither condition was any of the etic items invariant across countries.
We used 20,000 burn-in iterations and overdispersed starting values. The next 20,000 iterations were used for inference. The discrimination and threshold parameters are recovered accurately. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) for the discrimination parameters is 0.047 (0.048) for three (eight) emic items, and the MAD for the threshold parameters is 0.062 (0.066) for three (eight) emic items.
Table 2 shows the ability of the model to recover true latent means and variances, even in the presence of emic items. MAD for country means is 0.018 (0.022) for three (eight) emic items, which is very small given the range of the latent variable. The within-country standard deviation of the latent scores was also recovered well, MAD being 0.023 (0.027) for three (eight) emic items. Recovery is accurate even when the clear majority of the items are emic, and there is not a single cross-nationally invariant item.
3.2. Lack of Unidimensionality In the second simulation study, we examined the ability of our cross-national IRT model to recover parameter estimates for a longer scale (20 items) with some

badly behaving items (is especially common among longer scales) using a sample size (N = 500 per country) that is more typical for marketing research. In 3 out of 10 countries, the first six and the last five out of the 20 items were given excess correlations via Equations (10) and (11). The method factor variance was set equal to 75% of the latent variable variance.
As expected, in the countries with excess correlations, the posterior predictive check based on the conditional covariance between Bayesian residuals flagged problems and indicated the sources of the lack of fit (the posterior p-values were zero or one). When two testlet factors are included, model fit improves dramatically. Next, our IRT model is estimated with testlet factors for the three "offending" countries. Item parameters, country means, country variances, and method factor variances are appropriately estimated. MAD for the discrimination (threshold) parameters is 0.076 (0.107), which is a bit higher than it was because of the smaller sample size and larger number of items. The 95% credible interval of the testlet variance 0 82 1 01 includes its true value of 0.96. The true and estimated country means and variances are accurately recovered as well (see Table 3), MAD being 0.042 and 0.027, respectively.
Finally, we examine the fit of our IRT model. In Figure 1, we plot the observed and replicated sum scores for one country with error correlations (country 2) and one country without error correlations (country 9). The

4. Empirical Application
4.1. Susceptibility to Normative Influence There is a resurgent interest in social influences on consumer decision making (Bohlmann et al. 2006, Yang and Allenby 2003, Yang et al. 2006). The dominant measure for consumers' susceptibility to normative influences (SNI) is the unidimensional, eight-item scale developed by Bearden et al. (1989). It measures the predisposition to being influenced by others when making purchase decisions. This scale has been used successfully to study social influences on various aspects of consumer behavior such as attitudes toward brands (Batra et al. 2000), consumer confidence (Bearden et al. 1990), protective selfpresentation efforts (Wooten and Reed 2004), purchase of new products (Steenkamp and Gielens 2003), and consumer boycotts (Sen et al. 2001). The items of the SNI scale are listed in Table 4.
4.2. Data Collection Although our model allows for both country-specific as well as common items, data were only collected for the eight original items. Two global marketing research agencies collected data in 28 countries around the world (see Table 5 for the countries). The samples were drawn so as to be broadly representative of the total population in terms of region, age, education, and gender. Some countries used a Web survey, others a mall intercept or hard copy surveys. The number of respondents per country was in the range of 400­600, except for the United States, where the sample size was much larger sample (n = 1 181). This allows us to do rigorous validation analyses in the United States.
The SNI items were translated into local languages by professional agencies using backtranslation. All items were measured on a five-point Likert scale. We randomly dispersed the SNI items throughout the questionnaire. Bradlow and Fitzsimons (2001)

have noted that randomization may reduce reliability. However, low reliability was not an issue in our study because in all countries, Cronbach's alpha exceeded 0.70.
5. Results
5.1. Estimation We estimated the hierarchical IRT model and examined both overall fit and the fit of specific aspects of the model. To assess unidimensionality of the SNI scale, we used the posterior predictive check based on the conditional covariance between Bayesian residuals concerning two items given the person parameters. In Russia and Japan, the posterior p-values indicated that there is a large residual error correlation between items 1 and 4 (both posterior p-values equal 1.0). No such lack of fit was identified for the other countries.
Next, we reestimated the hierarchical IRT model, specifying a testlet parameter between items 1 and 4 for Russia and Japan via Equation (10). In both countries, the variance component for the testlet factor is highly significant, validating that the excess correlation identified by posterior predictive checks indeed needs to be included in the IRT model. In Japan, the posterior mean testlet variance is 0.614 (standard deviation = 0 087), whereas in Russia, it is

0.459 (standard deviation = 0 091). As an additional-- omnibus--test across all 28 countries, the model with and without the two testlet parameters can be compared using the deviance information criterion (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002). The deviance information criterion for the model without a testlet both for Japan and Russia is 217,645 versus a deviance information criterion of 217,467 for the less restrictive model. The IRT model achieved good overall fit in all countries. For illustrative purposes, Figure 2 shows the plot for one country where the SNI scale was clearly unidimensional (United States) and for a country where items 1 and 4 had excess correlation (Russia).
Table 5 presents the posterior means of the discrimination parameters. There is substantial variation in the discrimination parameters (posterior mean standard deviation is 0.185) across countries. The deviance information criterion of the model is 217,467 compared to 240,551 for a model with invariant discrimination parameters. The variation in discrimination parameters indicates that items measuring a construct well in one country are not always

useful in other countries.2 To illustrate this, consider the United States and the Ukraine. The estimated discrimination parameter of item i1 has a posterior mean of 0.781 (1.325) in the United States (Ukraine). Thus, although the item seems suited to measure SNI in the Ukraine, its posterior mean in the United States is relatively low to be a useful item. When we take the thresholds into account, this is clearly visible in the item information functions. For the United States, the posterior means of the thresholds are US 1 = -1 225, US 2 = 0 420, US 3 = 1 391, and
US 4 = 2 938, whereas in the Ukraine, the posterior values are UKR 1 = -0 611, UKR 2 = 0 519, UKR 3 = 1 532, and UKR 4 = 3 262.
Together with the discrimination parameters, this yields the posterior mean information functions for item i1 in the United States and the Ukraine plotted in Figure 3. The figure shows that (1) measurement precision varies along the latent scale, (2) the information function for the United States is much flatter because of the lower discrimination parameter, and (3) along most of the trait range, the information conveyed by item i1 is much higher in the Ukraine.
The 28 × 8 × 4 = 896 threshold parameters cannot be meaningfully displayed for all other items and countries. The findings of varying thresholds are robust across items. Concordant with the observation of fluctuation in discrimination parameters, there is substantial variation in threshold parameters (posterior mean standard deviation is 0.314).
Table 6 reports the country means and variances, ranked from low to high.3 China and Taiwan score the highest on SNI. These countries rate high on

2 The threshold parameters are also important when considering the usefulness of items. An item with moderate discrimination parameters may sometimes be better than an item with high discrimination and threshold values that do not match the position of the scale where more accurate measurement is required (see Lord and Novick 1968).
3 Note that the negative numbers primarily have to do with the scaling of the latent variable via the item parameters.

cultural collectivism, which emphasizes interdependent selves and the importance of social relations (Hofstede 2001). Also, the latent variance in SNI is low in these countries, indicating a relatively high degree of homogeneity with respect to susceptibility to normative influences.
The United States and several European countries rate lowest on SNI. People from these countries take the opinions of others on average relatively less into account when making purchase decisions. This may explain why social influences have been relatively understudied in marketing science. After all, most academic research is done in the United States and Western Europe (Stremersch and Verhoef 2005), and social influences play a relatively more modest role in these areas of the world. However, the large latent variance in these countries reveals considerable heterogeneity around the (low) mean. Even in these countries, there are segments of consumers that are clearly susceptible to normative influences, as evidenced by recent work by Bohlmann et al. (2006), Yang and Allenby (2003), and Yang et al. (2006).
5.2. Comparison with the Benchmark Metric CFA Model
It is useful to compare the results of our model to the benchmark multigroup metric CFA model. After all, it is the model of choice in marketing and other social

sciences. Initial estimation of the configural invariance model specifying the same factor structure in all 28 countries revealed a large excess correlation between items 1 and 4 in Russia and Japan. This replicates the findings obtained with the posterior predictive checks for our IRT model. We reestimated the model, specifying correlated errors between items 1 and 4 in these two countries. The overall fit for this configural model is good: 2 558 = 1 965 4, RMSEA = 0.074, CFI = 0.978, and TLI = 0.968, where RMSEA is the root mean square error of approximation, CFI is the comparative fit index, and TLI is the Tucker-Lewis index. Moreover, all factor loadings are significant and substantial in all countries. Thus, configural invariance is supported (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998).
However, substantive interest typically focuses on cross-national comparisons of latent means and variances, which require metric and scalar invariance (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998). Imposing metric and scalar invariance leads to a significant decrease in fit: 2 378 = 3 251 2, p < 0 001. The alternative fit indices also deteriorated substantially. Importantly, the decline in CFI was -0.046. In an extensive simulation study, Cheung and Rensvold (2002) found that CFI is among the most powerful fit indices to distinguish between valid and invalid cross-group constraints. They concluded that if CFI declines by more than 0.01, the null hypothesis of invariance should be rejected (Cheung and Rensvold 2002, p. 251). Furthermore, RMSEA and TLI, which take both model fit and parsimony into account, also deteriorated substantially rather than improved: RMSEA = 0 028, and
TLI = -0 025. A close inspection of the CFA results indicates that the modification indices are always large in a number of countries for each item. This implies that not a single item exhibited invariant loadings and intercepts across all countries. Hence, the well-known metric CFA model cannot be used in the current setting to compare latent means and variances across countries. Note that this setting provides a strong test as SNI is among the best-developed and validated marketing scales. If for such a scale substantive comparisons across countries are problematic, this does not bode well for less-established scales.
5.3. Deriving a Country-Specific Short-Form Version of the SNI Scale
Previous work on susceptibility to normative influences suggests that the entire continuum of social influences from low to high is of interest to marketers (Bearden et al. 1989). Consequently, a uniform specification for the TIF is most appropriate (Fraley et al. 2000). Given the cross-national variation in latent construct variance (see Table 6), we should use a

different for every country to ensure short-form reliability above 0.7 in each country. Per country, three grid points are chosen along the -scale. Next, we run the robust optimization program (Equation (18)) using GAMS 2.50. For Japan and Russia, a constraint is specified that it is not possible to select both items 1 and 4. We present the selected items in Table 7.
It can be seen that there is variation in item selection across countries, although items i1 through i3 are not often selected. Interestingly, there are no items that are selected in all countries (even though items 5, 7, and 8 come close), which indicates that a particular item is not equally informative across countries. This calls into question the usual procedure to construct (ad hoc) short-form scales in international marketing research by selecting those items that exhibit high factor loadings in the country where the scale has been developed (e.g., Batra et al. 2000, Ter Hofstede et al. 1999). Using the same short-form items across countries is not optimal, but this procedure is understandable as no short-form scale construction method to date has been able to calibrate items on the same latent scale.
Another interesting finding is that the number of items differs across countries. Thus, the required measurement precision is reached more easily in some countries than in others. For example, all items are required in China and Taiwan, whereas much fewer

items are necessary for most other countries. The reason is that Asian countries have a low latent variable variance (see Table 6), so it is harder to discriminate among respondents in these countries. In such cases, items are needed that discriminate between respondents in the latent zone where almost all respondents are located.
5.4. Validation of Short-Form Scale A question that arises in the construction of shortform scales is how well it approximates the latent scores based on the full scale. In examining this issue, we focus on the United States, where we have a much larger sample (N = 1 181). We perform the following steps:
Step 1. Estimate the model based on a random subset of 50% of the respondents and simultaneously derive the optimal short-form scale based on this estimation sample.
Step 2. Compute latent construct scores for the respondents in the holdout sample, using their scores on the short-form items and model parameters as obtained in the estimation sample.
Step 3. Estimate the model based on the holdout sample using all items.
Step 4. Correlate the short-form scores (Step 2) with the full-scale scores (Step 3) and compute the MAD between both sets of scores.
The posterior means of the discrimination parameters for items i1 to i8 in the estimation sample are 0.815, 0.880, 0.580, 1.107, 1.352, 1.011, 1.259, and 1.306. They are very similar to the discrimination parameters for the United States reported in Table 5, the MAD being 0.031. For the short-form scale, we select the same three items as for the full U.S. sample. This short form is used to score the individuals in the holdout sample. The correlation between short-form scores and full-scale scores in the holdout sample is 0.947 (p < 0 001). Hence, deleting over 60% of the items leads to a loss of only 10% in information. The MAD of the latent scores is 0.270, which is encouraging given that the total scale range is 2.28.
We conducted additional validation analyses in two other countries with relatively larger samples-- Germany (N = 640) and Ireland (N = 552). The smaller sample sizes in Germany and Ireland required us to use the full sample rather than the holdout sample in Step 3. In both countries, 400 randomly drawn observations were used for model calibration, and the other respondents served as the holdout sample. In Germany, the short-form scale consists of four items. Here, the correlation between the two sets of latent scores is 0.961 (p < 0 001), whereas the MAD of the latent scores is 0.216. In Ireland, we obtained a four-item scale, a correlation of 0.952 (p < 0 001), and a MAD of 0.224. Thus, the short form approximates

the latent scores based on the full scale well, even for smaller samples.
5.5. Validation for Simulated Emic-Etic Version of SNI Scale
A limitation of our empirical study is that we did not have emic items. Although in §3.1 we showed that our procedure can accurately recover parameter estimates in the presence of emic items, it is also useful to assess model performance for combined emicetic scales with real data. To address this issue, we conducted two validation studies in which we simulated the combined emic-etic condition. It is possible to construct an unbalanced data set with emic and etic items if we purposefully delete some items in particular countries. The key question is whether we can properly estimate the parameters of emic items, which are not available in all countries. Note that in the subsequent optimization procedure, it does not matter whether an item is etic or emic. The only thing that matters in country-specific optimization is the marginal posterior distribution of the item information function.
5.5.1. Validation with Simulated Emic Items for the United States. We designated items i5 and i8 as specific to the United States, whereas the other six items are common across all countries. This mimics the condition that not all U.S.-developed items may be relevant in other countries. Thus, a data set is constructed with six etic items in all countries, except for the United States, where two emic items are included as well. We estimate a model based on this data set and compare the item parameters for the emic items in the United States with the item parameters from §5.1. The posterior mean discrimination parameters in Table 5 were 1.342 and 1.314. With the unbalanced data set, the posterior mean estimates are very close: 1.322 and 1.319, respectively. Similarly, the eight estimated threshold parameters resemble those from §5.1, the MAD being only 0.082. The correlation between short-form scores and full-scale scores in the holdout sample is 0.947 (p < 0 001). The correlation between scores based on the simulated emic-etic scale and the original data (§5.1) is 0.979 (p < 0 001).
5.5.2. Validation with Simulated Emic Items for the Asia-Pacific Region. Previous research has suggested that the Asia-Pacific region may have specific expressions and items that are unique to this region (e.g., Burgess and Steenkamp 2006, Hofstede 2001). To simulate this condition, we conducted a second validation study. We assumed that six items are common to all countries but that items i2 and i7 are specific to the four Asia-Pacific countries (Japan, China, Thailand, and Taiwan). We estimate a model based on this data set and compare the item parameters for the emic items with the item parameters

from §5.1. We find that the discrimination parameters for the emic items closely resemble the results reported in §5.1. Pooled across the Asian countries and items, the MAD is a low 0.039. Thresholds for the emic items were also close to the results reported earlier, the MAD being 0.085. The correlation between scores based on the simulated emic-etic scale and the original data is 0.955 (p < 0 001).
6. General Discussion
In the last few decades, measurement of marketing constructs has improved tremendously. Our discipline has started to systematically catalogue our measurement knowledge in handbooks of marketing scales. However, several important issues remain. Existing scales are often too long for effective administration in nonstudent samples. Commonly used CTT statistics depend on the sample and the set of items considered, which precludes item banking. Existing common practice to select high-loading items for the short form does not allow the researcher to measure particular ranges of the latent construct with more precision, even when called for by theory. International research adds additional complications as rigorous (U.S.-developed) scales may exhibit excess correlations between items, items may not be equally informative in other countries, items may not be invariant, and relevant items tapping into local cultural expressions of the construct in question cannot be incorporated if cross-national comparisons are desired.
To address these issues, we propose a new model based on a combination of two powerful psychometric tools: hierarchical item response theory and optimal test design methods. Our procedure can be used to construct a short-form marketing scale in a single country. It can also be applied to multiple countries where local scales can contain common as well as country-specific items. The IRT item parameters are sample invariant and, hence, can be used to score respondents in new samples on the same underlying scale. This allows comparison of new findings with previous findings, whether obtained in the same country or in other countries where the model has been applied before. This is another step toward generating a rigorous bank of marketing data and findings that is characteristic of science.
By extending existing hierarchical item response theory models and by combining it with optimal test design methods, we developed a procedure that yields country-specific short-form marketing scales, yet maintains cross-national comparability of latent scores. As such, our procedure is an important step to addressing the (in)famous emic-etic dilemma that has haunted international marketing research for decades (Burgess and Steenkamp 2006, Craig and Douglas 2001, Kumar 2000).

The procedure is flexible in the sense that the researcher can specify various constraints on item content, scale length, and measurement precision. Researchers can impose that the scale length is constant or impose a fixed minimum precision across countries. Although the latter constraint is more in line with current marketing practice especially in applied studies, scale length may be of even greater concern. Precision can vary for respondents high or low on the trait under investigation. Our procedure can also be used to adapt standardized scales to specific subcultures within a country, which hitherto received the same instrument. Countries like the United States have distinct subcultures, with unique attitudes, values, and behavioral expressions, calling for items that are specific for different subcultures (Benet-Martínez and John 1998).
Our model has several limitations that offer avenues for further research. It assumes that a single substantive construct underlies the items--possibly with ill-behaved items. A number of marketing scales (e.g., SERVQUAL, MARKOR) are truly multidimensional in that they consist of multiple, correlated substantive factors. If the dimensional structure is stable across countries (which can be assessed using standard CFA techniques), one solution would be to apply our method to each factor separately. This is a reasonable procedure when the correlations between the substantive factors are modest in magnitude (our work on scale development and analysis suggests that 0 3 is a reasonable cutoff). If the factors are more highly correlated, a simultaneous procedure is preferable. Statistical procedures should be developed to derive short forms for multidimensional scales while taking into account that a certain subscale precision is required.
An even more difficult situation arises when the dimensional structure is unstable countries, because items of a multidimensional scale load on different factors in different countries or because in some countries the unidimensional scale breaks into multiple (possibly different) substantive dimensions. Received insight holds that if a scale lacks stability of factor structure ("configural invariance"), cross-national comparisons are not possible (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998, Vandenberg and Lance 2000). Hence, short-form scales do not make sense either. Future model development might address this situation, possibly by focusing on higher other factors.
IRT assumes that the estimated parameters are not affected by their position in the questionnaire. This assumption is not uncontested (Baker 2001). Consequently, the educational literature has recently started to consider context effects (De Boeck and Wilson 2004), but to the best of our knowledge, there are no articles that show empirically that item parameters are heavily affected. More research is needed on

687

possible context effects and how to deal with them. We speculate that context effects are less strong if items pertaining to the same construct are grouped together (cf. Bradlow and Fitzsimons 2001). In that case, the local context will be constant across surveys.
To date, all IRT models--including our model-- specify a reflective relation between items and the latent construct. Recently, one can witness an increased interest in marketing in formative scales (Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer 2001, Jarvis et al. 2003). The concept of short-form scales is difficult to reconcile with the formative logic, which assumes a census of items. Future research should examine this issue in detail.
Our model identifies and controls for cross-national differences in item functioning, but does not provide insight into what causes differential item functioning across countries. A fruitful area of research is to combine our model outcomes with follow-up (qualitative) research to understand why items function differently across countries. Once we have identified the causes of differential item functioning, these factors might be quantified and added as covariates in an extended version of our model.
Finally, it would be interesting to reduce scale length even more via computer adaptive testing (CAT) (Wainer et al. 2000). Such procedures tailor the items to the exact trait levels of respondents. For instance, in health care, doctors are already administering adaptive scales to patients, and the development of CAT is likely to increase with the advent of more and powerful multimedia technology.

Appendix. Estimation Details

We use Bayesian inference for the IRT model, in which we

specify the posterior distribution of all model parameters.

We use data augmentation (Tanner and Wong 1987) to facil-

itate estimation. By defining a continuous latent variable Z

that underlies the ordinal responses contained in X, it is

easier to sample from the conditional distributions of the

parameters of interest. Parts of the MCMC algorithm can be

found in de Jong et al. (2007). The following steps need to

be added:

The prior is log agk  N log ak

and log agk

The full conditional distribution is the product of the

prior and the likelihood. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

must be used to obtain the samples because the posterior

distribution of the item parameters is not a standard

distribution.

For identification, it is imposed that
