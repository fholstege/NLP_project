Lowering Customer Evaluation Costs, Product Differentiation, and Price Competition

When match uncertainty is resolved via costly evaluation, the first product sampled by a customer is more likely to make the sale. This prompts firms to lower their products' evaluation costs to attract customers to sample their products first. Such efforts by firms are called customer learning investment (CLI). When product quality is freely observable but horizontal match is not, we examine how CLI choices interact with quality and price competition in a duopoly. CLI has a competition effect in that a higher CLI of a firm increases its demand but decreases that of its rivals. In the market-covered duopoly, both qualities will decrease (increase) when the high-end (low-end) firm invests more in customer learning, and remain unchanged when they invest equally, relative to when neither firm invests. We further show that the firm with a higher relative production efficiency invests more in customer learning than the competitor. In the market-not-covered duopoly, CLI by the lowend firm also creates a market-expansion effect by inducing some additional low-end customers to sample and purchase its product. This may induce it to invest more than the high-end firm, even when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency.

1. Introduction
In markets such as apparel, appliances, consumer electronics, cars, software, and industrial goods, customers often spend considerable time and effort to ascertain whether and how a product meets their idiosyncratic needs (Shread 2012).1 Because customers recognizing a good match with a product have reduced incentive to continue to evaluate other products, each firm attempts to lower the evaluation costs of its product, hoping to woo prospective buyers to evaluate its product first. Examples abound. Some retailers run free shuttle services through major residential locations. Software vendors develop demo versions and easy to follow user manuals. Producers of enterprise software and other industrial goods maintain sales teams to showcase their products and to address questions from interested buyers.
More important, firms' product quality decisions and efforts to lower customers' evaluation costs seem to affect each other. The four antidepressants with superior quality, i.e., Sertraline, Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Citalopram, use stronger sampling intensities than the other antidepressants (Gu and Xie 2013).
1 Another example is certain financial products. For example, brokers that sell complex financial securities prepare reports and host seminars to help potential buyers determine whether the securities suit their needs (Madan and Soubra 1991).

In apparel retailing, Saks Fifth Avenue offers higher quality products and sales support than Macy's, which in turn offers better products and services than Walmart. At Apple's experience centers and stores, well trained staff introduce various product features to prospective buyers and help with their technical issues (Wall Street Journal 2011). As Samsung improved its product quality in recent years, it also opened its own mini stores in more than 1,400 Best Buy stores (Wall Street Journal 2013). Although we lack direct evidence that firms' product quality decisions depend on their effort to lower customers' evaluation costs, Apple's story indicates that such a linkage is plausible. A widely held belief is that it is Apple's superior products that draw traffic into its physical stores. Its phenomenal investment in physical stores and associated staff training leads us to expect that it will continue to develop high quality products because if its product quality deteriorates and fewer people visit its stores, the investment would be wasted.
In a duopoly, we investigate the firms' effort to ease customer evaluation of product match, hereafter called CLI, and how it interacts with their quality choices and pricing. We address several questions. First, how do the firms' CLIs affect their pricing? Second, how do product qualities change relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning, and

how does the production technology drive their CLIs? Third, because the market may not be fully covered in relatively young industries, how does the equilibrium differ for covered and noncovered markets? How do the simultaneous and sequential choices of CLI and quality affect the market outcome differently? Last, when product development requires a fixed research and development (R&D) cost, how does CLI drive quality provision?
Our baseline model is outlined as follows. The two firms each offer a single product with a vertical and horizontal attribute. Customers have heterogeneous preference for quality. Whereas each product's quality and price are assumed to be costlessly observable, its horizontal match is idiosyncratic and can only be determined via costly evaluation.2 For simplicity, we assume the two products' match values are identically and independently distributed across customers. Each firm can lower customers' cost of evaluating its product by making proper investments. We consider a two-stage game wherein the firms first choose and commit to quality and CLI and then compete in price. Observing the decisions of both firms and her own preference for quality, each customer determines her optimal search and purchase strategy. The firms' demand then realizes.
Our main analysis focuses on a market-covered duopoly, where total industry demand is fixed. Here we reveal the competition effect of CLI: The demand of the firm making a larger CLI expands, at the expense of the competitor. Consequently, the price of the firm with a larger CLI increases whereas the other's decreases relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning. Symmetric investments do not affect the firms' demand and prices.
For fixed product qualities, we show that the firm with a production efficiency advantage makes a larger CLI because it enjoys a higher marginal return from CLI. If the products' unit cost difference is below their utility difference for the average customer, the highend firm has a higher relative production efficiency and invests more in customer learning. The low-end firm invests more otherwise.
When the firms endogenize both product quality and CLI, we obtain two results. First, if the highend (low-end) firm makes a greater CLI both product qualities will decrease (increase) relative to when neither firm invests. The reason is that the firms' relative CLIs affect their demand elasticities of quality. The demand elasticity of quality of the high-end

firm is negative and that of the low-end firm is positive.3 A greater CLI by the high-end firm increases its own demand elasticity and decreases the other's, prompting both firms to lower their qualities. The case wherein the low-end firm makes a greater CLI is analogous.
Second, the high-end firm invests more in customer learning if each firm's quality is below a respective threshold, and the low-end firm invests more otherwise. As in the case of fixed qualities, here the firms' (endogenous) relative production efficiencies drive their relative CLIs. The greater the ratio between the firms' unit cost difference and quality difference, the higher the low-end firm's relative production efficiency (and the lower the high-end firm's), as we assume unit production cost is a convex function of quality. When both qualities are low (high), the highend (low-end) firm has a higher relative production efficiency and makes a larger CLI.
The main analysis is extended in a few directions. First, we examine the market-not-covered duopoly, where the firms choose CLIs first, select product quality next, and set prices last. When the market is not covered, CLI by the low-end firm introduces a market-expansion effect (beside the competition effect): Some of the low-end customers would not participate in the absence of CLI, but will now sample (and purchase in case of a good match) the lowend product. This leads to some new results. When their CLIs are sufficiently close to each other, both firms' prices increase relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning. Which firm makes a larger CLI depends not only on its relative production efficiency but also on the cost of the CLI. In particular, when unit production cost remains constant over quality (so that the high-end firm has a production efficiency advantage), the low-end firm invests more if the cost of the CLI is sufficiently low, and the high-end firm invests more otherwise. Second, we analyze the three-stage CLI-quality-price game in a market-covered duopoly. When unit production cost remains constant over quality, the high-end firm's CLI (weakly) dominates that of the low-end firm, consistent with our baseline model. This contrasts with the market-not-covered case and highlights the role of the market-expansion effect of CLI. Third, we study the effect of CLI on R&D competition. Whereas the low-end quality remains intact (at the lowest permissible quality), CLI lowers the high-end quality relative to when neither firm invests.
The current paper is related to the literature on consumer search. Whereas the early literature on
3 In the stage-one game, the demand of the high-end firm increases as its quality decreases, and that of the low-end firm increases as its quality increases. Later we say that a firm's demand elasticity of quality increases if its absolute value increases.

search largely focuses on price search in markets of homogeneous goods, several models examine markets with exogenous product differentiation (Wolinsky 1986, Bakos 1997, Lal and Sarvary 1999, Anderson and Renault 1999). More recently, researchers have begun to examine the role of search in product design. In the horizontal duopoly of Kuksov (2004), consumers costlessly observe the product attributes but incur a search cost to discover price, and the firms are uncertain about consumers' valuation. He finds that lower search costs may lead to greater product differentiation and hence higher prices. Bar-Isaac et al. (2011) show that lower search costs induce firms to choose extremal (most broad or most niche) product designs. Mehta et al. (2003) and Liu and Dukes (2013) develop search theoretic models of consideration set formation. Bergen et al. (1996), Cachon et al. (2008), Kuksov and Villas-Boas (2010), and Villas-Boas (2009) focus on the role of search or evaluation cost in multiproduct firms' variety choices. Unlike our current paper, however, none of these papers examines the impacts of search on firms' product quality choices.
Our model also relates to those papers on vertical differentiation and product line design. Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Moorthy (1984) provide early monopoly models of vertical product line design, focusing on how to mitigate cannibalization within the line. Desai et al. (2001) examine the trade-offs of component commonality in product line design. In a duopoly, Shaked and Sutton (1982), Moorthy (1988), and Lehmann-Grube (1997) show that the firms choose differentiated qualities to relax price rivalry under various cost structures.4 In an oligopoly, Jing (2006) examines how the firms' relative cost efficiencies may drive their profitability. Desai (2001), Jing and Zhang (2011), and Villas-Boas and SchmidtMohr (1999) present competitive models of product line design and pricing. In these models, consumers have perfect information about the characteristics and prices of the products offered. In our model, quality and price are freely observable, but horizontal match is not. We analyze how firms' efforts to lower customers' costs of evaluating match interact with their quality and pricing decisions.
The role of CLI in our model is somewhat reminiscent of informative advertising (Anderson and Renault 2009, Grossman and Shapiro 1984, Iyer et al. 2005, Meurer and Stahl 1994, Soberman 2004). In models of informative advertising, those exposed to advertisements are assumed to costlessly learn the value of advertised attributes whereas the other consumers remain uninformed (Grossman and Shapiro
4 Shaked and Sutton (1982) and Moorthy (1988) assume zero and convex unit variable costs, and Lehmann-Grube (1997) assume a convex fixed cost of quality.

1984) or resort to search (Desai et al. 2010). Similarly, information provided by the firm is also assumed to inform consumers about their product valuation (Lewis and Sappington 1994, Guo and Zhao 2009, and Gu and Xie 2013). Therefore, advertising and information provision are treated as perfect substitutes for consumer search. However, whereas advertising may fully convey relatively simple product attributes, in the market scenarios noted above firms' advertising and efforts to provide information rarely eliminate search, although they effectively lower customers' evaluation costs. Whereas Rajiv et al. (2002), Anderson and Renault (2009), and Gu and Xie (2013) examine how the sellers' exogenous quality levels affect their advertising and information provision decisions, we also show how firms' customer learning efforts may impact their endogenous quality choices. In a setting with identical products and service free riding, Desai et al. (2010) examine retail competition in service and price advertising. However, such free riding may not arise when the firms offer distinct products (as in our model).
Guo and Zhao (2009) and Liu and Xiao (2013) study firms' decisions to disclose quality. Guo and Zhao (2009) show that competition may lead firms to reveal less information than a monopolist, whereas Liu and Xiao (2013) focus on how quality disclosure affects channel interactions. In the monopoly model of Guo and Zhang (2012) and the duopoly model of Kuksov and Lin (2010), consumers are ex ante uncertain about their preference for quality. Kuksov and Lin (2010) highlights the free riding in either firm's provision of preference-revealing information. In Guo and Zhang (2012), consumers incur a deliberation cost to discover their quality preference. They show that firm profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare can all increase with consumers' deliberation cost. Our information environment contrasts with these models: Quality is common knowledge and each customer knows her quality preference. Instead, match is unknown and discovered via costly evaluation.
Jing (2011) examines a monopolist's optimal investment in facilitating consumer learning of product valuation and dynamic pricing of a durable good, and finds that it underinvests for low and high unit costs but may overinvest for intermediate unit costs. Gu and Liu (2013) study how a strategic retailer may benefit from manipulating consumers' search cost through shelf layout. They show that the retailer benefits more from displaying products in distant locations (i.e., increasing search cost) as the difference between their fit probabilities increases. When consumers face search costs, Iyer and Kuksov (2012) analyze retail competition to attract shoppers by investing in the shopping experience. By contrast, we

focus on firms' incentives to lower customers' evaluation costs. Besides, product demonstrations (Heiman and Muller 1996) and return policies (Davis et al. 1995, Hess et al. 1996), as special forms of customer learning investments, both help mitigate customers' match uncertainty.
A model is developed in §2. Section 3 characterizes customers' optimal search behavior and the equilibrium in a market-covered duopoly. Section 4 explores a few extensions. Two benchmarks of the model are presented in §5. Section 6 summarizes this paper, discusses some of its limitations, and suggests avenues for future research. The appendix provides proofs of Propositions 2 through 6. The other proofs and deductions are given in the online appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ mksc.2015.0918).

2. Model

Consider a duopoly wherein each firm produces a sin-

gle product. Each product has two attributes, one ver-

tical and the other horizontal (as in Desai 2001). Let qi (i = 1 2) denote firm i's quality. The products differ in

quality. Without loss of generality, let product 1 have

a higher quality, i.e., q1 > q2 > 0.5 Customers differ in their valuation of quality and each demand at most

one unit of the product. Following Mussa and Rosen

(1978) and Moorthy (1988), we assume that a cus-

tomer of type derives utility qi from a product of quality qi. Here represents the customer's constant marginal willingness to pay for quality, and is uni-

formly distributed over

b

1 + b , where

The

customer obtains an additional utility v that reflects

the match between her idiosyncratic need and each

product's horizontal attribute. Therefore, customer

receives surplus qi + v - pi from buying product i at price pi. The two products' match values are identically and independently distributed across customers.

For simplicity, we assume that v = r with probabil-

ity (r > 0 and 0 < < 1), and that v = 0 other-

wise. A product is said to yield a good match when

v = r and a poor match when v = 0. We assume that

r is sufficiently low relative to customers' valuation

of quality, which ensures that the higher quality firm

charges a higher price in equilibrium (see §§3.2 and

4.1 below). The distributions of customer type and

match value are common knowledge, but each cus-

tomer's type is known only to that customer.

We assume that each product's quality and price

are costlessly observable, as in Anderson and Renault

(2009), Guo and Zhang (2012), and Gu and Xie (2013).

However, its match value is idiosyncratic and can only

be discovered via evaluation by each customer. In several markets, prices and certain quality attributes (e.g., speed and memory of computers, resolution of digital camera, safety of cars, etc.) are well publicized by the firms themselves or authoritative third parties (such as Consumer Reports, Edmunds.com, and cNet.com). However, potential customers frequently devote time and effort to gauging how the products' horizontal features (e.g., size of clothing and shoes, interface of digital devices, exterior and interior design of cars, whether a piece of furniture suits the intended space) meet their specific needs. In addition, brands may develop certain quality reputations over time. When such mature brands release new products, they are still inspected for potential match before purchase. In the absence of firm intervention, each customer incurs cost s to evaluate either product. Throughout, we assume that s  1 - r.
The evaluation cost includes time to visit a seller and to inspect its product. Following convention (Anderson and Renault 2006, Hauser and Wernerfelt 1990, Wolinsky 1986) we assume customers always incur the search or evaluation cost to purchase a product. This is plausible if returns are infeasible or costly. When buying a product requires visiting the seller, the customer may just evaluate its match before the transaction (e.g., as with clothes and shoes). For a technological product (e.g., digital device or software), evaluation is also the process of learning how to use it. Therefore, the customer would rather evaluate it before purchase.
The firms face the same technologies. Production has zero fixed costs. Following convention, we assume that the unit production cost, c q , is constant at any quality level and is an increasing, convex function of quality q. Each firm can also choose to lower customers' cost of evaluating its product. Specifically, by making an investment of ki, firm i (i = 1 2) lowers its product's evaluation cost to 1 - ki s.6 Firm i incurs a fixed cost h ki to invest ki regardless of how many potential customers actually evaluate its product. Zettelmeyer (2000) similarly assumes that
6 Alternatively, we may also model the impact of CLI ki as lowering product i's evaluation cost by an absolute amount (rather than by a percentage). This alternative assumption does not significantly alter the analysis and results. To see this, when ki lowers product i's evaluation cost to s - ki, its reservation price (see §3.1 for construction) Ri satisfies Ri = - s - ki + qi - pi + r + 1 - Ri, or equivalently, Ri = qi - pi + r - s - ki / . We can easily verify that the firms' demand functions (in Equations (8) and (9)) and the price equilibrium (in Equations (10) and (11)) continue to hold after setting s = 1. Proposition 1 thus remains intact. We can further verify that the firms' stage-1 profit functions (given by Equations (12) and (13)) and Proposition 2 hold after setting s = 1. Propositions 3 and 4 also remain intact. The equilibrium k1 and k2 in Equations (16) and (17) and Proposition 5 continue to hold after setting s = 1.

the firm incurs a fixed cost to set consumers' search cost of its product. We assume that h > 0 and h > 0 for 0  ki < 1 and that limki1- h ki = , so that it is infeasible to entirely eliminate a product's evaluation cost. Such fixed investment may include developing a demonstration version of the software, devising userfriendly manuals, maintaining a sales team to assist evaluation, and building experience centers. All else equal, a customer will first sample the product that is easier to evaluate, and may stop her search and purchase after realizing a good match. Therefore, beside quality and price, ease of evaluation is another key dimension for potential differentiation, especially for products with match uncertainty. We shall focus on the strategic impacts of CLI and its interplay with the firms' quality and price decisions.
Both firms and customers are risk neutral and maximize their own expected payoffs. Competition unfolds in two stages. In stage one, the firms simultaneously announce and commit to product qualities qi and CLI ki. In stage two, observing q1, q2, k1, and k2 the firms set prices pi simultaneously.7 Finally, observing both firms' qualities, CLIs, and prices, each customer decides on her optimal search strategy. Following convention, we assume that search is without replacement and with free recall. Here we also assume that the firms' CLIs, just like qualities and prices, are ex ante observable to customers. Indeed, the efficacy of many firms' experience centers (e.g., those of Apple) are well known. Some retailers are known for providing better in-store services than others. Prospective buyers can readily discern the extent of evaluation assistance through a seller's website, a telephone call, or word of mouth.
3. The Market-Covered Duopoly
Our main analysis focuses on the case wherein each customer purchases one of the goods. The market is covered when bq2 - p2  2s, which holds in equilibrium when b is sufficiently high (see below). The market-not-covered case is postponed to §4.
3.1. Customer Search Each customer's optimal search strategy in our model is given by Weitzman (1979). Weitzman (1979, p. 643) addresses the following general problem (which he calls "Pandora's problem"). A risk-neutral agent faces n closed boxes. Box i (1  i  n) contains a reward of xi, which follows an independent distribution Fi. It costs si to open box i to learn its reward.8 When
7 In §§4.1 and 4.2, we consider a three-stage game wherein the firms choose CLI ki first, quality qi next, and price pi last, in market-notcovered and market-covered duopolies, respectively.
8 Weitzman's formulation of Pandora's problem also accommodates time-lagged learning, where the reward of box i is known after a

search stops, the consumer collects the highest reward

uncovered. In this setting, what is the optimal search

and stopping rule?

In a majority of the extant search models, all boxes

are identical and thus search sequence does not mat-

ter. As is already well known, search stops once the

highest reward uncovered equals or exceeds a reser-

vation price. The reservation price has the defining

property that the agent is indifferent between accept-

ing a reward equal to the reservation price and con-

tinuing to search.

Remarkably, when the boxes are different (each with

its own reward distribution and search cost),

Weitzman (1979) shows that the optimal search pol-

icy still takes a reservation price form. Each box

i's reservation price Ri is uniquely defined by Ri =

-si + Ri

Ri 0

dFi

xi

+

Ri xi dFi xi . The left-hand side

(LHS) of this equation is a known reward Ri, and

its right-hand side (RHS) is the expected net surplus

(net of search cost) from sampling box i. That is,

when presented with a known reward Ri, the agent is indifferent between accepting it and continuing to open box i.9 Equivalently, Ri xi - Ri dFi xi = si. The optimal search sequence is in descending order of

reservation prices and search ends once the highest

uncovered reward equals or exceeds the reservation

price of every closed box (see Weitzman 1979, pp.

646­647).

In our current model, each customer's decision

problem is a special case of that in Weitzman (1979).

We consider two products (n = 2), each with three

attributes: quality, price, and match. Whereas quality

and price are costlessly observable, match is unknown

and costly to observe. Therefore, each product's total

value remains unknown and costly to observe. The

products have a common and independent binary

distribution of match value but potentially different

search costs 1 - ki s, which depend on the firms' investment in customer learning ki.10 Because our customers have heterogeneous (marginal) valuation for

quality ( ), they may differ in their optimal search

policies. Letting Ri denote product i's reservation price for customer , we have Ri = - 1 - ki s + qi - pi + r + 1 - Ri, or equivalently

Ri = qi - pi + r - 1 - ki s

(1)

time lag of ti and where Pandora maximizes (expected) discounted present value. As noted by Weitzman, instantaneous learning (as we consider) is the special case ti = 0.
9 An alternative interpretation provided by Weitzman (1979, p. 646) is the following: Suppose, hypothetically, there are an infinite number of only type-i boxes. Then Ri represents the expected surplus (net of search cost) of following the optimal search strategy.
10 Each product i's total value for customer thus also follows a binary distribution: It equals qi - pi + r with probability and equals qi - pi with probability 1 - . Weitzman (1979, p. 648) provides a similar example with a binary value distribution.

Otherwise, she will first sample product 2. By con-
struction, 3 < 2 < 1. First, consider the customers in 2 1 + b . For customer > 1, product 1's true value is at least q1 - p1 (in case of poor match), which exceeds product 2's reservation price, q2 - p2 + a2. By Weitzman's stopping rule, she will end her search and
purchase product 1. If customer  2 1 realizes a good match with product 1, she will stop search and
purchase it, since its true value exceeds product 2's
reservation price ( q1 + r - p1 > q1 + a1 - p1  q2 + a2 - p2 for  2 1 ). Otherwise, she will continue to sample product 2 as the latter's reservation price
exceeds product 1's realized value ( q2 + a2 - p2  q1 - p1 for < 1). If product 2 yields a good match,
she will purchase it. If product 2 is also a poor match,
she will buy product 1 if q1 - p1  q2 - p2 or equivalently if  p1 - p2 / q1 - q2 and will purchase product 2 otherwise.
Next, consider the customers in b 2 . For customer < 3, product 2's true value is at least q2 - p2 (in the case of poor match), which exceeds product 1's

11 The binary value distribution renders a relatively simple charac-
terization of reservation price (Ri) and each firm's demand. A more general distribution may complicate the analysis. For example, sup-
pose v = r1 with probability 1, v = r2 with probability 2 and v = 0 with probability 1 - 1 - 2, where r1 > r2 > 0. Then, whether Ri is above or below qi - pi + r2 depends on the value of 1 (Ri 
qi - pi + r2  1  1 - ki s/ r1 - r2 ). However, in the case where Ri  qi - pi + r2, the subsequent analysis remains intact as with a binary distribution.

search and purchase it, since its realized value exceeds
product 1's reservation price ( q2 + r - p2 > q2 + a2 - p2  q1 + a1 - p1 for < 2). Otherwise, she will proceed to sample product 1 since product 1's reservation
price exceeds product 2's realized value ( q1 + a1 - p1 > q2 - p2 for > 3). If product 1 yields a good match, she will purchase it. If product 1 is also a bad

In the expression of D1, 1 + b - 1 is the customers in 1 1 + b who purchase product 1 after sampling it. The second term, 1 - 2 , is the customers in 2 1 who realize a good match with product 1 and hence purchase it. The third term, 1 - 2 1 - p1 - p2 / q1 - q2 , is the customers in p1 - p2 / q1 - q2 1 who purchase product 1 after realizing a poor match
with both products. The fourth term ( 1 - 2 - 3 ) is the customers in ( 3 2 who realize a poor match with product 2, proceed to sample product 1 and real-
ize a good match. They then purchase product 1. The
terms of D2 have analogous interpretations. Substituting for i (from (3)­(5)) and noting that a1 - a2 = s k1 - k2 , we rewrite the demand func-
tions as

The effect of CLI on demand reallocation is then immediate: By investing more than the competitor, firm i increases its own demand (at the expense of firm j) by s ki - kj / q1 - q2 , relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning, for i, j = 1 2, i = j. The reason is as follows: Customers in 2 1 + b (in the number of 1 + b - p1 - p2 - a1 - a2 / q1 - q2 ) will first sample product 1, and customers in b 2 (in the number of p1 - p2 - a1 - a2 / q1 - q2 - b) will first sample product 2. When product i is easier to evaluate than j (ai > aj ), more customers will first sample i, increasing the demand for i. Because the market is covered, the demand for j decreases. We call such demand reallocation the competition effect of CLI. Equal investments imply equal ease of evaluation and thus do not affect the firms' demand.
Each firm i chooses price pi to maximize its revenue Ri = Di pi - ci , where ci  c qi without confusion. The second-order conditions are clearly satisfied, and the first-order conditions lead to a unique price equilibrium

Note that p1 > p2 when r is sufficiently low (which implies s is low as s  1 - r by assumption). We can

attribute is not too important, some of the customers

will indeed purchase their preferred quality regard-

less of realized match. The market is covered if bq2 - p2  2s or equivalently if b  q1 - q2 - s k1 - k2 + c1 + 2c2 + 6s / q1 + 2q2 . It is easy to verify that firm i's equilibrium demand is Di = pi - ci / q1 - q2 and its revenue Ri = pi - ci 2/ q1 - q2 . To better demonstrate the impacts of CLI, we will frequently compare

with the equilibrium where neither firm invests in

customer learning (obtained by setting k1 = k2 = 0). Proposition 1 follows.

Proposition 1 (Effects of CLI on Pricing). Suppose the firms' qualities qi and CLIs ki are exogenously given. When they choose different CLIs, the equilibrium demand and price (and hence revenue) of the firm with a larger CLI are higher and those of the competitor are lower than when neither firm invests in customer learning. When they choose equal CLIs, each firm's demand and price remain the same as when neither firm invests in customer learning.

When the firms make equal investments, their products are equally costly to evaluate (just as when neither firm invests in customer learning), and thus their demand and prices remain intact. However, asymmetric CLIs always increase the demand and price of the firm making a larger CLI but decrease those of the other, relative to when neither firm invests. Consequently, the differences between the firms' market shares and prices enlarge when the high-end firm invests more, and shrink when the lowend firm invests more. Therefore, through making a greater CLI than the competitor the high-end firm reinforces its competitive advantage and the low-end firm alleviates its competitive disadvantage.

3.3. Competition in Quality and CLI in Stage One To show the strategic interplay between product quality and CLI, we now turn to the stage-one game

13 Because 0  ki < 1 by assumption, we have -1 < k1 - k2 < 1. We then have

Here the first inequality is due to ai < r by construction, the second due to k1 - k2 > -1, and the third due to s < 1 - r by assumption. It is easy to verify that 3 = p1 - p2 - a1 / q1 - q2 > b when r < 1 - b q1 - q2 + c1 - c2 / 3 + 2 1 - .
Similarly, we can show that 1 = p1 - p2 + a2 / q1 - q2 < 1 + b when r < 2 + b q1 - q2 - c1 - c2 / 3 + 2 1 - .

where the firms simultaneously choose and commit to qi and ki to maximize their profits, anticipating the subsequent price equilibrium. Their stage-1 objective functions are
1 1 = 9 q1 - q2 2 + b q1 - q2 - c1 - c2
+ s k1 - k2 2 - h k1 (12)

and 1
2 = 9 q1 - q2 1 - b q1 - q2 + c1 - c2 - s k1 - k2 2 - h k2 (13)

Any subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) must be jointly characterized by the firms' first order conditions (FOCs) w.r.t. ki and qi (given in the proof of Proposition 2 in the appendix). Proposition 2 identifies its basic properties.

Proposition 2. In equilibrium: (A) The firms' CLIs

satisfy h k1 + h k2 = 2s/3 and their qualities satisfy

;

(B)

As

technologies

evolve,

firm

1,

the

high-end firm, will adjust its quality and CLI in opposite

directions. Firm 2 will adjust its quality and CLI in the

same direction.

That h k1 + h k2 = 2s/3 implies that the firms' total investments cannot be too high. When h is fixed,

changes in production technology (c) will cause the

firms' CLIs to move in opposite directions. When

h k = k2, we have k1 + k2 = s/ 3 . That c q1 -

c

q2

=

3 2

reflects the degree of quality differentia-

tion. When c is fixed, changes in customer learning

technology (h) will cause the firms' qualities to move

in the same direction. When c q = q2, we have

q1 - q2 = 3/ 4 . The intuition for part (B) of Proposition 2 is that each firm wishes to expand its

demand through lowering its product's evaluation

cost. When the market is covered, the only way for

the high-end (low-end) firm to increase its demand

is to acquire additional customers with progressively

lower (higher) valuation for quality.

Let qiN denote firm i's equilibrium quality when neither firm invests in customer learning.14 The next two

propositions provide our core results.

Proposition 3 (Effects of CLI on Quality Choices). Compared with when neither firm invests in customer learning: (A) If the equilibrium involves a positive correlation between CLI and quality, both firms' qualities decrease; (B) If the equilibrium involves a negative correlation between CLI and quality, both firms' qualities increase; and (C) Otherwise, both qualities remain unchanged.

14 Note that q1N and q2N are jointly given by the firms' FOCs w.r.t. qi (see the proof of Proposition 2 in the appendix) after setting k1 = k2 = 0.

This proposition shows the possible impacts of CLI competition on the firms' quality choices. When the high-end (low-end) firm invests more in customer learning, both qualities will decrease (increase) relative to when neither firm invests. The firms' qualities remain intact with symmetric investments. Proposition 3 is rather strong as it does not depend on the production (c) or customer learning (h) technologies.
The rationale behind this is that the firms' relative investments in customer learning drive their demand elasticities of quality. Substituting p1 and p2 into (8) and (9) yields the firms' stage-one demand functions, which lead to15

Note that c q1 > c q1 - c q2 / q1 - q2 > c q2 , since c is increasing and convex by assumption. When

neither firm invests in CLI (k1 = k2 = 0), we have D1/ q1 < 0 and D2/ q2 > 0. This implies that to expand its demand firm 1 (2) needs to lower (raise)

its quality. When k1 > k2, D1 becomes more elastic in q1 and D2 is less elastic in q2 than when neither firm invests. This causes both firms to lower their qualities.

When k1 < k2, D1 is less elastic in q1 and D2 is more elastic in q2 than when neither firm invests. Therefore, both firms will raise their product qualities.

Proposition 4 (Effects of Quality on CLI

product qualities are high (in that q1 > q^1 and q2 > q^2), the low-end firm, firm 2, invests more in customer learning;
and (C) Otherwise (in that q1 = q^1 and q2 = q^2), the firms invest equally in customer learning.

The essence of Proposition 4 is that the firm with a

greater relative production efficiency invests more in cus-

tomer learning. Intuitively, which firm invests more in

customer learning comes down to their relative pro-

duction efficiency. Note that c is convex by assump-

tion and that c

(from Proposition 2).

When the products' qualities are low (q1 < q^1 and

q2 < q^2), their cost difference is small relative to their

quality difference, so that c q1 - c q2 / q1 - q2 <

c q^1 - c q^2 / q^1 - q^2 (Figure 3(a)). In this case, the

high-end firm has a higher relative production effi-

ciency, as its quality advantage dominates its unit cost

disadvantage. This enables the high-end firm to cap-

ture a higher marginal return from CLI, and it thus

invests more aggressively in customer learning than

the low-end firm. When the products' qualities are

high (q1 > q^1 and q2 > q^2), their cost difference is large relative to their quality difference, so that c q1 - c q2 / q1 - q2 > c q^1 - c q^2 / q^1 - q^2 (Figure 3(b)). In this case, the low-end firm has a higher relative

production efficiency and reaps a higher marginal

return from CLI. It then invests more in customer

learning than the high-end firm.

To further clarify the above analysis, we provide

two examples.

Example 1. Suppose h k = k2 and c q = q2,
with > s/6 and > 0. The unique SPE then fol-
lows from the firms' FOCs: k1 = k2 = s/ 6 , q1 = 5 + 4b / 8 and q2 = -1 + 4b / 8 . When neither firm invests in customer learning, the unique quality equilibrium is q1N = q1 and q2N = q2. Propositions 3 and 4 clearly hold in this example.

Example 2. Suppose h k = k3 and c q = q2, with > 9/ 16s and 32 s2/81 < < 2s 16 s 2/ 27 2. When neither firm invests in customer learning, q1N = 5 + 4b / 8 and q2N = -1 + 4b / 8 . Let A  32 s2/ 81 and B  2s/ 9 . From the firms' FOCs, we obtain two SPEs: (1) k1 = A + 2B - A2 /2, k2 = A - 2B - A2 /2, q1 = 1/ 4 5 + 4b /2 - 3A/ 2B 2B - A2 < q1N , q2 = 1/ 4 -1 + 4b /2 - 3A/ 2B 2B - A2 < q2N ; (2) k1 = A - 2B - A2 /2, k2 = A + 2B - A2 /2, q1 = 1/ 4 5 + 4b /2 + 3A/ 2B 2B - A2 > q1N , q2 = 1/ 4 -1 + 4b /2 + 3A/ 2B 2B - A2 > q2N . When 32 s2/81 < < 2s 16 s 2/ 27 2, we have 0 < ki < 1 (i = 1 2). It is easy to see that Propositions 3 and 4 hold in each of the
two SPEs.

3.4. Two Special Cases
3.4.1. CLI Competition with Exogenous Product Qualities. To better show how the firms' quality-cost positions drive their CLIs, we now examine a stageone game wherein the firms only endogenize CLIs, with product qualities exogenously fixed: q1 > q2.

In practice, many complex products are sold through intermediaries (e.g., dealers and retailers) who allocate resources to ease product evaluation but lack direct control over product quality.
Observing each other's quality levels, the firms simultaneously choose and commit to CLI ki, anticipating the stage-2 price equilibrium above. For tractability, here we assume h k = k2, with > 0. The firms' stage-one profit functions are given in (12) and (13). The unique SPE then follows from the FOCs w.r.t. ki:

1 k1 = 2

(17)

In equilibrium, the market is covered if bq2 - p2  0. When > 2s2/ 9 q1 - q2 , (k1 - k2) increases in b and hence p2 (see (11)) decreases in b. Therefore, bq2 - p2  0 holds when b is not too small. We can easily verify that 1 < 1 + b holds when is sufficiently
large and when r is not too high, and that 3 > b holds
when b and r are not too high.

Proposition 5. Suppose the firms' qualities q1 and q2 are exogenously fixed, q1 > q2 and h k = k2, where > 2s2/ 9 q1 - q2 . (A) When c1 - c2 / q1 - q2  1 + 2b /2, firm 1 invests more than firm 2 in customer learning.

Jing: Customer Evaluation Costs, Product Differentiation, Price Competition

122

Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 113­127, © 2016 INFORMS

Firm 2's profits are lower than those when neither firm invests. (B) When c1 - c2 / q1 - q2 > 1 + 2b /2, firm 2 invests more than firm 1 in customer learning. Firm 1's
profits are lower than those when neither firm invests.

Note that 1 + 2b /2 = 1 + b + b /2 is the mean (marginal) valuation for quality in this market. When the products' unit cost difference is lower than their utility difference for the average customer (c1 - c2 
1 + 2b q1 - q2 /2), firm 1, the high-end firm, invests more in customer learning than firm 2. Firm 2 invests more otherwise. Proposition 5 is thus consistent with Proposition 4 in spirit: The more efficient firm invests more in customer learning. In either case, the firm investing less is strictly worse off than when neither firm invests, reflecting the competition effect of CLI. Proposition 5 is also consistent with the finding of Gu and Xie (2013) that when marginal production cost is constant over quality, the high-end firm has a stronger incentive to provide matching information than the low-end firm.
The intuition behind part (A) of Proposition 5 is as follows: When c1 - c2 / q1 - q2  1 + 2b /2, if the firms were to invest equally in customer learning, firm 1 would enjoy a higher marginal return from CLI than firm 2.17 This would induce firms 1 and 2 to increase and decrease their CLIs, respectively. The intuition for part (B) is analogous. Part (A) of Proposition 5 resonates with the following observation: In industries where unit production costs do not increase significantly with quality (e.g., software, pharmaceuticals, and consumer electronics), firms with higher qualities often invest markedly more in customer learning (in the form of demonstration, detailing, and setting up experience centers, etc.) than their low-end counterparts.
3.4.2. Quality Competition with Exogenous CLIs. In industries where new products are released at a rapid pace (such as consumer electronics and digital devices), firms' investments in experience centers and sales efforts are often fixed well before the next generation products are developed. To gauge how the firms' exogenous CLIs affect quality competition in such scenarios, we now analyze a stage-one game wherein they compete only in quality. Specifically, we assume c q = q2, where > 0. The firms' stage-one objective functions are given by (12) and (13), with c qi = qi2 and h ki = 0. We easily derive a unique equilibrium

q1

17 If k1 = k2, firm 1's marginal return from CLI is 2s/ 9 q1 - q2 · 2 + b q1 - q2 - c1 - c2 , and that of firm 2 is 2s/9 q1 - q2 1 - b · q1 - q2 + c1 - c2 . When c1 - c2 / q1 - q2  1 + 2b /2, the former
dominates the latter.

The market is covered if bq2 - p2  0, which holds when b is sufficiently large. We can easily verify
that 3 > b and 1 < 1 + b hold when 3a1 - 9/ 8 < s k1 - k2 < -3a2 + 9/ 8 . When neither firm invests in customer learning, the unique SPE is q1N = 5 + 4b / 8 and q2N = -1 + 4b / 8 . Proposition 3 clearly holds.

4. Extensions

4.1. Sequential Choice of CLI and Quality in the Market-Not-Covered Duopoly
Our baseline model considers a market-covered duopoly where the firms simultaneously choose product quality and CLI before competing in price. However, in industries with relatively short product life cycles (e.g., digital devices), firms sometimes invest in customer learning (e.g., setting up experience centers) before deciding on the quality of future generation products.18 Therefore, to account for such scenarios we now examine a three-stage game wherein the firms choose CLI (ki) in stage 1, quality (qi) in stage 2, and price (pi) in stage 3. In each stage, the firms observe each other's decisions in prior stages (if any) and act simultaneously. We analyze the market-notcovered case below and the market-covered case in §4.2. For tractability, in both cases we assume that c q = 0 for q  qL qH , where 0 < qL < qH , and h k = k for k  0 k¯ , where > 0 and 0 < k¯ < 1.19 Again, suppose firm 1 chooses an equal or higher quality.
When b is sufficiently close to zero, the customers with very low preference for quality do not purchase either good. We continue to focus on the scenario wherein some of the customers purchase their favorite products regardless of realized match. Clearly, the optimal decision rules of the customers in 3 1 + b remain identical to that in §3.1. To characterize optimal search by the remaining customers, we let

p2 4 = q2

and

p2 - a2 5 = q2

(20)

For the customers in 4 3 , the realized value of product 2 (even with a poor match) always exceeds

18 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this observation.
19 Clearly, analysis of the three-stage game is not tractable with general production and customer-learning technologies because formulating the firms' stage-1 objectives requires explicit values of equilibrium product qualities in stage 2. With a general production technology, the stage-2 quality equilibrium can best be characterized with the firms' FOCs.

the reservation price of product 1, i.e., q2 - p2  0 (  4) and q2 - p2 > q1 + a1 - p1 ( < 3). Therefore, these customers will purchase product 2 regard-
less of realized match. The customers in 5 4 will sample product 2 and will purchase it only if it is a
good match ( q2 + r - p2 + 1 - 0 - 1 - k2 s  0  q2 + a2 - p2  0). Note that when 3 > 4, a customer

where the second equality is obtained after collecting
terms and using ai = r - 1 - ki s/ . The competition effect of CLI persists; either firm
may increase its demand by investing more than
its competitor in customer learning. Besides, CLI
by firm 2 (the low-end firm) also creates a market-
expansion effect through inducing more low-end cus-
tomers to sample (and purchase in case of a good
match) its product. This is clear since 5 decreases in k2.
In the third stage, the firms observe each other's
CLI ki and quality qi and set prices pi simultaneously to maximize their own revenue, Ri = Dipi. The unique price equilibrium readily follows from the FOCs:

1 p1 = 4q1 - q2
· 2 1 + b q1 q1 - q2 + 2q1 - q2 a1 - q1 a2 (22)

and 1
p2 = 4q1 - q2 · 1 + b q2 q1 - q2 - q2 a1 + 2q1 - q2 a2 (23)

When r is sufficiently low, ai is low (regardless of the firms' CLIs) and p1 > p2 always holds.

20 When 3 > 4, 4 will not sample product 1, as 4q1 + r - p1 + 1 - 0 - 1 - k1 s < 0  p1q2 - p2q1 > q2a1, which holds when 3 > 4.

Proposition 6. Suppose q1 > q2. Firm 1's price is higher (lower) than when neither firm invests in customer
learning if k1/k2  < q1/ 2q1 - q2 . Firm 2's price is higher (lower) than when neither firm invests in customer
learning if k1/k2  > 2q1 - q2 /q2.

Proposition 6 contrasts with Proposition 1. In the

market-covered duopoly, compared with when nei-

ther firm invests in customer learning, the prices

remain unchanged under symmetric CLIs and move

in opposite directions otherwise. When the mar-

ket is not covered, both prices increase when the

difference between their CLIs is relatively small

(q1/ 2q1 - q2 < k1/k2 < 2q1 - q2 /q2). In particular, with symmetric CLIs both prices will increase. The intuition

is that symmetric CLIs do not directly affect the

high-end firm's demand, but increases the low-end

firm's demand due to the market-expansion effect,

thus relaxing price rivalry. The equilibrium revenues

are R1 = p1 2/ q1 - q2 and R2 = q1 p2 2/ q2 q1 - q2 . We now turn to the stage-2 quality competition. For

the

remainder

of

this

subsection,

we

assume

qL



4 7

qH

,

so that the feasible range of quality is not too broad.

When s is not too high, the unique quality equilibrium

involves maximum differentiation, i.e., q1 = qH and q2 = qL, regardless of the firms' stage-1 CLI decisions (see the

online appendix for deduction). The intuition behind

this is as follows: Because the unit cost is constant

(normalized to zero) over quality, firm 1, the high-

end firm, naturally chooses the highest feasible qual-

ity. However, the low-end firm faces a trade-off in its

quality choice. Choosing a lower quality helps mit-

igate the ensuing price rivalry, whereas choosing a

higher quality increases its product's market appeal

and hence demand. When the quality space is suffi-

ciently

narrow

(qL



4 7

qH

),

the

former

motive

domi-

nates the latter, leading to maximum differentiation.

In stage 1, the firms choose CLI ki. Firm i's period-1 objective function is i = Ri q1 = qH q2 = qL - ki.

7.

Suppose

qL

is

low. In the unique SPE, q1 = qH and q2 = qL. (A) When

the marginal cost of CLI ( ) is very low, both firms choose

the maximum CLI, k¯ . (B) When is intermediate and the

expected match value is relatively high, firm 2, the low-

end firm, invests k¯ and firm 1 does not invest in customer

learning. (C) When is intermediate and the expected

match value is relatively low, firm 1, the high-end firm,

invests k¯ and firm 2 does not invest in customer learning.

(D) When is sufficiently high, neither firm invests in

customer learning.21

Because each firm i's profit function is convex in ki, ki can only possibly take the extreme values

21 A restatement of Propositions 7 and 8 in the online appendix provides the exact conditions.

of 0 and k¯ . Not surprisingly, both firms invest the maximum amount k¯ when the marginal cost of CLI ( ) is sufficiently low (part (A)), and neither firm invests when is very high (part (D)). Asymmetric CLIs emerge for intermediate values of . When the expected match value is relatively high, the lowquality firm invests k¯ but the high-quality firm does not invest (part (B)). When the expected match value is relatively low, the opposite CLI pattern occurs (part (C)).
The intuition behind parts (B) and (C) is as follows: An important horizontal attribute (as in part (B)) strengthens the market-expansion effect of CLI, which prompts the low-end firm to invest more aggressively. The outcome is as if the firms differentiate by specializing in different attributes: One firm does not invest in customer learning but chooses a high quality, whereas the other chooses the maximum CLI but a low quality. On the other hand, a relatively unimportant horizontal attribute (part (C)) weakens the market-expansion effect of CLI, which curtails the low-end firm's incentive to invest. In this case, the high-end firm strengthens its competitive advantage by investing more in customer learning.
4.2. Sequential Choice of CLI and Quality in the Market-Covered Duopoly
To highlight the market-expansion effect of CLI in the market-not-covered duopoly, we examine the threestage CLI-quality-price game in the market-covered duopoly.
Proposition 8. There is a unique SPE in the marketcovered duopoly, where q1 = qH and q2 = qL. (A) When the marginal cost of quality ( ) is low, both firms choose the maximum CLI, k¯ . (B) When is intermediate, firm 1, the high-end firm, invests k¯ and firm 2 does not invest. (C) When is sufficiently high, neither firm invests in customer learning. (D) The low-quality firm ( firm 2) never invests more than the high-quality firm in customer learning.
Just as in the market-not-covered duopoly, both firms invest the maximum amount k when is very low (part (A)) and will not invest at all when is very high (part (C)). When takes intermediate values (as in part (B)), the high-quality firm invests k¯ whereas the low-quality firm does not invest at all in customer learning.
The high-end firm always invests equal or greater amounts in customer learning than the low-quality firm (part (D)), which contrasts with Proposition 7. In the market-not-covered duopoly, the market-expansion effect may prompt the low-quality firm to choose a strictly higher CLI than its rival to mitigate its competitive disadvantage. When the market is fully covered, the market-expansion effect of CLI

vanishes and the insight from Proposition 4 applies: The firm with a higher relative production efficiency (here, the high-quality firm) invests more in customer learning than its competitor.
4.3. The Effects of CLI on R&D In the basic model, the firms face zero fixed production costs and constant unit variable costs that increase in quality. For software and certain high tech goods, however, product quality is primarily driven by a firm's R&D expenditure; unit variable costs need not increase with quality. We now consider this alternative cost structure and examine how the firms' CLIs affect their product qualities or R&D efforts. Suppose that the feasible quality space is q , where q > 0 is some minimum quality standard possibly imposed by regulation. The firms face an identical R&D technology under which the costs of devising a product of quality q is g q , with g > 0 and g > 0. We assume that g 0 = 0, g 0 = 0, and limq g q = , as in Lehmann-Grube (1997). Their common unit variable costs are constant and independent of quality, and are normalized to zero. We retain the rest of the set-up of the basic model and focus on the market-covered duopoly.
The subgame perfect equilibrium is derived in the online appendix, where we show that the low-end quality equals q, the lowest admissible quality, regardless of whether the firms invest in customer learning. The high-end quality is strictly lower than when neither firm invests in customer learning. This is because at the price equilibrium the low-end firm's marginal revenue in own quality is always negative (with or without CLI) and because the firms' CLIs lower the high-end firms' marginal revenue in own quality.
5. Two Benchmarks
5.1. The Full-Information Duopoly We now consider a special case of the baseline model wherein each customer costlessly observes her match values with both products. The game under full information is essentially a special case of the baseline model with s = 0.22 The stage-2 price equilibrium is obtained with s = 0 in (10) and (11). The firms' stage-1 profit functions are given by (12) and (13) with s = 0. The quality equilibrium is then characterized by the FOCs: 2c q1F = 2 + b + c q1F - c q2F / q1F - q2F and 2c q2F = - 1 - b + c q1F - c q2F / q1F - q2F . The equilibrium under full information is thus identical to that of our baseline model when neither firm invests in customer learning, q1N and q2N .
22 There are 2 ( 1 - 2) customers with a good (poor) match with both products, 1 - customers with a good match with only product 1, and 1 - customers with a good match with only product 2.

5.2. A Duopoly Without Quality Differentiation Our main analysis has examined how CLI competition interacts with vertical differentiation. One may wonder about the strategic role of CLI in a setting with homogeneous quality. We now investigate a variant of the main model where the firms have an identical product quality, q0 say. Because q0 does not affect customer search, to ease exposition we normalize q0 and the unit cost to zero.
Customers will sample product i only if r - pi + 1 - 0 - 1 - ki s  0. Therefore, Ri = ai - pi  0 (i = 1 2) in equilibrium. Suppose product i has a higher reservation price than j, i.e., ai - pi > aj - pj  0 (i j = 1 2, i = j). Then, all customers will first sample i, and will purchase i if it yields a good match (with probability ). A customer who realizes a poor match (with probability 1 - ) will proceed to sample j, and will purchase j if it yields a good match. Firm i's demand is thus and firm j's 1 - . This demand discontinuity implies that there is no purestrategy equilibrium in the stage-2 pricing game.
Proposition 9. Suppose the firms' CLIs satisfy 0  k1  k2 < 1. The unique price equilibrium is in mixed strategies, and the firms' price distributions are

F1 p1

1 =

1

-

p1

a2 -

- a1

a1 - a2

and

F2 p2

1 =

1

-

p2

1 +

- a1

a1 - a2

for 1 - a1  p1  a1 and a2 - a1 < p2 < a2. Firm 1's strategy has an atom at a1. The equilibrium revenues are R1 = 1 - a1 and R2 = a2 - a1 .

The price equilibrium when k1 > k2 is obtained by invoking symmetry. By construction, the firm invest-
ing more in customer learning has a higher ai. Proposition 9 shows that the firm with a greater CLI (here,
firm 2) has more market power and collects higher
revenue. Firm 2 prices more aggressively in that it
prices below a2 with probability one, whereas firm 1 places an atom at a1.
We now turn to the stage-1 competition in CLI.
Without loss of generality, suppose firm 2 chooses an
equal or higher CLI than firm 1. By Proposition 9,
firm 1's stage-1 profit function is 1 k1 = 1 - r - s + sk1 - h k1 and firm 2's 2 k2 = r - s - 2a1 + sk2 - h k2 .

Proposition 10. (A) The unique SPE in CLI (after
suppressing the firms' identities) is one firm choosing kL and the other kH , where 1 - s = h kL and s = h kH . (B) Both firms make higher profits than when neither firm
invests in customer learning, and the firm choosing kH gains more from CLI.

Interestingly, the ex ante symmetric firms always choose different levels of CLI. The reason is that choosing different CLIs helps relax price rivalry. Without quality differentiation, the products are ex ante homogeneous. If the firms choose the same CLI, their products would have an identical ai and, consequently, all customers would first sample the product with a lower price. This intensifies price rivalry as the firms have to compete on the basis of price alone.
The equilibrium CLIs are efficient provided there are no economies of scope in lowering the products' evaluation costs. To see this, a social planner offers both products at cost (normalized to zero) and minimizes the sum of customers' expected search costs and the CLI costs. The customers will first sample the product with a lower evaluation cost. In case of a poor match (with probability 1 - ), she proceeds to sample the other product. Suppose product 2 has a (weakly) lower evaluation cost. Without any spillover effects in lowering the products' evaluation costs, the social planner chooses k2 and k1 to minimize 1 - k2 s + h k2 + 1 - 1 - k1 s + h k1 . Clearly, the efficient CLIs are kH and kL.
Somewhat surprisingly, CLI competition does not lead to a prisoner's dilemma, but instead increases both firms' profits. This is because prices are set before customers search in our model. When neither firm invests in customer learning, evaluation cost is high (at s) and firms must price sufficiently low (at or below a0 = r - s/ ) to induce search. Through lowering evaluation costs, CLI allows the firms to raise prices while attracting customers to search, which leads to higher profits.
6. Conclusion
When resolution of match uncertainty requires costly evaluation, the first product sampled by the customer is more likely to make the sale. All else equal, customers will first sample the product with a lower evaluation cost. Therefore, firms invest strategically to ease product evaluation. In a duopoly, we have shown that such CLI has a significant impact on quality and price competition.
In a market-covered duopoly, CLI demonstrates a competition effect: By investing more than the competitor in customer learning, a firm increases its demand at the expense of the competitor. For given product qualities, the price of the firm with a greater CLI increases whereas the competitor's decreases relative to when neither firm invests. When the firms endogenize product quality and CLI, both qualities will decrease when the high-end firm invests more, increase when the low-end firm invests more, and remain unchanged when they invest equally, relative to when neither firm invests. The high-end firm

Jing: Customer Evaluation Costs, Product Differentiation, Price Competition

invests more in customer learning than the low-end firm when the former has a higher relative production efficiency, and the low-end firm invests more otherwise. In a market-not-covered duopoly, CLI by the low-end firm further introduces a market-expansion effect; some of the low-end customers who would not sample either product without CLI will now sample the low-end product. Interestingly, the marketexpansion effect may induce the low-end firm to invest more in customer learning than the high-end firm even when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency, especially when horizontal match is relatively important.
Our model has its limitations. First, the binary distribution of match value simplifies analysis, as each product's reservation price is a linear function of CLI. A more general distribution exacerbates complexity but may not add significant new insights. Second, we have considered a duopoly. Although the optimal search rule developed by Weitzman (1979) applies to any finite number of options, the demand derivation becomes much more complex if there are more than two competing products. Third, because welfare analysis in a vertical setting is generally not tractable, we are unable to identify the effects of CLI on consumer surplus or social welfare. In the special case of symmetric investments, equilibrium qualities and prices remain the same as when neither firm invests, even though more customers will search. Consumer surplus thus increases. Last, aside from product quality, CLI may also affect the other marketing-mix variables. A direction for future research is to examine the impacts of CLI on horizontal differentiation. One possible set-up is that each product consists of two horizontal attributes, one observable and the other not. The observable attribute and the customers exist along a Hotelling line. When customers incur an evaluation cost to discover their valuation of the other attribute (i.e., match), one may investigate how the firms' CLIs affect locations of the observable attribute.
