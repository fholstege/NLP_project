<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A key conundrum facing organizations is how to adjust marketing budgets in response to the business cycle. While most firms use procyclical spending (spending less during economic contractions), academic studies often recommend countercyclical spending (spending more during contractions), which begs the following question: What is the right thing to do? The spending problem is compounded further when demand is not just driven by one country's business cycle, but by the (nonsynchronized) business cycles of multiple countries, as is the case for tourism marketing aiming to attract tourists originating from different countries. We derive insights into the best way to allocate marketing budgets across countries under varying economic conditions. We show that the allocation decisions are driven by the procyclical versus countercyclical nature of three factors: unit sales, marketing effectiveness, and per-unit profit contribution. To study how unit sales and marketing effectiveness respond to the business cycle, we develop a transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model. We also model the responsiveness of the profit contribution to the business cycle. In an application to New Zealand tourism marketing, we find that a reallocation of the government's marketing budget could yield an increase in tourist revenues of NZD $121 million.</p><p>History: K.

In a recession, good management becomes a survival issue.</p><p>(Economist, The 2002)</p><p>A key conundrum facing organizations is how to adjust marketing budgets in response to the business cycle. Is it better to lift expenditures during contractions (countercyclical spending) or during expansions (procyclical spending)? The recent economic downturn further heightened these marketing-accountability concerns <ref type="bibr">(Marketing Science Institute 2014, p. 6</ref>). During downturns, marketing budgets are typically under pressure, whereas during expansions, there is more scope for increases. This may explain why the predominant pattern observed in practice is to cut advertising support in economically tough times <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Srinivasan et al. 2011</ref> and to increase spending once economic conditions improve. Such procyclical behavior stands in sharp contrast with the recommendations from most academic studies on the issue, which advocate countercyclical spending, i.e., to increase spending during contractions, and to cut back during expansions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Tellis and Tellis 2009</ref>). 1 Following a study on the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditures across 37 countries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deleersnyder et al. (2009)</ref> conclude that ". . . [the company] should implement an advertising strategy that is inelastic-or even anticyclical-with respect to the business cycle" (p. 634, italics added). A similar conclusion is reached in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lamey et al. (2012)</ref>, who study the impact of firms' cyclical marketing conduct on the privatelabel share evolution in over 100 consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories, and conclude "when the economy winds down, manufacturers should try to maintain their current spending or even raise advertising if that is financially feasible" (p. 15, italics added). Also <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Steenkamp and Fang (2011)</ref> recommend countercyclical spending, following their observation (based on a broad cross-section of over 1,000 firms across different industries) that advertising's effectiveness increases in economic downturns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lamey et al. (2007)</ref> favor countercyclical national-brand spending as well, based on Peers, van Heerde, and Dekimpe: Budget Allocation and International Business Cycles <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 792-809, © 2017</ref> 793 the cyclical dependence (found across different countries) of aggregate private-label shares. In a similar spirit, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Talay et al. (2012)</ref> suggest that new products launched during mild recessions lead to higher sales.</p><p>In sum, there is a clear schism between marketing practice and marketing academia. Moreover, different studies offer a different motivation for their recommendation, and focus on the cyclical dependence of either the performance metric or advertising's effectiveness. What is lacking is a formal treatment of what determinants should drive procyclical versus countercyclical spending recommendations. We derive the new insight that whether procyclical or countercyclical marketing spending is preferable for an organization depends on the trade-off between three factors: (i) the sensitivity (elasticity) of unit sales (demand) to the business cycle, (ii) the sensitivity (elasticity) of marketing's effectiveness to the business cycle, and (iii) the sensitivity of the per-unit profit contribution to the business cycle. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows, no past research has considered the normative budget allocation implications of business cycle fluctuations.</p><p>A second contribution is that while the current literature has only looked at one business cycle at a time,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deleersnyder et al.

We derive the allocation of a given marketing budget across countries and show how it depends on the business cycle in these countries. A third contribution is the development of a new market response model. To gauge how unit sales and marketing effectiveness are driven by the businesscycle situation across multiple countries, we need a response model that addresses three key challenges. First, it needs time-varying parameters that are a function of the business cycle. Second, it needs to be able to cope with relatively few (annual) observations, because this is inherent to an empirical setting of (annual) budget allocation in response to the business cycle. Third, it needs to control for the endogeneity of marketing spend. To meet these challenges, we develop a transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model (TF-DHLM). The model extends the dynamic hierarchical linear model (DHLM) by using covariates explaining cross-sectional and longitudinal parameter variation, reflected in the "transfer function" tag. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In the application, we analyze international tourism to New Zealand. Tourism is a major economic sector <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 792-809, © 2017</ref> in the country. It is the second largest export industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Statistics New Zealand 2015)</ref>, making an adequate assessment on how to optimally insulate this sector from economic downturns of paramount importance. For New Zealand, very detailed arrival data are available. Because of the remote island nature of the country, (virtually) all travel is through flights or cruise ships, which enables detailed records of all incoming travel.</p><p>We find substantial variation in marketing effectiveness both across time and across countries. A key finding is that while unit sales move procyclically, marketing effectiveness moves even stronger in the countercyclical direction, whereas the revenue per visitor does not vary significantly with the business cycle. On balance, this implies a recommended countercyclical spending strategy. Furthermore, we find substantial differences between countries in their responsiveness to tourism marketing and in the elasticity of this responsiveness to the business cycle. This offers opportunities for a better allocation of the available budget across target countries. Our analysis suggests that a reallocation of the budget could yield a NZD $121 million annual increase in New Zealand's tourist revenues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Impact of the State of the Economy on Budget Allocation</head><p>We take the perspective of an organization (e.g., a national tourism agency) that sells goods or services (e.g., tourism to a destination country) around the world. We assume that the organization wishes to maximize annual profit. Profit from country i in period t equals unit sales q it (e.g., the number of inbound tourists) times the profit contribution per demand unit p it (e.g., average expenditure per tourist). In the context of international tourism, the expenditures per international visitor equal the profit contribution for the domestic economy because the marginal cost per visitor is (quasi) zero. In other words, profit maximization is the same as revenue maximization in this context. In other contexts, there will often be a nonzero cost, so the profit contribution becomes revenue per unit minus the cost per unit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wright 2009)</ref>. The decision variable is the marketing expenditures for country i in period t (M it ), which is subject to a budget constraint. Quantity M t is the total budget for marketing available for the focal period, which is, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, assumed to be given. Hence, we focus on the budget allocation decisions, rather than on determining its total size, as this is often done at another organizational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Farris and West 2007)</ref>. Also, we look at absolute expenditures because a manager has direct control over these, as opposed to relative expenditures expressed with respect to demand or competitive spending. Finally, we focus on how to allocate marketing budgets cross-sectionally in response to the state of the economy in the different target countries at a given point in time, as this is the type of problem that organizations such as national tourism agencies face. We do not consider how to make provisions in function of the expected future business-cycle evolution in the different countries, as this would entail a need to globally predict the business cycle in the future, a problem macroeconomists have also yet to resolve. Hence, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, we do not consider a multiyear planning horizon.</p><p>For the organization, the key challenge is to allocate its marketing budget across i 1, . . . , n markets to maximize profit Π t in period t maximize</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M it Π t n i 1 p it × q it − n i 1 M it ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>subject to the marketing budget constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">n i 1 M it ≤ M t .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, the recommended expenditures in period t to country i can be shown to equal a fraction s it of the total marketing budget M t , with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s it W it n j 1 W jt ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and W it (the weight for country i) given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W it q * it × ε q * it × p it ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where q * it is the level of optimized unit sales, ε q * it is the elasticity of unit sales with respect to marketing expenditures at the optimum</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ε q * it ∂q it ∂M it M it q * it ,</formula><p>and p it is the per-unit profit contribution. Equation (4) shows, ceteris paribus, that a country obtains a higher allocation if its unit sales q * it are higher, if its responsiveness ε q * it is stronger, and if its profit contribution per unit p it is higher. The intuition is that the marketing expenditure needs to be proportional to the potential profit yield from a country, which is the product of the size of demand, how responsive demand is to marketing, and the per-unit profit contribution.</p><p>In a practical situation, Equation (4) cannot be applied directly, as it describes a relationship where q * it needs to be in its optimum. Therefore, in an applied setting, we need a heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fischer et al. 2011</ref>), which we also use later in Section 6. Equation (4) helps us in understanding the impact of the business cycle on the allocation decision. We define BC it to reflect the business cycle in country i in year t. The partial derivative of the allocation weight s it to the business cycle (∂s it /∂BC it ) tells us whether the weight increases (∂s it /∂BC it &gt; 0) or decreases (∂s it /∂BC it &lt; 0) when the business cycle improves. Ceteris paribus, an increase in weight means that the focal country i in year t should receive a higher fraction of the marketing budget in year t, while a decrease in weight implies a lower fraction.</p><p>We can express the elasticity of the allocation weight The intuition for Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is that given that the allocation weight (Equation (4)) is the product of (i) size of demand, (ii) marketing effectiveness, and (iii) perunit profit contribution, the elasticity of the allocation weight to the business cycle is the sum of the elasticities of (i)-(iii) to the business cycle. Equation (5) shows that the elasticity of the allocation weight ε weight depends on the trade-off among the three components on the right-hand side. Each of these components may vary with the business cycle. As for the first component: in an expansion period, unit sales q * it could be higher, which can be expected for durables <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deleersnyder et al. 2004</ref>) and also for luxury goods such as international tourism. For other products, unit sales may be lower during an economic expansion, as consumers switch away from groceries <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Van Heerde et al. 2013)</ref> or private labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lamey et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lamey et al. , 2012</ref>. Thus, depending on the setting, ε demand may be positive or negative.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ε</formula><p>The second component, demand elasticity for marketing spend ε q * it , may vary as economic conditions change. Two opposing forces are at work. The positive force during an expansion is that consumers have more money to spend <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mehra 2001)</ref>, and/or are more willing to spend it <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Katona 1975)</ref>. This makes them more receptive to marketing investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kamakura and Du 2012)</ref>, and hence ε mark.eff. &gt; 0. The negative force is that during a period of economic expansion, competitors increase their advertising expenditures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref>). This leads to more competition for customers' attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Danaher et al. 2008)</ref>, which could make expenditures during expansions less effective: ε mark.eff. &lt; 0. Also, the price per advertising unit (broadcasting seconds, print pages, . . . ) may go up during expansions, allowing for fewer exposures with the same budget <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Steenkamp and Fang 2011)</ref>, again leading to ε mark.eff. &lt; 0.</p><p>A third component affecting how the allocation weight changes over the business cycle is the profit contribution p it . When there is an expansion and the consumers' willingness to pay goes up, firms may be able to earn higher margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deleersnyder et al. 2004</ref>) and ε profit &gt; 0. Conversely, some firms raise prices and margins during a downturn to make up for the loss in demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Backus and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kehoe 1992, Marn et al. 2003)</ref> and hence ε profit &lt; 0. A downturn may also cause less affluent consumers to stay out of the market, increasing the average willingness to pay or expenditures for the remaining consumers.</p><p>In sum, there are theoretical and practical reasons why each of the three elasticities on the right-hand side of (5) could be negative or positive. Hence to determine how the net allocation weight changes in response to the business cycle, we need models that allow us to estimate the three elasticities: ε demand , ε mark.eff. , and ε profit . We develop these models next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model Development</head><p>Both the elasticity of unit sales to the business cycle (ε demand ) and the elasticity of marketing effectiveness to the business cycle (ε mark.eff. ) require a model where demand is the dependent variable. We develop this model first, after which we present the model for the profit contribution, which allows us to estimate its elasticity to the business cycle, ε profit . 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Demand Model</head><p>The model is for aggregate demand q it in period t to country (market) i. We aim to capture both crosssectional and longitudinal variation in demand and marketing effectiveness. The challenge is to do this in an efficient way, because we essentially need parameters for every time and cross section combination. The model should also allow for covariates explaining longitudinal and/or cross-sectional parameter variation, given our interest in quantifying the impact of the business cycle on marketing effectiveness.</p><p>Even though the business cycle is technically defined through changes in many economic indicators and sectors, it is well accepted that fluctuations in aggregate output are at the core of the business cycle <ref type="bibr">(Deleersnyder et al. 2004, Stock and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Watson 1999)</ref>. A country's business cycle is therefore often inferred from the cyclical component in the country's GDP (typically in per-capita terms). Apart from the business cycle <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 792-809, © 2017</ref> (denoted as BC it ), also the long-run trend in a country's GDP/capita (denoted as EconTrend it ) is likely to drive the overall demand evolution. We will explicitly account for both sources of longitudinal variation in our model specification. Exact operationalizations of both components are provided in Section 4.</p><p>In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, we decompose demand into two components</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q it g i (t) × f i (M it , BC it , H it ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>with g i (t) a growth function describing the underlying demand over time, and f i ( • ) a response function that measures the impact of the business cycle (BC it ), marketing (M it ), and a vector of control variables H it . We can linearize Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) by taking logs of both sides</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ln q it ln g i (t) + ln f i (M it , BC it , H it ).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>For the response function, we adopt a log-log specification</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ln f i (M it , BC it , H it ) θ 1it ln M it + γ 1i ln BC it + ln H it γ 2i + u 1it , (8)</formula><p>where θ 1it is the marketing elasticity for country i and period t. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>) combined with ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ln q it ln g i (t) + θ 1it ln M it + γ 1i ln BC it + ln H it γ 2i + u 1it .</formula><p>(9) Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is a model in levels, which could serve as the main demand model. In many time-series settings (including ours; see Section 4), however, variables are evolving, which means we need to take first differences</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∆ ln q it ln g i (t) − ln g i (t − 1) + θ 1it ∆ ln M it + γ 1i ∆ ln BC it + ∆ ln H it γ 2i + ν 1it .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>For the growth factor g i (t) we use a flexible, yet parsimonious, specification such that the change in the growth from one year to another equals</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ln g i (t) − ln g i (t − 1) θ 0it . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>After substituting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">11</ref>) into (10), we obtain as the final demand model</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∆ ln q it θ 0it + θ 1it ∆ ln M it + γ 1i ∆ ln BC it + ∆ ln H it γ 2i + ν 1it . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>We now discuss the parameter processes for the time-varying intercept θ 0it and the time-varying marketing elasticity θ 1it . We model θ 0it as a function of the economic growth, where economic growth is the yearon-year change in the long-run economic trend (i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∆ ln EconTrend it ln EconTrend it − ln EconTrend it−1 ) θ 0it θ 0t + ψ 0i + ψ 1i ∆ ln EconTrend it + ν 20it .

The error term distributions are discussed in Online Appendix B. In ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">15</ref>), θ 1t captures a general pattern in marketing elasticity, modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">θ 1t θ 1t−1 + ω 2t . (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>This reflects that, over time, there may have been a change in marketing effectiveness that is unrelated to the business cycle. For example, in recent decades, the advertising elasticity in many markets has decreased (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sethuraman et al. 2011)</ref>. This has been attributed to an increased media proliferation, maturing markets, and the rise of the Internet, among others. Since the composite effect of these developments may be nonlinear in nature, we capture this potential change in marketing effectiveness in a flexible way through a random walk in (16).</p><p>In Section 5, we consider, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, two extensions to this base specification: we allow marketing spend to also have an effect in the growth function, and to have dynamic (carryover) effects in the response model.</p></div>

In 2012, tourism income was USD $1.3 trillion, representing 30% of the export of services, and 6% of the total worldwide export (UNWTO 2013a, b). Because of this potential, many governments invest in tourism marketing to promote their country as an attractive travel destination. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Among the biggest spenders are the United Kingdom (USD$160 million), the United States (USD$150 million), and Australia (USD$107 million; Edelson 2012). Even a relatively small country such as New Zealand spends over NZD$73 million (USD$63 million) per year on tourism marketing (Tourism New Zealand 2011). While the total budget is typically a government decision, the subsequent allocation over countries (regions) is performed by statutory entities, such as Brand USA, Tourism Australia, or Tourism New Zealand. We focus on the allocation decision that these entities face.</p></div>

The studies are characterized by a wide variety of choices for the dependent variable, for the drivers that are considered, for the econometric model, for the region that is studied, for the length of the time window, and for the data frequency. At the same time, there are some commonalities across studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Song et al. 2009</ref>, Chapter 1). The most common dependent variable is tourist arrivals. The most commonly included drivers are income in the country of origin, costs of travel to the destination, and the cost of living for tourists in the destination (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crouch 1996)</ref>. Population size is often captured by using per-capita variables <ref type="bibr">(Song et al. 2009, p. 3)</ref>.

In the application, we analyze holiday tourism to New Zealand. The detailed arrival records go back decades and record the purpose of travel (e.g., holiday versus business). This allows us to model the number of holiday visitors, who are most commonly targeted by the country's tourism-marketing efforts. We study the 18 countries with the most arrivals to New Zealand, which, combined, cover more than 85% of the total number of the country's foreign holiday visitors. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> On average, the most visitors came from Australia, followed by the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom (see Online Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">C1</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows for five key markets how visitor numbers to New Zealand have developed over time. The (percapita) numbers from Australia have grown steeply, especially in the past two decades. More recently, the inflow from China has risen spectacularly. Visitor numbers from Japan (the United Kingdom) peaked in the 1990s ( <ref type="formula">2000s</ref>), but have retreated from those heights.</p><p>Visitor numbers from the United States, in turn, show several peaks and troughs over time.

The time series for tourism marketing vary across regions, ranging from a mostly steady increase (Australia) to very strong swings (Asia). In our model, we use the total budget per region as an independent variable (M it ) explaining the visitors per country in the various regions. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Discussions with industry experts confirmed that budgets are indeed set per region rather than per country.

After a logarithmic transformation of the original GDP per-capita series, we extract the cyclical component through the well-known CFfilter <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Christiano and Fitzgerald 2003)</ref>. We next compute the change relative to the most recent trough or peak rather than to the previous year (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lamey et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Van Heerde et al. 2013</ref>.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the business-cycle metric (∆ ln BC it ) for the same five key markets. There are some stark differences between countries in terms of the evolution of their business cycle. Whereas the global financial crisis (2009-2010) caused the deepest trough for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, it was not as severe in China or Australia. Instead, the downturns in these two countries were much more pronounced in the 1980s and 1990s. The timing of peaks and troughs is not entirely synced either. For instance, Japan went through a deep downturn around 1993-1995, whereas Australia experienced a strong upturn in the same period. The correlations between the business cycles range from 0.90 (Malaysia and Thailand) to −0.23 (United States and Indonesia), with an average correlation of 0.36, well below unity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Control Variables</head><p>We also need to control for other important drivers of tourism demand based on the review by <ref type="bibr">Song et al. (2009, Chapter 1)</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">13</ref>) includes a fixed effect for each country of origin (i.e., ψ 0i ) to account for timeinvariant factors, such as the distance to the destination country. Equation (13) also controls for economic growth via ∆ ln EconTrend it , where ln EconTrend it ln GDP it − ln GDP CF, it , and where ln GDP it is the logtransformed GDP per capita and ln GDP CF, it is the cyclical component also used in (24). Equation (12) includes a vector ln H it of three control variables. One is the relative price of the destination country, as is common in the tourism literature <ref type="bibr">(Song et al. 2009, p. 29)</ref>. It is the exchange rate between the country of origin and the destination country, corrected by the consumer price index of both countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Li et al. 2006</ref>). We expect a negative effect of the log relative price (ln Price it ) on the number of visitors. To control for the cost of travel to the destination country, we use the log oil price (ln OilPrice it ). This is a proxy for airline-ticket prices, with an expected negative effect on visitor numbers. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> To capture the availability of travel options to the destination country, we use ln Flights it , the log number of flights per capita from the country of origin to the destination country <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hanssens 1980)</ref>. More access via more flights should enhance the number of visitors. In robustness checks (see Section 5), we extend the set of control variables with the price of competing destinations and lagged tourism marketing expenditures. None of these additional terms is significant.</p><p>For the profit-contribution model (Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">23</ref>)), we include in the vector of control variables ln H 1it the economic trend (ln EconTrend it ), log relative price, and log oil price because these variables are likely to directly impact the (remaining) budgets that visitors can spend.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">C2 and C3</ref> in Online Appendix C give the correlations between the model variables for Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) and (23), respectively. The tables show that a The statistics are reported for the ln-transformed series prior to differencing. b For all years, the annual reports give the total budget, and for most years it gives the regional budgets. The information per region was not available before 1988 and was missing in 1990 and 1992-1994. For the period 1981-1987, we used the observed regional allocation in 1988 to obtain regional budgets, allowing us to retain these initial seven years of data (we checked the appropriateness of this procedure with industry experts). We also ran a robustness check (reported in Online Appendix D) omitting the pre-1988 data, leading to similar findings. We use linear interpolation to obtain regional budgets for 1990 and 1992-1994.</p><p>c Because there are no nonstop flights from Europe to New Zealand, we calculate the relative availability of flights over time by the total number of flights available from the major hubs in the Asian countries and the West Coast of North America (i.e., Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Vancouver). multicollinearity is not a concern since all correlations between independent variables are 0.35 or less in magnitude.</p></div>

(2003)</ref> panel unit-root test to test for stationarity of the variables in the demand model (12). We use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the optimal lag length, with a maximum of seven. We cannot reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root (p &gt; 0.10) for visitor numbers, advertising, number of flights per capita, relative price, and economic trend. After taking first differences, we reject (p &lt; 0.05) the unit-root null, indicating stationarity of the variables in differences. For oil price, we use a regular augmented Dickey-Fuller unit-root test because the series is the same for each country, and conclude that we cannot reject the unit-root null hypothesis (p &gt; 0.10) either. After taking first differences, we again reject the unit-root null (p &lt; 0.05). Hence, all variables enter model (12) in first differences, as expressed by the ∆ symbol. For the profit contribution model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">23</ref>), only 14 observations per series are available. Because of this, we restrict the maximum lag length to one. The unitroot tests conclude that neither ln p it nor the variables in ln H 1it have a unit root (p &lt; 0.05) for these 14 years.

As instrumental variables (IVs), we need variables that correlate with marketing budgets, but that are unlikely to be related to the error term in visitor numbers.

These reorganizations are likely to affect budget decisions, but are not related to changes in demand. As an IV, we use an indicator variable for these reorganizations. In line with the tradition of using IVs based on other markets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nevo 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Ma et al. 2011</ref>, we use the marketing expenditures for the other four regions as IVs, since these are unlikely to affect demand from the focal region. For example, for Australia, these are the expenditures for North America, Europe, Asia, and Japan. These variables serve as independent variables (in first difference) in the system. To avoid overlap between IVs and independent variables elsewhere in the system, we use the expenditures for the other regions observed at t − 2 as IVs.

The European countries, which are the furthest away from New Zealand, tend to be the most receptive to tourism marketing, followed by medium-distance countries in North America and <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 792-809, © 2017</ref> Asia, while the closest neighbor Australia is the least receptive. A tentative explanation for this inverse relationship between distance and effectiveness is that the further away the market, the more novel or exotic the destination country appears, and the more noteworthy its tourism marketing. Also, a larger fraction of the Australian population may already have visited New Zealand, reducing the remaining potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hanssens et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Importantly, the elasticity of tourism-marketing effectiveness to the business cycle is quite large in magnitude, varying between −16.3 for South Korea and −14.2 for Germany. To address the question of whether budgets need to be spent procyclically or countercyclically, we must consider the cyclicality of unit sales, the cyclicality of marketing effectiveness, and the cyclicality of the profit contribution, as argued in Section 2. Empirically, we observe a very interesting mixed case of a procyclical unit sales (ε demand &gt; 0), a countercyclical marketing effectiveness (ε mark.eff. &lt; 0), and a noncyclical per-unit profit contribution (ε profit 0). Evaluating the sum of the three as per Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), we find that the net elasticity is significantly negative for all countries except Australia (last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). A significant negative sum calls for countercyclical spending as the allocation weight decreases in response to the business cycle. As a countercyclical spending in every country may not be practical, we explore in Section 6 how a given budget can best be allocated across countries.

If that is the case, the optimal allocation needs to take the growth elasticity into account as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fischer et al. 2011)</ref>. BM1 extends the model by also including marketing expenditures as a driver of growth in Equation (13). The effect (0.01) is not significant. Another possibility is that marketing spend has a long-term effect, in which case the optimal allocation has to use the long-term elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fischer et al. 2011)</ref>. To test for this possibility, BM2 adds last-year tourism marketing expenditures to the demand model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>)-the effect (0.04) is insignificant. BM3 adds the average price of competing destinations to model (12), leading to an insignificant effect (−0.11) as well. Because none of the benchmarks 1-3 adds a significant effect to the core model, nor do they provide a better fit, we opt to keep the more parsimonious focal model (TF-DHLM).</p><p>BM4 is a simplification of the full model, where only the intercept is time varying, whereas marketing effectiveness is not.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Budget Allocation in Function of the Business Cycle</head><p>We now use the estimates to study the allocation of the tourism marketing expenditures across countries to optimize the overall revenues. We determine the optimal proportion of the total budget to be allocated to each of the five world regions, in line with our institutional setting. We use the optimization heuristic of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref>, as explained in Online Appendix E. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Heerde et al. (2013)</ref>, we compare the prescribed allocation in the recent global financial crisis <ref type="bibr">(i.c., 2009-2010)</ref> to the one in the preceding period of expansion <ref type="bibr">(i.c., 2006-2008)</ref>. On average, all countries experienced an expansion in <ref type="bibr">2006-2008 (i.e</ref>., 1 3 2008 t 2006 ∆ ln BC it &gt; 0, ∀ i) and a contraction in 2009-2010 (i.e., 1 2 2010 t 2009 ∆ ln BC it &lt; 0, ∀ i). The number of years is not the same for the two periods, in line with contractions being typically shorter and more pronounced than expansions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deleersnyder et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Lamey et al. 2007</ref>). a Because of space considerations, we present the elasticity estimates for some illustrative countries in the region. In the optimization, we used the elasticity estimates for each individual country in the region.</p><p>b The unit sales is the lagged number of visitors (i.e., q it−1 ) multiplied by the growth multiplier in the current year (i.e., exp(θ 0it )).</p><p>c The average expenditures are the expectation based on the estimated model.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows, for both periods, five alternative budget allocations. The first is the actual, empirically observed, allocation. The second is an allocation proportional to marketing effectiveness (elasticities), in the spirit of the well-known <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorfman-Steiner (1954)</ref> allocation rule. The third allocation is proportional to the expected unit sales, 13 which could appeal to managers because it is easy to apply, although it does not take differences in marketing effectiveness into account. The fourth one is proportional to the profit contribution. The final allocation is the optimal one, proportional to the product of the marketing elasticity, the expected unit sales, and profit contribution.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows that the five allocations yield quite different recommendations. Australia, for example, received 20.6% of the budget during the expansion period, while the optimal allocation is 45.8%. What happens is that during the expansion, Australia combines high unit sales with a relatively strong marketing elasticity, leading to a high optimal allocation weight. By contrast, Australia's allocation is only 11.0% when based on the elasticity-proportion rule, 32.7% based on the market-size-proportion rule, and 4.2% based on the profit contribution per visitor.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> also documents a substantial difference in the optimal allocation going from the expansion period <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> to the contraction period (2009-2010). For example, the optimal budget allocated to Australia drops from 45.8% to 32.2%, whereas the share for Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 792-809, © 2017</ref>  Note. Results represent the median of a sample of draws, using every 10th draw of all of the draws after burn-in, this gives a sample of 5,000 draws.</p><p>a The revenue figure is obtained by using predicted expenditures per visitor for each country of origin, based on the estimated model.</p><p>North America goes from 6.4% to 14.7%. It is interesting to see to what extent the changes in unit sales and marketing elasticity influence these allocations (remember that the profit contribution is statistically invariant to the business cycle). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows that fluctuations in unit sales are relatively small compared to the fluctuations in marketing elasticity. Hence, to explain what happens to the optimal allocation we need to consider predominantly the elasticity fluctuations. We find that during the contraction, the marketing elasticities increase for both Australia (from 0.085 to 0.153) and North America (from 0.016 to 0.132 for the United States, and from 0.031 to 0.151 in Canada), but the rate of increase is much stronger in North America because the global financial crisis was felt much stronger there than in Australia. Consequently, during the contraction period it becomes relatively more attractive to invest tourism marketing dollars in North America than in Australia, explaining the shift in optimal allocation. Interestingly, the observed allocation percentages are aligned closer with the optimal ones in the contraction than in the expansion period. Thus, Tourism New Zealand seemed to have a better sense of the best way to spend the budget in the recent downturn than in the boom period leading up to it. How much of an impact do the alternative allocations have on arrivals and tourism revenue? For each allocation, we calculate the expected demand. To ascertain the stability of the results, we use 5,000 posterior parameter draws <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Campo et al. 2000)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows the median of the number of arrivals and revenue. For revenue, we also give the comparison of the optimal allocation with the actual outcome and the four alternative allocations. At first glance, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> suggests that the increase that can be realized in terms of expected revenue is rather limited: 2.9% relative to the actual allocation in the contraction period, and 3.2% in the expansion period. This is in line with the flat-maximum principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tull et al. 1986)</ref>, which says that the profit function is quite flat around the optimum. However, in absolute terms, this corresponds to an annual revenue increase of NZD$121 ($106) million in expansion (contraction) years. These are substantial amounts for an annual tourism budget of around NZD$73 million. Moreover, in spite of the underlying parameter uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Campo et al. 2000)</ref>, there is a sizable likelihood (e.g., 84% in the contraction period) that the optimal revenue is higher than the actual amount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Whether procyclical or countercyclical marketing spending is recommended has intrigued marketing scholars and practitioners for decades, resulting in a sharp discord between managerial practices on one hand (procyclical spending) and academic recommendations on the other hand (countercyclical spending). This paper offers new insights to resolve this conundrum. Based on the result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer et al. (2011)</ref> that optimal marketing spending is proportional to the product of (i) size of demand, (ii) marketing effectiveness, and (iii) per-unit profit contribution, we derive the new insight that three factors play a role in determining whether the budget needs to be adjusted procyclically or countercyclically. Those are the cyclicality of demand to the business cycle, the cyclicality of marketing effectiveness, and the cyclicality of the profit contribution. If all three evolve procyclically, spend should be procyclical as well. If all move countercyclically, spend should be countercyclical. If their evolution differs (one or two are pro, the other(s) is (are) counter), the elasticity magnitudes need to be compared, and the directionality (procyclical or countercyclical) of the net elasticity determines which policy is recommended. Importantly, such an opposing evolution is not uncommon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Heerde et al. (2013)</ref>, for example, document that for groceries, unit sales move countercyclically, whereas advertising effectiveness evolves procyclically. In this paper, we find the reverse scenario for international tourism: unit sales develop procyclically, while tourism marketing effectiveness progresses countercyclically, while the perunit profit contribution is noncyclical.</p><p>The derivation of the optimal budget allocation becomes even more complex if an organization has to deal with multiple business cycles, as it should account for both longitudinal and cross-sectional variation in the focal elasticities and unit sales. To achieve this, we develop a transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model. The model allows for a flexible trend in marketing effectiveness over time, and for the potential endogeneity of tourism marketing budgets. Importantly, the transfer function allows us to test the effect of one or more moderators (here, the business cycle) on a response parameter of interest (here, tourism marketing effectiveness). The ability to explain parameter variation over time (rather than just observe it) is an important advantage of the proposed TF-DHLM over a standard DHLM.</p><p>In the application, we analyze the effectiveness of tourism marketing for New Zealand over time and across countries. We find that the tourism marketing elasticity decreased substantially, approximately halving across the considered time span. This is in line with the literature that suggests that advertising elasticity has decreased over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sethuraman et al. 2011)</ref>. In terms of our focal research question, we find that the countercyclicality in marketing effectiveness dominates the procyclicality of unit sales, which combined with a noncyclical profit contribution leads to a recommended countercyclical spending pattern. When looking simultaneously at the business-cycle dependencies across all countries, we find that a careful reallocation of the marketing budget results in a sizable absolute increase in revenues. Given that this is achieved with a constant overall budget, we do not call for spending more (which would play to the often-heard criticism that marketing managers always want to spend more), but for spending the available budget smarter.</p><p>Taking a broader perspective beyond this specific application, we offer a number of learnings to both managers and researchers. As we explained in Section 1, the former tend to cut marketing expenditures during contractions. This is a quite natural and understandable response when demand is shrinking during downturns. Demand is a readily observable metric, and going with the flow (procyclical spending) will likely require less persuasion in the organization than going against the grain (countercyclical spending). Academic research so far often suggests that in fact countercyclical spend is best, but most of this research is based on less readily observable metrics such as marketing effectiveness. What this paper does is show how neither recommendation may be uniformly preferable, as we argue that the net recommendation does not depend just on unit sales nor just on elasticities, but that both should be taken into account, along with changes in profit contribution.</p><p>Limitations and further research. One shortcoming of this study is that the empirical setting limits us in terms of the number of observations (18 countries, 31 years per country). Although these numbers already cover multiple decades and regions of the world, this may have limited the statistical significance of some of the response parameters. This data limitation also precludes the use of more parametrized dynamic models, such as vector error correction models. Another limitation is that we apply our model to only one target country and industry (tourism). The method can be applied to other settings where multiple business cycles are relevant to consider; for example, for companies exporting to different countries or considering expansions into different parts of the world. Further research is required to obtain empirical generalizations in the area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The paper was partly written while the first author was visiting Singapore Management University as the Tommy Goh Visiting Professor in Entrepreneurship and Business.</p><p>Endnotes <ref type="bibr">1</ref> An exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Heerde et al. (2013)</ref>. Based on a study of 150 CPG brands, they find advertising's long-run sales elasticity to be significantly larger in economic expansions, leading them to recommend procyclical spending. 2 This use of the term "transfer function" is consistent with the DLM tradition <ref type="bibr">(West and Harrison 1999, p. 284</ref>). In the time-series literature, "transfer functions" refer to distributed lags <ref type="bibr">(Hanssens et al. 2001, p. 286</ref>).</p><p>3 Because in the empirical setting there are some data limitations for the profit-contribution model, it is less sophisticated than the demand model. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kulendran and Dwyer (2009)</ref>, the marketing expenditures considered are the public funds governments allocate to the promotion of their country as a travel destination. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We checked the International Journal of Research in Marketing, the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Marketing, the Journal of Marketing Research, Management Science, and Marketing Science. Checking all issues since the start of each journal till now, we found only 29 publications (including several one-or two-page research notes) with "tourism," "tourist," or "travel" in the title or as a keyword, where we excluded papers where "travel" was used in a nontouristic sense (e.g., travel costs in retail shopping). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The 18 countries are from different parts of the world: Australia, North America (Canada, United States), Europe (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), and Asia (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The model captures the within-year effect of advertising, which is in line with the empirical generalization that most advertising effects last less than a year <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Leone 1995)</ref>. In Section 5, we also consider a model with an additional lagged marketing variable and find that the parameter is insignificant. Additionally the model has a worse penalized fit (higher deviance information criterion) than the focal model with only the within-year effects. 8 For other contexts (e.g., private-label share), a directionally opposite main effect could be postulated based on prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lamey et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lamey et al. , 2012</ref>. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Other institutional marketing settings are also characterized by such a difference in aggregation level between the dependent (performance) and the independent (advertising) variable. For example, brand performance at a given retailer is often linked to the brand's national advertising support <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gielens 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">or Ter Braak et al. 2013</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We also tried a variant where we multiplied the oil price by the distance to the destination country. Given that distances are constant and given that we use a fixed-effect specification in a log-log model, the coefficient for ln(oil price × distance) is exactly the same as for ln oil price. 11 Significance is determined based on the 95% highest posterior density. In particular, if zero lies in the highest posterior density interval, then the estimate is insignificant.</p><p>12 In an unreported analysis, we found an insignificant effect of tourism marketing on the profit contribution. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Note that we cannot take the current unit sales, as this is the variable we need to optimize. We define the expected sales as the lagged unit sales multiplied with the expected growth multiplier, i.e., exp(θ 0it ).</p></div>			</div>
