<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The past decade has witnessed an astonishing growth of Internet retailing. Online shopping has become a daily phenomenon for some consumers, with estimated U.S. Internet sales growing to $172.9 billion in 2010 and expected to reach $250 billion in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schonfeld 2010)</ref>. This trend is projected to continue, and undoubtedly this rapid growth will attract further competition. For instance, when interested in a laptop computer, a customer can find one at all top Internet retailers (hereafter referred to as "e-tailers"). To remain competitive, e-tailers need to continue looking for ways to incentivize existing customers and to attract new ones.</p><p>Customer preferences and product prices have been documented as the two main factors influencing purchasing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Keeney 1999)</ref>. In practice, e-tailers often motivate customers by recommending products of interest and presenting savings opportunities. For example, online recommendation systems (ORS) regularly use a customer's purchase history and online behaviors, expert evaluations, product characteristics, and customer characteristics to recommend products; retailers often promote merchandise through bundling at lower price <ref type="bibr">(Ansari et al. 2000, Bakos and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brynjolfsson 2000)</ref>. However, the current ORS tend to focus on customers' prior online behavior, with little emphasis on e-tailer profitability or customer savings. Also, the bundles promoted are usually established off-line in advance by e-tailers. Customers do not have the freedom of selecting the content or the total number of items in a bundle. The potential for interactively pricing products in real time is not made available to customers who may be looking for better deals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dana (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elmaghraby and Keskinocak (2003)</ref> point out that the extant literature has not fully incorporated pricing strategies into the Internet environment. The detachment of customers' online behavior from retailers' pricing strategies can lead to limitations. Without incorporating customer preferences and savings concerns, systems designed to maximize e-tailers' profits fail to capitalize on customers' interest and to convert online browsers into buyers, whereas focusing on customer savings without linking them to the e-tailer's profit may improve sales volume but not necessarily a firm's profit. In the traditional cross-selling (e.g., an appliance and its Marketing Science 30(4), pp. 737-752, © 2011 INFORMS extended warranty), customers achieve savings only if they buy the specific package. Such fixed offerings can now be seen as overly rigid because customers receive no savings when a greater number of unbundled products are purchased. To date, e-tailers have implemented a few relatively unsophisticated pricing strategies to encourage customer purchases. For example, Amazon.com's "everyday low price" regularly offers customers to "buy A and get B at an additional 5% off," where the discounted price only links with certain products. Customers gain no savings when other products are chosen.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an online dynamic bundle pricing (ODBP) model for e-tailers to exploit the real-time information available from tracking customers' decision-making processes online. We offer e-tailers an interactive pricing scheme and provide a customized price to enhance consumers' savings and maximize e-tailers' profits in a manner not available to bricks-and-mortar retailers. Customers' online shopping behavior is a multistage process where they sequentially add products to a shopping cart and often buy multiple products in one transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Häubl and Trifts 2000)</ref>. After placing a few products in the shopping cart, a customer may choose to remove certain items. Each "add" or "delete" event would update the shopping cart and advance the customer's shopping process to the next "stage." Based on customers' online behavior (e.g., clicking on Web pages, rating products, and/or adding friends in their online social networks), the ORS can capture these real-time events, estimate customers' preferences, update customer models, and generate new recommendation lists. For each recommended item, the ODBP model determines the bundle price by combining the new product with the products already in the cart. Because the bundle price will inherently be cheaper than the sum of the individually posted prices (the standalone selling price) shown on the e-tailer's website, customers are enticed to buy more products in one transaction.</p><p>Based on the data collected from Amazon.com and through a numerical study, we found the proposed approach is a "win-win" strategy because the ODBP model provides more profits for e-tailers and extra savings for customers. The contributions of the proposed model are threefold.</p><p>1. The model considers customer preferences, customer savings, and e-tailer profits. Compared with existing methods that explore the three aspects independently (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bodapati 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Geng et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Ghosh and Balachander 2007</ref>, the ODBP model should attract more customers because of its emphasis on customers' savings. Also, because the optimization model focuses on profit maximization and balances between discounts and profits, the price cut will not come at the expense of e-tailer's earnings because of higher sales volume.</p><p>2. Traditional pricing models regard customers' purchasing behavior as a buy-or-not-buy one-stage decision process. Our model more realistically allows customers to explore as many times as they please, in terms of the number and variety of products. The ODBP model allows e-tailers to instantaneously provide an attractive discount for any selected product mix. Incorporating real-time pricing capability significantly enhances the information available and provides better customer service.</p><p>3. The optimization model and heuristics developed in this paper advance the viability of online pricing. It achieves near-optimal solutions in a negligible time that satisfy the real-time interactive environment while helping customers to make better decisions.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §2 we review the literature and identify the unique characteristics of our model; §3 proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and solution methodology to interactively solve the online adaptive bundle pricing problem. A computational study is conducted in §4 to understand the benefits of the proposed ODBP model. In §5 we conduct sensitivity analyses and examine the robustness of the model. A summary, conclusions, and future research are given in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Customers are key to a firm's survival; as a result, several methods have been proposed to attract new patrons and to maintain old ones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lu and Moorthy (2007)</ref> study the application conditions of coupons and rebates, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Subramaniam and Venkatesh (2009)</ref> employ auction-based models. Among the available tactics, ORS and pricing strategies are two effective approaches that are gaining popularity. In this section we review the theoretical and practical models of both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Online Recommendation Systems</head><p>An ORS is a decision aid that analyzes customers' prior online behavior and suggests products to meet the needs of a particular customer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ansari et al. 2000)</ref>. Most ORS gather data to extract information and to understand customer preferences, and then they recommend the products most likely to be purchased by the customer based on her preferences as expressed through her online behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Huang et al. 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ansari et al. (2000)</ref> point out that an ORS should integrate five types of information: preferences of target customers (by detecting customer's purchase history and online behavior), preferences of other customers, expert evaluations, product characteristics, and customer characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>739</head><p>To improve customer acceptance of an ORS, some researchers have focused on ORS design issues to enhance customers' shopping experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cooke et al. 2002)</ref>, whereas others have examined the impact of recommendation systems on a customer's buying decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fitzsimons and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lehmann 2004, Fleder and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hosanagar 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A practical online shopping aid should consider both customer need and e-tailer want <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bohte et al. 2004</ref>). To date, most systems focus on predicting customers' preferences rather than customers' savings and e-tailers' profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garfinkel et al. 2008</ref>. Currently, none of the ORS or shopbots (price comparison services) has been developed with such integration. Thus, the existing systems are less successful in translating recommended products into sales than the market potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Wu et al. 2008</ref>. These findings motivate us to integrate all these aspects into one model so as to address the concerns of both e-tailers and customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Price Differentiation and Bundle Pricing</head><p>Price differentiation has been adopted in a number of industries because it is an important strategy that both aids customer retention and creates a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sahay 2008)</ref>. All else being equal, economists favor price discrimination (differential pricing) because it is generally welfare-enhancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Varian 1985)</ref>. There are three degrees of price discrimination. The first degree relies on consumer identification. Because it appears discordant with current views on privacy, it is the least likely to be adopted. Second-degree discrimination is based on different product versions or quantities and is a more easily justifiable and publicly acceptable method. Using observable group characteristics, third-degree discrimination separates the market into segments, e.g., business versus leisure classes, to maximize a seller's profit. It is also a relatively common market practice. E-tailers may change prices, either across customers or across products, by dynamically updating the posted prices or by offering auctions or quantity discounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kannan and Praveen 2001)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jain and Kannan (2002)</ref> study the pricing strategies for information goods online. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Khouja and Park (2007)</ref> propose that customers with different attitudes toward piracy be charged differently for digital goods such as music and video. In our model, the price difference is due to product variety and quantity chosen, an example of second-degree price discrimination.</p><p>With an aim of selling two or more products jointly, bundling is another attractive marketing practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ghosh and</ref><ref type="bibr">Balachander 2007, Venkatesh and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mahajan 1993)</ref>. Bundle researchers determine whether products should be sold as pure components (only individual products), pure bundling (only bundle), or mixed bundling (individual and bundle), as well as the corresponding pricing. Others subject bundling to the constraints of customer demand, arrival process, supply information, and fixed-price bundles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bakos and Brynjolfsson 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Basu and Vitharana 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Hitt and Chen 2005</ref>. Our multistage online pricing system allows customers to interactively select the products of their choice and provides shoppers with a dynamic price menu in real time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Distinctive Features of Our ODBP Model</head><p>The ODBP model proposed in this research contains a number of distinctive characteristics compared with prior work. First, the model emphasizes motivating customers, because emphasizing only profits without inspiring customers to participate is less likely to improve sales, ceteris paribus. Given the posted prices of the recommended products, the ODBP determines the bundle prices most likely to entice customers and to generate profits. Second, traditional pricing models regard customers' purchasing behavior as a one-stage process, where they decide whether or not to buy a product or a bundle as a single decision. However, given that online shopping is a multistage process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Häubl and Trifts 2000)</ref>, a method to attract customers at each interactive stage becomes much more relevant.</p><p>Our model allows shoppers to realistically have flexibility and choice in terms of when and what to put in their shopping cart. The model incorporates customers' views and seeks savings for customers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction with the likely concomitant increase in e-tailers' sales. Compared with cross-selling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Netessine et al. 2006)</ref>, our bundles are formed freely by online shoppers and are guaranteed to derive savings every time a new item is added to the cart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Online Dynamic Bundle</head><p>Pricing Model</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Problem Description and Model Assumptions</head><p>In this section we formulate the ODBP problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model for e-tailers. Before detailing the model, we first discuss four model assumptions. (i) Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al. (2008)</ref>, we assume the default reservation price for a bundle is the sum of the reservation prices of individual products in the bundle. For products with dependent reservation prices, e-tailers can employ the superadditive or subaddititive methods to increase or decrease the reservation prices for the bundle <ref type="bibr">Kamakura 2003, Jedidi et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>(ii) Customers' purchasing decisions are governed by their consumer surplus, defined as the reservation price minus the price paid. Customers would prefer a product (bundle) that has the highest consumer Marketing Science 30(4), pp. 737-752, © 2011 INFORMS surplus. (iii) Because the individual posted price is a function of market competition and demand popularity, we deem it the retailer's optimal price that generates the highest possible profit when sold alone. Methods for establishing optimal posted prices can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCardle et al. (2007)</ref>. 1 (iv) Customers have budget limits that restrict their ability to pay. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ulkumen et al. (2008)</ref> for methods to estimate customer budgets. Two types of data are needed for our model. One is product information, e.g., product cost, posted price, and shipping rate. The other is customer information, e.g., purchasing history and reservation price. On the individual level, the shopper's online interaction with the system, such as shopping cart contents, needs to be tracked. At the group level, e-tailers have to survey or analyze past data to estimate reservation prices, budgets, and customers' shipping preferences. Of course, sufficient transaction records are necessary to generate online recommendations to customers. However, these data are increasingly available in online environments.</p><p>To estimate customers' reservation prices, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wertenbroch and Skiera (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jedidi et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang et al. (2007)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bitran and Ferrer (2007)</ref> have proposed several practical methods. For mature products that have known prices and demand records, e-tailers can use the posted price to approximate the reservation price (see Footnote 1). For new products, e-tailers could first estimate reservation prices through a market survey and later adjust them according to the customer's response to the price changes and market condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jedidi and Zhang 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Proposed ODBP Model</head><p>Suppose an e-tailer has N products and M potential customers who might patronize the business <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al. 2008, Venkatesh and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kamakura 2003)</ref>. Each product has a posted price, and different customers have different reservation prices for each product. Suppose I products are already in the shopping cart, G S = g S 1 When customers' reservation prices for product g n follow the distribution f x between [r l , r u ], e-tailers' profits can be determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Profit n = M × r u p n f x dx × p n − c n . Function f x can be U u − b u + b , N u 2 ,</formula><p>or other shapes. The value of M × r u p n f x dx corresponds to the actual demand of product g n when market size is M and g n is sold at price p n . The optimal selling price p * n can be found at the point that maximizes profit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Profit * = Max p n M × r u p n f x dx × p n − c n .</formula><p>the products to ship, the customer's shipping option (e.g., express or ground shipping), and the e-tailer's shipping rate. Once the customer places products into the shopping cart and selects a shipping option, the shipping fee of the order can be determined. The bundle price of the shopping cart is p S , and p S = p S 1 if there is only one product in the shopping cart. Based on customer's online behavior and the products in G S , ORS recommends an additional J products, I , g R j }, and we determine the best bundle price that would win over a customer purchase while generating profit for the e-tailer. In all, J different new bundles are formed and J bundle prices are calculated by the ODBP in each shopping stage. Customers will presumably pick one out of the J candidate new bundles and continue to the next shopping stage. We use X m , a binary decision variable, to denote whether customer m will purchase the specific bundle under consideration. Another decision variable, p, is the bundle price for the bundle {g S 1 g S i g S I , g R j }. X m is dependent on the price p. The percentage of customers who actually made the purchase among all M shoppers is M m=1 X m /M. In addition, p −i is the bundle price before product g S i is added to the bundle; i.e., p −i is the price of bundle {g S 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G R = g R 1 g R j g R J }.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">g S i−1 , g S i+1 g S I g R j }</formula><p>. The notations necessary to formulate the ODBP model are listed in the appendix.</p><p>The objective of the ODBP model is to maximize profit for the e-tailer when recommending product g R j to potential customers who have already picked G S . Thus, the e-tailer's profits are the sum of profits obtained from all customers who would choose to buy g R j and Gs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">max M m=1 p − I u=1 c S u + c R j X m (1)</formula><p>The profit obtained from each customer is the difference between the bundle price (p) and the total bundle cost, which includes the cost of all products already in the cart, I u=1 c S u , and the cost of the newly recommended product, c R j . The binary variable X m in the objective function ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) equals 1 if customer m chooses to buy the bundle {g S 1 g S i g S I , g R j } at price p, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, among the M shoppers in the market, only those with decision variables X m equal to 1 are the actual buyers.</p><p>A serious difficulty faced by firms is that deep discounts offered to boost sales do not drive enough traffic volume to generate a profit. To avoid such a predicament, we carefully incorporate both product costs and customers' reservation prices into the proposed ODBP model by employing nine constraints. Constraints (2)-( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) determine whether customers would be interested in buying the bundle at price p. The reservation prices for all products customer m placed in the shopping cart is I g R j } at price p and paying shipping fee f m . To attract customer m to buy the recommended g R j , the customer's surplus derived from G S ∪ g R j } has to be greater than that generated by buying g R j alone at the posted price. In other words, the consumer surplus of the new bundle should be no less than that of g R j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I u=1 r S m u + r R m j − p − f m − r R m j − p R j − f R m j X m ≥ 0 m = 1 M (2)</formula><p>Similarly, customer m's surplus derived from the bundle has to be at least equal to that of buying g S i individually. Only when the consumer surplus from the bundle is no less than that of purchasing the individual item at price p S i would the customer keep g S i in the bundle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I u=1 r S m u + r R m j − p − f m − r S m I − p S i − f S m I X m ≥ 0 i = 1 I m = 1 M (3)</formula><p>In constraints (4), customer m would buy the bundle only if her reservation price for the bundle is no less than her expenses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">I u=1 r S m u +r R m j −p −f m X m ≥ 0 m = 1 2 M (4)</formula><p>Constraints ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) ensure that customer m's actual expenditure is no more than her budget b m ; otherwise, customers cannot afford the products:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p + f m − b m X m ≤ 0 m = 1 2 M (5)</formula><p>When adding product g R j to the shopping cart, constraint (6) ensures that the marginal bundle price (p − p s for the newly recommended product, g R j , is no more than its posted price. It would be irrational to pay a higher marginal price for g R j in the bundle than to buy the item separately:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p − p S − p R j ≤ 0 (6)</formula><p>Besides adding product g R j to the shopping cart, there are an additional I ways to form bundle {g S 1 g S i g S I g R j }. That is, instead of having g R j as the last item to be added into the cart, customers may actually add g S i to the cart that already contains {g S 1 g S i−1 g S i+1 g S I g R j }. Recall that we let p −i be the bundle price of {g S 1 g S i−1 g S i+1 g S I g R j }. Constraints ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) ensure that the marginal bundle price p − p −i is no more than its posted price p S i The bundle prices for all I cases in Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) are the same, because the same contents {g S 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">g S i−1 g S i g S i+1 g S I g R j }</formula><p>are in the bundle. The cart-entering sequence of products i does not affect the bundle price:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p − p −i − p S i ≤ 0 i = 1 I (7)</formula><p>Given constraints ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and possible economies of scale in shipping, i.e., f S m i + f S m −i ≥ f m , we found customer m's surplus derived from the bundle is at least equal to the sum of the surplus of buying g S i individually and that of buying other products in the bundle</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">{g S 1 g S i−1 , g S i+1 g S I g R j }; i.e., I u=1 r S m u + r R m j − p − f m ≥ r S m i − p S i − f S m i + i−1 u=1 r S m u + I u=i+1 r S m u + r R m j − p −i − f S m −i , where f S m −i is m's shipping charge for products {g S 1 g S i−1 , g S i+1 g S I g R j }</formula><p>. Constraint (8) guarantees that the bundle price is no less than the total cost of the products in the bundle.

According to the customer's online browsing and purchasing behavior, the e-tailer can also rematch the customer to the appropriate customer segment in real time. This way, when the online information tracked suggests that the customer may be willing to pay more (or less) than others for that item, the customer's reservation price distributions can be revised accordingly, and the ODBP can thus set the bundle price in accordance with customer's online behavior and willingness to pay. In short, when adopting first-degree price discrimination, or when engaging in target recommendations, the ODBP implementation is unchanged except for the segment match and real-time update of the reservation price distributions. Market survey data and tracked online information are key inputs to dynamically determine the reservation price distribution and thus the bundle price for potential customers.</p></div>

Suppose the e-tailer sells eight products (A-H) with posted prices (p R j of $9.00, $11.99, $16.47, $13.72, $7.53, $6.59, $14.75, and $15.63, respectively. The shopper's reservation price for each product is shown in the second row of each subtable. For ease of illustration, we assume the shopper chooses ground shipping and the shipping fee is $3 00+$0 99× number of products. The Marginal_price_UBL is the stand-alone posted price plus the marginal shipping fee ( = p R j + $0 99), and the Marginal_price_BL is the change in bundle price from last stage plus the marginal shipping fee ( = p − p s + $0 99).</p><p>After the shopper logs on, the ORS recommends products {A, B, C} based on the customer profile and shopping history. To maximize consumer surplus $16 − $11 99 − $3 99 shipping fees), the shopper selects B. At this point, she may either check out or continue. If she chooses to continue, the ORS recommends {A, C, D}, and the ODBP instantly determines the optimal bundle price for {B, A}, {B, C}, and {B, D}, whose corresponding marginal bundle prices are $8.69, $17.18, and $14.51, respectively. Note that without the bundle discount, the shopper will not buy product A because of the associated negative consumer surplus $9 50 − $9 99 . However, because the marginal price of the bundle ($8.69) is smaller than her reservation price ($9.50) for product A, she is better motivated to buy the bundle. By applying the maximum consumer surplus rule, she will choose A among the recommended {A, C, D}, and again in stage 3, she will choose F owing to its maximum surplus.</p><p>After adding products B, A, and F to the shopping cart, the customer, now in shopping stage 4, may decide to remove A. Once again, the ODBP is applied to determine the bundle price for {B, F}. Thereafter, the ORS may recommend products {C, E, H} 2 in stage 5.</p></div>

For example, to a Hewlett-Packard laptop, an Acer Laptop is a substitute (relation 1), an MP3 player is an independent product (relation 2), and a notebook case is a complement (relation 3). Customers generally buy only one of the substitutes at a time, not both.

Because conventional optimization techniques such as relaxation and decomposition methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nowak 2005</ref>) are relatively slow and cannot solve our problem in real time, we propose a quasi-optimal method to achieve a near-optimal solution, as outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and described next.</p><p>3.4.1. The Quasi-Optimal Method. Although solving small-sized nonlinear mixed-integer programming problems with optimization software is possible, a drawback is that they are generic tools and do not consider the special structure of the problem in question. Consequently, they require a relatively long solution time. In the online shopping environment, a   waiting time of more than a few seconds is unacceptable and may cause customers to renege. Therefore, rapid response time is essential.</p><p>To promptly determine the optimal bundle price p for {g S 1 g S i g S I g R j }, we need to establish the prices of p −i for i = 1 2 I. This requires repetitive execution of the procedures in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, with I−1 v=2 I C v + 1 nested loops to arrive at the solution. Clearly, this would be a time-consuming procedure. To make it practical for an online real-time application, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic method in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> to establish the price for p −i , which is then used to replace p −i in Step 2 of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>

We also investigate the computational efficiency of the proposed heuristics so as to understand its suitability for online real-time implementation.</p><p>4.1. The Data Sets and Experiment Procedure 4.1.1. Posted Price and Product Costs. Data of the top-100-ranked books from Amazon.com, including book titles and posted prices, were collected in April 2010. Although Amazon.com knows the exact costs of their products, because of commercial confidentiality, we are not able to obtain this information. We therefore follow the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sampson 2007)</ref> and assume book costs are uniformly distributed at U(0.60, 0.80) of the posted price. Impacts of potential cost variation on e-tailer profits are examined in §5.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Reservation Prices.</head><p>Reservation prices have been widely used in the literature to develop customized pricing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen and Iyer 2002)</ref> and auction strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yao and Mela 2008)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al. (2008)</ref>, we assume customers' reservation prices are uniformly distributed, U r l r u . The prices posted by Amazon.com are assumed to give optimal profit because they are the results of market competition. For uniformly distributed reservation prices, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCardle et al. (2007)</ref> show that the optimal selling price p n equals the average of the upper bound of reservation price and the product's cost; i.e., p * n = r u + c n /2. The upper bound of the reservation price thus can be derived by r u = 2 × p n − c n . As for the lower bound of reservation prices, we let r l = 1 − × p n , with being the range index that signifies the degree of heterogeneity in customers' valuation of the product. Profits are generated when a customer's reservation price is greater than p n ; any reservation price lower than p n will not generate revenue for the e-tailer. A larger gives a smaller r l , which corresponds to a wider dispersion of reservation prices.</p><p>Using Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers: The Story of Success 3 as an example, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows three different uniform reservation price distributions, with = 0 15 0 20 0 25 and p n being $13.72. By assuming p n is the optimal price, we found r u = 2 × p n − c n = $16 60, and the lower bounds computed by r l = 1 − × p n are <ref type="bibr">($11.66, $10.98, $10.29)</ref>, respectively. The probabilities corresponding to areas a b c are 0 58 0 51 0 46 , indicating the chance of selling at p n = $13 72 under different customer valuations. The small probability in c indicates that at a high , fewer customers will buy the product at p n . 4.1.3. Shipping Charge. Consistent with Amazon .com, we assume three shipping options: next-day, two-day, and ground shipping. Shipping charges are determined by Shipping fee per order = "Per shipment" charge + No. of items per order × "Per item" fee</p><p>The "Per shipment" charges by Amazon.com for the ground, two-day, and next-day shipping are ($3.00, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Published in 2008 by Little, Brown, New York. $9.99, $12.99), and the "Per item" fees are ($0.99, $1.99, $4.99), respectively. To be consistent with our survey results 4 that buyers often choose ground shipping when shopping online, and that only a few opt for express shipping, the percentages of customers who require ground, two-day, and next-day shipping are estimated at 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Improvement of E-tailer Profit and</head><p>Customer Savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2008)</ref> suggest that customers, in general, order no more than eight items in one transaction. We thus assume the bundle size follows U 1 8 and use the item-to-item collaborative filtering technology of Amazon.com <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Linden et al. 2003)</ref> to make recommendations. As in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, each customer starts with a list of recommendations and selects the product that gives her the highest consumer surplus. From that, the ORS generate another recommendation list, the ODBP determines the corresponding prices, and the consumer picks a product to add to the shopping cart. The process continues until she checks out. Customers may pick items not recommended and can leave the process at any time.</p><p>To examine the benefit of adopting ODBP, we let M, the market population, equal 500. Note that M could assume any number. However, a larger M takes a longer time to replicate. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, column (1) displays the e-tailer's total profits when buyers pay at Amazon's prices, and column (2) gives the e-tailer's total profits when buyers pay the ODBP bundle prices. The positive values of percentage of profit improvement in column (3) indicate that the ODBP outperforms its counterpart in profit generation, whereas column (6) represents the average customer savings in dollars. In addition, we found that profits and savings increase with the bundle size. For example, the percentage of profit improvement increases from 121% (= 860 69 − 389 41 /389 41 to Marketing Science 30(4), pp. 737-752, © 2011 INFORMS 386.4% = 6 545 49 − 1 345 65 /1 345 65 when bundle size rises from two to eight. Similarly, the average savings per customer increases from $3.13 to $12.78 (see column ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)), whereas the number of new buyers increases from approximately 358.3% to 844.3% (see column ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)). Because customers' purchasing decisions are influenced by price and shipping cost, offering savings opportunity for larger bundles is effective. Rational customers are better motivated to buy larger orders under the ODBP discounts. Thus, although unit profit decreases, overall profits increase as a result of larger volume. The sizeable increase in profit provides a convincing argument as to the attractiveness of the ODBP strategy and gives e-tailers a clear incentive to adopt the model.</p><p>To ensure prompt response for the online environment, we replace Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> for p −i in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that for small bundle, both the quasi-optimal method (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and the heuristics-based method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>) require comparable computation time. However, when the bundle size increases, the computational efficiency of the heuristic-based method is much more pronounced. The heuristic-based method improves computational efficiency by up to 99.8% while maintaining the same solution quality (see the rightmost two columns). We thus adopt the more efficient heuristic-based method to solve the ODBP model and for our sensitivity analysis. Notes. The quasi-optimal method is given in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The heuristic-based method uses Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> to replace p −i in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>We investigate the robustness of the ODBP by examining how uncertainties in input parameters affect the model performance. We first study the impacts of changes in the range and shape of customer reservation price distribution on e-tailer and customers. We subsequently examine the sensitivity when customers employ different purchase decision rules and when their budgets vary. Next, we analyze how changes in product cost ratios affect the e-tailer's profitability. Finally, a multiple-factor sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the overall model robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Changes in the Range of Reservation Prices</head><p>The range index, , is used to measure the heterogeneity of customers; a larger indicates widerranging views of merchandise value. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the simulated e-tailer profits and customer savings under different s. A larger corresponds to higher percentage of profit improvement because more customers will regard the product as low value (see <ref type="bibr">Figure 4)</ref>. Correspondingly, fewer customers are willing to pay for the product at the posted price. This implies that the price discount from a large bundle has a better chance to attract previously uninterested customers in the market. Therefore, the percentage of profit improvement under a higher and a larger bundle size is more significant. Similarly, customer savings show the same trend; e.g., for the eight-product bundle, customer savings is $14.72 at = 0 25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Changes in the Distributions of</head><p>Reservation Price In §4.1.2 we assume that the posted price is optimal when reservation prices are uniformly distributed, and from this we determine r u . To make a fair comparison when reservation prices follow different distributions, we derive the optimal posted prices based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCardle et al. (2007)</ref>; i.e., Profit * = Max p n M × r u p n f x dx × p n − c n . Four cases are examined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. The reservation prices in Case 1 follows N u 2 , with u = (r u +r l /2 and = r u −r l /4. Case 2 is a uniform distribution. Case 3 allocates 30% of its products' reservation price to the normal distribution and the other 70% of its products to the uniform distribution. Case 4 is the inverse of Case 3. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, regardless of distribution type, ODBP universally outperforms the unbundling strategy, as evidenced by the positive improvements. Under the same bundle size, the values are comparable among all cases. However, the performance improves with the bundle sizes; e.g., for the eightproduct bundle in Case 4, the percentage of profit improvement using ODBP is 312.1% and the customer savings is $10, much higher than those of the twoproduct bundle. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Changes in Purchase Decision Rules</head><p>A customer's purchase decision is a complex process and may be influenced by the seller's marketing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bodapati 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Sun 2005</ref>) and the consumer's ability to process the product information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Sriram et al. 2010</ref>). When multiple alternatives from which to choose are available, a customer's purchase decision may be affected by factors such as the e-tailer's recommendation strategy <ref type="bibr">(Cooke et al. 2002, Fitzsimons and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lehmann 2004)</ref>, coupons or rebates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lu and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moorthy 2007, Gönül and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Srinivasan 1996)</ref>, and website style <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hauser et al. 2009</ref>). To examine whether the ODBP remains valid under different purchase decision rules, we vary the rule from maximizing consumer surplus to maximizing price savings, defined as the sum of posted price minus bundle price. We found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> that, although customers receive slightly better savings when applying the "max price savings" rule because of its direct focus on price, e-tailers can nonetheless obtain comparable percentage of profit improvements when customers employ the surplus rule. This is because the customer's price savings do not automatically counteract the e-tailer's profit margin (bundle price − bundle cost), and therefore applying the max price savings rule does not necessarily cause more profit decline for e-tailers than applying the surplus rule. Overall, purchase decision rules do not significantly affect the e-tailer's profit or customer savings.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Changes in Budget Level</head><p>Suppose that customers' budgets follow a normal distribution N u b , 2 , with 2 = 0 2 × u b . We vary u b from $80 to $160, and Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows such effects. Limited by budgets, customers cannot afford certain products even though their reservation prices are high. Therefore, relative to no budget limitation, the e-tailer's overall profits will fall. For small bundles the percentage of profit improvements at low budget are comparable with that of unlimited budgets. This is because even with a low budget, customers who are interested in only few products can still afford to buy. Therefore, unlimited budgets do not attract many more buyers for small bundles, and thus no extra profits. However, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that when the bundle size is large, the percentage of profit improvement is more significant under the lower budget situation; e.g., the profit improvement for the eight-product bundle is 801.0% when u b is 100, but it is only 537.9% when u b is 140. For the larger bundle size the ODBP has more room to offer savings opportunities, which, in turn, bring more sales and make more profits. The simulation results indicate that our model performs significantly better when the budget is tight. This implies that the ODBP is more valuable in improving e-tailers' profit when customers' purchasing power decreases, as in an economic downturn. E-tailers should provide greater discounts during recessions when consumer budgets are low, as might be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Changes in the Cost Ratio of Products</head><p>The e-tailer's cost ratio (unit cost/posted price) is varied from 60% to 80% in increments of 5%. Because the e-tailer has limited room to earn profit when the cost ratio is high, the dollar profit decreases at the rise of the ratio (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(a)). However, the percentage improvement by ODBP grows as the ratio increases (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>(b)). At a high cost ratio, e-tailers often charge a higher price, which, in turn, deters potential buyers. Using the ODBP bundle discount, the e-tailer could attract more customers, boost sales volume, offset the high costs, and continue to make profits.</p><p>The above experiments show that the ODBP is most effective when customers have a diverse view about The Impact of E-Tailer's Cost Ratio 0 1,000 Bundle size = 8 the value of the product (high ), when customers' budgets are low, and when the cost ratio is high. It is relatively indifferent to the distribution of reservation prices and to the customer's purchase decision rules. To understand the ODBP's overall quality in withstanding uncertainties in different environments, we next conduct a multifactor sensitivity analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Multifactor Robustness Study</head><p>The ODBP is deemed robust if it can cope with significant uncertainty in its operating environment. Using a 3 4 × 2 sensitivity analysis, we conduct 162 experiments for each bundle size to concurrently test five factors: (i) reservation price distribution, (ii) reservation price range, (iii) product cost ratio, (iv) customer budget, and (v) purchase decision rule (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>). The quantitative factor levels assumed in §4 are varied by ±15% of their average values. The corresponding factor levels for the experiment are as follows: distribution = [Uniform, Normal, Mixed (=0.5U&amp;0.5N)], = 0 17 0 20 0 23 , cost ratio = 0 595 0 70 0 805 , and budget = 76 5 90 103 5 , as  well as the purchase decision rule at two levels: [max consumer surplus, max price savings]. Each experiment (scenario) corresponds to a unique combination of these factors. For example, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> the first experiment uses a uniformly distributed reservation price, with = 0 23, cost ratio = 0 805, customer budget = $76 5, and the max price savings decision rule. The profit improvements are shown in the three rightmost columns, whose complete values are graphically displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows that the highest profit improvement is $2,882 under the four-product bundle case, whereas the smallest is $222 under the two-product bundle case. For ease of illustration and clarity, we only show the results of bundle sizes of two to four products. Similar patterns are found for the bundle sizes of five to eight products, i.e., the profit improvements are all positive, and again increase with bundle size.</p><p>This sensitivity analysis suggests that the ODBP model is robust under various bundle sizes and scenarios. As far as the percentage of profit improvement is concerned, we found that when facing divergent views about product values, lower budgets, and higher cost ratios, the ODBP performs significantly better, whereas the customers' purchase decision rule is inconsequential, as is the reservation price distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>Attractive and profitable pricing is essential for business survival and success. This paper provides a new approach to promote online customer spending by offering interactive bundling and pricing, contingent on the products chosen by shoppers at various browsing stages. Product bundling is a widely used tactic for differential pricing. But because the number of bundles increases exponentially with the number of products, pricing all possible bundle combinations and displaying them off-line is a practical impossibility. As a result, traditional pricing strategies prespecify discount rates, bundle sizes, and bundle contents in promotions. Such approaches severely limit the choices to customers, and their application online would squander the valuable information available from the interactive shopping environment.</p><p>The method we propose starts with an insight into consumer motivation and ends in a stream of profit enhancement. It includes product selection flexibility in terms of bundle size and product variety, coupled with a dynamic pricing model that integrates customers' preferences, customers' savings, and e-tailers' profits. Furthermore, the incorporation of customers' multistage purchasing behavior in the decision process and the development of the heuristics afford the ODBP model the capability to provide real-time online pricing information that appeals to customers regardless of the mixture of the products they choose.</p><p>The proposed model ensures that the price presented online is independent of the sequence of products entering into the shopping cart-customers see the same price for the same bundle. Any product combination is allowed in the shopping cart, and an extra discount is guaranteed when additional products are selected. The price of the customized bundle can be prompted instantaneously online. To sensibly implement the proposed model, we design a heuristic-based solution procedure that is capable of arriving at a near-optimal bundle price with negligible computation time. The numerical studies show that the proposed model is a win-win strategy. It offers monetary savings for customers, enhances product differentiation with numerous discount scenarios, helps firms gain competitive advantage, and ultimately enhances e-tailers' profits.</p><p>In terms of future research, one possibility is that in actual applications, e-tailers may adjust the selling price according to their inventory level. They could provide a bigger discount when the inventory level of a product is high and a smaller discount when the inventory level is low. Incorporating a product's inventory level to the dynamic bundle pricing strategy could be a future extension to our model. Of course, such an extension would only be of value for sellers of tangible goods. Sellers of digital goods, e.g., information goods such as software, videos, news reports, stock prices, etc would not have inventories subject to this type of constraint.</p><p>Another possible extension is to link the ODBP model with other marketing strategies, such as coupon offering. For sellers to make the optimal coupon-offering decision endogenously, it is necessary to have information about the market response of the deal-prone segment, the number of customers who are loyal to the brand, the profit margin, and the cost of managing coupons. Integrating a couponoffering decision with the ODBP sequential bundle pricing model through understanding the market structure would be an important and interesting research topic.</p><p>Because reservation price is a cornerstone to pricing decision, a third research extension could be improving the estimation of the consumer reservation price. The current literature offers useful guidelines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Venkatesh and Kamakura 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Jedidi et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Wang et al. 2007</ref>. But, for the online environment, e-tailers should also exploit the readily available information such as consumer ratings, feedback, and competitors' pricing when estimating reservation prices for bundling policy and marketing strategy.</p><p>In addition to these specific research extensions to the model, greater effort could be focused on more tightly integrating the ODBP model with continuing research in ORS. For example, ORS can update recommendation lists according to customers' online behavior, such as clicking on Web pages, rating products, and adding friends in their online social networks.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a burst of online retailing activities. As is typical in the adoption of information technology, the initial implementation tends to model the virtual world rather strictly after its real-world analogue. As e-commerce progresses, we expect e-tailers to actively take advantage of the unique characteristics of the online environment and, in particular, the opportunity to dynamically customize and price goods in ways that benefit both sellers and buyers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The shipping fee f S m I is established based on</figDesc></figure>
