<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The number of patients who have requested that their physicians prescribe a pharmaceutical drug by brand name has steadily increased, both in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calabro 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, IMS Health 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, Medical Marketing and Media 2002</ref> and abroad <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Weiss et al. 1996)</ref>.

Drug requests by brand name are commonly believed to have a positive effect on the number of prescriptions for the requested brand. Previous research has demonstrated such positive effects mostly using surveys among physicians, physician focus groups, and limited-scale experimentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aikin et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kravitz et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kravitz et al. , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mintzes et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Paterniti et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tentler et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Venkataraman and Stremersch (2007)</ref> quantitatively estimate the positive effect of drug requests on prescriptions by analyzing behavioral data from more than 2,000 physicians across the United States.</p><p>Because of the positive effect drug requests may have on prescriptions, there exists great debate on the extent to which patient requests for drugs by brand name are triggered by direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) by pharmaceutical manufacturers, whose spending amounted to $4.3 billion in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(AdAge 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Prior studies hotly contest DTCA's effect on prescriptions, with some studies claiming that DTCA spending has a large effect on prescriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atherly and Rubin 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Bell et al. 1999a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Fischer and Albers 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Iizuka and Jin 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Koch-Laking et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Kolsarici and Vakratsas 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Ling et al. 2002</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Zuvekas 2008</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wilkes et al. 2000)</ref>, yet others claim it has no effect, or a very limited one, on brand prescriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calabro 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Calfee et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Donohue and Berndt 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Manchanda et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">, Rosenthal et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">, Zachry et al. 2002</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kremer et al. (2008)</ref>, in a large metaanalysis examining the effectiveness of pharmaceutical promotional expenditures, even find that DTCA has a negative effect on prescriptions in the fields of skin disease, neurology, and psychiatry.</p><p>Most studies investigating the effect of DTCA on prescriptions forgo the study of drug requests as a mediator, although such mediation is often implied <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stremersch and Van Dyck 2009)</ref>. Some of these studies have focused on other possible mechanisms, aside from patient requests, that might influence the effect of DTCA on prescriptions. One mechanism, suggested by several studies, is through overall category size. These studies focus on the "market expanding" effect of DTCA and its role as a trigger for physician visits that do not affect the choice of a specific brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aikin et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Brekke and Kuhn 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Cantor 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Hosken and Wendling 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Liu and Gupta 2011</ref>. Another suggested mechanism for the effect of DTCA on prescriptions is through patients' price sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amaldoss and</ref><ref type="bibr">He 2009, Meyerhoefer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zuvekas 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amaldoss and He (2009)</ref>, for instance, suggest that DTCA for branded drugs can help pharmaceutical companies build goodwill among consumers that decreases their price sensitivity, leading to higher profits for these companies. Finally, increased patient compliance with the treatment regime was also investigated as a possible mediator through which DTCA can affect prescriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Wosinska 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Studies that focus on the extent to which patient requests by brand name are triggered by DTCA are rare and inconclusive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mintzes et al. (2003)</ref> find, using a patient survey, a higher request rate among respondents in Sacramento than among respondents in Vancouver, a difference the researchers attributed to higher DTCA exposure (despite an 87% cross-border exposure rate in Vancouver). <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Liu and Gupta (2011)</ref> find a positive effect of DTCA on the number of doctor visits in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports that 4% of patients visit their physicians with the primary purpose of asking about an advertised drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aikin et al. 2004)</ref>. Drug requests may also be triggered by sources other than DTCA, such as the information available in the media or on the Internet and word of mouth among patients and between patients and their friends, colleagues, or families <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Macias and Lewis 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Mack 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, McKillen 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Rama and Singh 2010</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Parnes et al.

(1996)</ref> observe an increase in drug requests even in countries that do not allow DTCA.</p><p>Physicians also show high heterogeneity in request accommodation behavior, which is left unexplained by prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Venkataraman and Stremersch 2007)</ref>. One explanatory factor may lie in physician specialty, because joint decision making between patients and specialists is less common than joint decision making between patients and general practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ding and Eliashberg 2008)</ref>. Other explanatory factors may be patient sociodemographic characteristics, because of their possible association with the variation in physicians' empathy and tolerance for participatory behavior of patients. For instance, physicians have been shown to be more dominant and less participatory when dealing with older or black patients than when dealing with younger or white patients (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cooper-Patrick et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Kaplan et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Street and Buller 1988</ref>.

First, this paper is the first to introduce a model that examines the full chain linking DTCA, drug requests by brand name, and prescriptions. Second, it is the first to uncover regional variation across the United States over the elements of the chain. This regional variation is, in turn, explained by the regions' sociodemographic characteristics, and more specifically the race/origin composition of the region population, after controlling for income, education, age, gender, and urbanization. Third, this paper uncovers differences between specialists and primary care physicians in elements of the DTCArequests-prescriptions chain. These contributions lead to unique and novel insights that are of relevance to companies and public policy makers.</p><p>We have combined three different databases for this study. The first database contains the number of prescriptions, the number of drug requests, and the number of detailing visits for branded drugs in the statin category for a panel of U.S. physicians, including the zip code in which each practice is located. The second database contains monthly national and local DTCA expenditures for each investigated brand at the designated market area (DMA) level. The third database, from the U.S. Census, contains the sociodemographic characteristics of the five-digit U.S. zip codes. The integrated database contains 142,180 prescriptions for 91 2,294 physicians over a period of 14 months, spanning 1,854 zip codes in 193 DMAs. In addition to these three data sets, we have also obtained and visually inspected all ads (TV and magazine) for the analyzed brands in the investigated time period, as provided to us by Kantar Media.</p><p>We specify a system of four equations, at the physician-brand-time level, which we estimate simultaneously. The four equations explain (1) the monthly number of prescriptions a physician writes, (2) the monthly number of drug requests a physician receives from patients, (3) the monthly number of detailing visits a physician receives from the manufacturer of each drug, and (4) the DTCA spending on each drug in the DMA the physician is located in. This system accounts for the endogeneity of patient requests, detailing, and DTCA. As in our data the only variation across physicians in DTCA levels is the local DTCA expenditures, we model endogeneity in local DTCA alone.</p><p>To uncover spatial variation, in terms of sociodemographics, and variation across primary care physicians and specialists, we employ a hierarchical specification for the physician-level model parameters. In addition, using a simulated patient-physicianlevel data set, we show that this model can recover patient-level effects, despite being estimated on physician-level and DMA-level data. We demonstrate the robustness of our main findings regarding the regional variation, in terms of sociodemographics, by carrying out a survey of 6,635 U.S. patients dispersed across the United States.</p><p>The findings from our study that are new to the literature are as follows. First, we document and identify sources of the large heterogeneity we find in the influence of DTCA, both on requests and prescriptions. For instance, we find that DTCA is less important as a driver of drug requests in areas with a higher proportion of minorities (blacks and Hispanics). Overall, we find that although there are areas, characterized by a specific sociodemographic makeup, in which higher spending on DTCA translates into more drug requests by brand name, this is not the case in the average DMA; the mean effect of DTCA on requests is very small and is negative. We also find that drug requests, especially to primary care physicians and, to a lesser extent, to specialists, have a significant influence on brand prescriptions and that the heterogeneity in physicians' tendency to accommodate requests can again be explained by sociodemographic variation across regions. Our most controversial finding is that drug requests by brand name in regions with higher percentages of blacks and Hispanics translate into fewer prescriptions of that brand than in regions with lower percentages of blacks and Hispanics (i.e., regions with higher percentages of whites). In the long run and on average, each drug request by brand name that a physician receives leads that physician to write 1.69 prescriptions for the requested drug.</p><p>As for control variables, in line with previous studies, we find a positive effect of detailing visits on prescriptions. The average long-run effect of a detailing visit is 0.85 prescriptions. As a detailing visit typically covers three brands, we assume a cost per detailing visit at the brand level to be equal to $50 and subsequently obtain an average return on investment (ROI) of detailing equal to 1.51 (i.e., each $1 cost of detailing at the brand level generates $1.51 in prescriptions at the brand level). The main determinants of local DTCA spending are the number of households owning a television set and the level of competitive spending.</p><p>Our findings cast doubt over the extent to which pharmaceutical firms can trigger patient drug requests with DTCA as it was implemented by the specific manufacturers included in our study. More recently, communication practices of firms have started shifting to unbranded drug ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Mundy 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">, Wang 2008</ref>. Such ads may relieve the negative effects of mentioning the side effects of a drug, a practice mandated by the FDA if the drug name is mentioned that may hinder information processing by consumers. In the future, firms are likely to increasingly shift also to digital and social media, which may prove to be more effective in triggering drug requests by brand name in specific sociodemographic classes. Given the much stronger effect of a drug request on prescriptions compared with the effect of a detailing visit (long-run effect of 1.69 versus 0.85, respectively), pharmaceutical firms are likely to continue to develop ways of reaching patients. Toward this effort, our model and results suggest that firms should adopt targeting policies that exploit the spatial patterns according to the sociodemographic profile we find in both drug request responsiveness to DTCA and physician prescription responsiveness to patient drug requests.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §2, we present the data used for the estimation of our model. We then develop our model and describe our estimation procedure in §3. In §4, we present the estimation results and a robustness analysis for our findings. We then summarize the implications of our findings for managers and policy makers in §5. In §6, we discuss future research opportunities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>We study the statin category in the United States from June 2002 to July 2003, a period during which the category consisted only of relatively mature drugs. We integrate three data sets for our empirical analysis, covering 142,180 prescriptions for 2,294 physicians over a 14-month period, spanning 1,854 zip codes in 193 DMAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>92</head><p>Marketing Science 32(1), pp. <ref type="bibr">89-110, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> The first data set includes physician-level (subscript p) panel data that contain monthly (subscript t), brand-specific (subscript j) information on the total number of prescriptions written (Rx pjt , the total number of patient drug requests 1 (Req pjt , and the total number of detailing visits (Det pjt . This information is recorded via a personal digital assistant after each interaction with a patient or a sales representative for a given brand and is therefore unlikely to show underreporting (e.g., because of lack of salience in memory of such interactions). Although we cannot reveal the data provider, many global pharmaceutical companies contract with it as a main provider for physician-level data.</p><p>The data also contain the five-digit zip code of each physician's practice and indicate whether the physician is a primary care physician (PCP) or a specialist. For our empirical analysis, we calibrate the model on physician-level data for the three most prescribed brands, which cumulatively account for 73% of the category volume. Doing this allows us to reduce the computational complexity and resources needed for our estimation without sacrificing the generalizability of our findings. In §4.4, we relax this constraint and estimate our model on the five largest brands.</p><p>The second data set contains monthly national and local DTCA expenditures for each brand in the category in the DMA in which each physician's practice is located. Obtained from Kantar Media, this variable is denoted as DTCA pjt . DMAs are large, and each one contains slightly more than 200 zip codes on average. Thus, we may assume that people live in the same areas as the physician they visit practices. On average, over the investigated time frame, the local DTCA expenditures for the three analyzed brands account for 6.4% of the national DTCA expenditures for these brands. The mean monthly local DTCA expenditures for a given DMA in our sample are $5,077. The variation of monthly local DTCA expenditures across DMAs (for the entire time period) is larger than the variation of monthly local DTCA expenditures across months (for all DMAs) (SD of $15,228 versus $7,306 for the mean monthly expenditures across DMAs and months, respectively).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> displays the evolution of DTCA spending (dashed lines) and the mean number of requests (solid lines) for each of the three brands we analyze over the observation period. We find that in our investigated time frame, the mean number of requests is relatively stable, whereas DTCA spending <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The total number of prescriptions includes both new prescriptions and refills. We report a model with new prescriptions only, as our data identify both separately. The total number of requests includes both requests to start therapy of a drug by brand name and requests to continue therapy of a brand name drug. Our data do not identify both separately, so we cannot run separate models. Other Magazines/newspapers TV is comparatively volatile. In addition, the pattern across brands in DTCA spending does not seem to visually match the pattern across brands in the number of drug requests.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> displays the distribution of DTCA spending across different media channels for the three brands we focus on. Brands A and C divide their DTCA expenditures between television and magazines/newspapers; Brand B spends almost exclusively on magazine/newspaper advertising.</p><p>The third data set contains the 2000 U.S. Census data on the following demographic characteristics of all U.S. zip codes, which we aggregated to the DMA level by calculating a weighted (according to the population size of the zip code) average.</p><p>• Race/origin: 2 This is the racial and ethnic mix of the population in the DMA of the physician, as operationalized by three variables: PerBlack p (percentage of population that is Black), PerHisp p (percentage  a Mean prescriptions, mean drug requests, and mean detailing are monthly means of the number of prescriptions, number of drug requests by brand name, and the number of detailing visits for the three brands across time for each physician, respectively.

The parameter 0pj represents a physician-brand-specific intercept for the number of drug requests, which we specify in a hierarchical manner.

Accordingly, we model both detailing and DTCA as nonrandom variables. The detailing equation is specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ln Det pjt = 0pj + 1p ln Rx pjt−1 + 1 + 2p ln CompDet pjt−1 + 1 + 3p ln Det pjt−1 + 1 + Det pjt (9)</formula><p>We allow pharmaceutical companies to set the number of detailing visits according to the number of prescriptions written by the physician for the brand in the previous period (captured by 1p , the competitive details the physician received in the previous period, (CompDet pjt−1 , captured by 2p , and the physician's responsiveness to detailing ( 2p , captured by 01 , in the specification of the parameter 0pj in Equation ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Manchanda et al. 2005</ref>).

We expect that pharmaceutical companies set the DTCA spending in a physician's region as a function of the volume of written prescriptions in the previous period, the DTCA spending of competitors in the previous period (CompDTCA pjt−1 ), and the inertia in DTCA spending. We further specify the base level of DTCA spending in a given physician's region as a function of responsiveness of requests to DTCA ( 1p , the responsiveness of prescriptions to requests ( 1p , the responsiveness of prescriptions to DTCA ( 3p , and the number of households in the region with a television set (HH_TV p ).</p><p>Note, again, that to account for potential endogeneity in DTCA spending, we included nonmarketing response drivers in Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and (12).

Failure to account for these factors leads to an endogeneity problem (Villas-Boas and Winer 1999). To overcome this problem, we incorporate brand-specific periodic demand shocks to all equations through brand-specific time-varying factors via the stochastic <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Endogeneity in advertising in our data is at the local DMA level. Therefore all DTCA variables in Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) are specified at the local DTCA level. For brevity we do not add local subscripts to these variables. .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Estimation</head><p>All four equations are estimated simultaneously as a system. In addition to correlated error terms across the four equations, there are four elements connecting the equations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Accounting for Endogeneity</head><p>Extant research has repeatedly demonstrated that the failure to properly account for unmeasured brand characteristics (UBCs) that affect consumer choices as well as firms' decisions (because of their influence on choices and hence on demand) results in two main outcomes. The first possible outcome is an endogeneity bias, which yields erroneous estimates of the mean effect of marketing-mix variables <ref type="bibr">(Berry 1994, Villas-Boas and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Winer 1999)</ref>. The second outcome is overstated variances in the estimated preference heterogeneity distribution and marketing-mix sensitivities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chintagunta et al. 2005</ref>). These two concerns hold while estimating demand models with both aggregate and individual-level panel data (like the one used in the current study).</p><p>Several alternatives have been proposed to address the aforementioned UBC problems. The first alternative (alternative 1) is a full-information approach to calibrate a structural demand model with or without a supply-side model. Studies in this stream usually rely on aggregate data and follow a <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Berry et al. (1995)</ref>-style generalized method of moments estimation framework. When a supply side is specified, the demand-and supply-side models are separately estimated, and the UBCs and supply-side unobservables are assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of exogenous instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Nevo 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">, Sudhir 2001</ref>. By separately estimating the demand-and supply-side models, supply-side misspecification does not impact the inference of the demand model. One also does not need to make any distributional assumptions on UBCs or supply-side cost shocks. These advantages come with some risk. Specifically, this approach cannot accommodate correlations between UBCs and supply-side cost shocks. The approach is also predicated on being able to obtain good-quality instrumental variables.</p><p>The second alternative (alternative 2) is to formally model the joint distribution of the endogenous marketing-mix elements and demand-side choices using maximum likelihood (ML) methods while accounting for the correlation between UBCs and supply-side cost shocks. A key advantage of the ML approach is that one can easily integrate out the UBCs and supply-side cost shocks and work with the unconditioned joint likelihood. The approach negates the need to have instrumental variables. Studies that pursue ML methods, however, differ in the way the supply side is modeled. Some studies in this stream, like alternative 1, undertake a full-information approach, where the data-generating process for the endogenous supply-side variables is modeled structurally as the equilibrium outcome of a game played between competing firms (Villas-Boas and Zhao 2005). A key advantage of the full-information approach is that by recovering the structural parameters of the demand and supply side, the researcher can use the recovered parameter estimates to conduct policy-relevant counterfactuals. However, these advantages come at a risk. For example, misspecification in the mechanism that generates the correlation between the modeled supply-side marketing-mix elements and the UBCs results in biased and inconsistent estimates not only of the parameters in the supply-side variables but, more importantly, of the demand parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Dubé and Chintagunta 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Bajari 2003</ref>. Furthermore, the full-information approach is subject to the risk of multiple equilibria <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berry 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the third alternative (alternative 3), as in alternative 2, the researcher models the joint distribution of the endogenous marketing-mix elements and demand-side choices using ML methods. Unlike alternative 2, the researcher here uses a limited-information approach, wherein the supply-side marketing elements are modeled in a reduced form. Like alternative 2, correlation between UBCs and supply-side cost shocks are readily accommodated. This is the approach undertaken in the current study. The key advantage of the limited-information approach in the current context is that one does not have to make any assumptions on the nature of conduct between firms or assume that the observed actions are equilibrium outcomes. This does away with the key limitation of the full-information approach of alternative 2. Here, the supply side is modeled as either linear or nonlinear (as in the current study) functions of variables that are uncorrelated with the UBCs and the stochastic components that correlated with the UBCs. The researcher then specifies a joint distribution of the UBCs and supply-side random components, along with the distribution assumption for consumer heterogeneity (Villas-Boas and Winer 1999, Draganska and Jain 2002). However, because the endogenous supply-side elements enter the demand model nonlinearly, one needs to use a transformation of variables to derive the joint likelihood, which now includes a Jacobian term in it. Conducting high-dimensional integration of such a complicated likelihood function can be very challenging and present the single biggest computational bottleneck.  propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters of the joint likelihood in alternative 2-style models. The study leverages MCMC methods that are at the heart of the Bayesian inference procedures and tailor made to compute very high-dimensional integrals. In the Bayesian framework, a high-dimension integration boils down to drawing random numbers from standard distributions and evaluating parametric density functions. The computational advantages of the Bayesian approach allow researchers to calibrate demand models with very flexible forms of heterogeneity while they are still computationally tractable. Like the classical counterpart, here too the researcher needs to make distributional assumptions on the correlation between UBCs and supply-side cost shocks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. (2005)</ref> introduce the hierarchical Bayesian approach to alternative 3-style models while accounting for nonrandomness in the marketing-mix elements. The estimation approach undertaken in the current study is an extension of the approach outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. (2005)</ref>. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. (2005)</ref> study jointly models the physician-specific prescription and detailing models; the current study jointly models physician-specific prescription, detailing, patient-requests, and DTCA equations, while allowing for nonrandomness in detailing, patient requests, and DTCA.</p></div>

The Brooks and Gelman diagnostic measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brooks and Gelman 1998)</ref>, over our 115 parameters, is very close to 1, with an average of 1.01, a minimum value of 0.99, and a maximum value of 1.15 (only two parameters had a value between 1.1 and 1.15, and only one parameter had a value between 0.990 and 0.995). Graphs of parameter estimates across model iterations show satisfactory convergence for all parameters and are available from the authors upon request.</p><p>Our model performs well compared with nested benchmark models.

Second, our model outperforms a system of (three) equations that excludes detailing, both as a variable in the prescriptions equation and as a separate equation in the system (out-ofsample RMSPE for prescriptions of 1.57 (full model) versus 1.59 (benchmark model 2)). Third, our model performs similarly to a system of (three) equations that excludes DTCA, both in the requests and prescriptions equations and as a separate equation in the system. This lack of fit improvement following the inclusion of DTCA further shows that in the observation period, DTCA did not play a large role in requests or prescriptions in this category. Fourth, our model outperforms a model with homogeneous parameters across physicians (out-of-sample RMSPE for prescriptions of 1.57 (full model) versus 1.70 (benchmark model 4)). Fifth, we also compare our model with a model that does not have a second layer but has random coefficients and find that both models show a similar out-of-sample fit, as one would expect. This outcome eases concerns of overfitting, as no additional variance is explained by a model with random coefficients. The estimates of the five nested models are similar-both in sign and in significance level-to the estimates of our full model and can be obtained from the authors upon request.</p></div>

Bold numbers for the posterior population mean indicate that zero lies outside the 95% highest posterior density interval of the population mean . <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The fifth column shows the population standard deviation of each parameter (i.e., the standard deviation of the physician-specific parameters).

The posterior probability refers to the likelihood that the parameter, drawn for our population of physicians, is greater than zero (if the posterior distribution mean is positive) or less than zero (if the posterior distribution mean is negative). Thus, a parameter with a positive population mean and a posterior probability <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We calculate the probability that zero lies outside the 95% highest posterior density interval of the distribution mean.

A parameter with a negative population mean and a posterior probability of 98% reflects a distribution where for 98% of the distribution, the sign for the parameter is below zero. 4.2.1. DTCA-Requests-Prescriptions. The mean of the distribution for the main effect of DTCA on drug requests is negative ( 1p = −0 29, SD = 0 07), but this effect shows great heterogeneity across physicians (population SD of 0.72). In 66% of our posterior sample draws, DTCA has a negative effect on the number of drug requests by brand name, whereas in 34% of our posterior sample draws, DTCA has a positive effect on the number of drug requests by brand name. Looking at the posterior draws for each individual physician, we find that for only 7% of our population of physicians, zero is outside the 90% posterior interval, with 6% having negative draws and just 1% having positive draws. This finding fits the mixed evidence on the extent to which DTCA triggers drug requests by brand name (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Calabro 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Parnes et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">, Weiss et al. 1996</ref> and, more generally, on the effect of DTCA on prescriptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kremer et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The carryover effect of DTCA, both directly in the prescription equation and indirectly in the request equation, and the (main) direct effect of DTCA on the number of prescriptions are negligible ( 2p = −0 01 SD = 0 05 3p = 0 0003 SD = 0 01 4p = 0 01 SD = 0 01). Thus, additional DTCA spending does not have a positive effect on a physician's tendency to prescribe the advertised drug, nor does it have a significant carryover effect in future time periods. This finding fits the descriptive pattern in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, in which, visually, the pattern across brands in DTCA spending does not match the pattern across brands in the number of drug requests.</p><p>There may be several reasons why we, in this category in this time window, do not find a large and positive effect of DTCA (as in Fischer and Albers 2010, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ling et al. 2002</ref>) but instead find small or even negative effects (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Calfee et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Calabro 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Donohue and Berndt 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Manchanda et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">, Rosenthal et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">, Zachry et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kremer et al. 2008</ref>.</p><p>First, all the brands we analyzed, although still heavily advertised <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atherly and Rubin 2009)</ref>, are mature brands. Previous research has shown that advertising elasticities decrease as markets mature <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kolsarici and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vakratsas 2010, Vakratsas and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Ambler 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Second, in our observation window, branded drug advertisements are more common than unbranded drug advertisements. Branded drug advertisements typically contain a laundry list of side effects from the manufacturer, mandated by the FDA, which may intimidate patients, blocking them from cognitively processing the ad, and may outweigh the benefits of treatment the ad mentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kolsarici and</ref><ref type="bibr">Vakratsas 2010, Wang 2008</ref>). An average of 18 seconds across all one-minute TV commercials in our sample was spent on mentioning possible risks, such as warnings against drug use for patients with liver disease, pregnant women, women who might become pregnant, nursing women, patients taking other medication, etc. In addition, all commercials caution against serious side effects caused by drug use and indicate weakness and muscle pain as possible warning signals. Thus, the ads in this period may have effectively scared patients rather than attracted them to make brandspecific drug requests.</p><p>Third, local DTCA in the investigated time frame for the respective brands is only about 6% of the national DTCA expenditures for those brands, causing little variance in DTCA exposure across DMAs. It is conceivable that categories and time frames with higher levels of local DTCA may also show different DTCA effects.</p><p>We find that drug requests have a positive effect on the number of prescriptions ( 1p = 1 10, SD = 0 06). The long-run impact of drug requests is accounted for through the inclusion of lagged prescriptions in the prescription equation. As the exact expressions for the cumulative or long-term effect of an additional request do not exist in closed form, we follow the approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. (2005)</ref> and provide a local approximation for this derivative for each physician. This is given by 1p longrun = 1p / 1 − 8p , which for most physicians is positive. We report the distribution of the long-run request effect as a histogram in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>On average, the long-run effect of drug requests on the number of prescriptions is 1.69. That is, an additional drug request by brand name increases the long-run expected number of prescriptions for that same brand by almost two. Studies in medicine and social science have suggested several possible explanations for a positive influence of drug requests on the number of prescriptions. First, physicians may accommodate requests to increase patient satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kravitz et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">, Uhlmann et al. 1988</ref> and to signal that they care about the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Prosser et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Schwartz et al. 1989</ref>. Second, physicians might fear that refusing a request compromises the trusting relationship with their patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berger et al. 2001)</ref> and may even lead to patient defection <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Stevenson et al. 2000)</ref>. A third possible reason for request accommodation is that physicians lack the time to change patients' minds and try to avoid conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Prosser et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Schwartz et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Stevenson et al. 2000</ref>. Finally, studies have suggested that physicians   Frequency accommodate requests in the hope that prescribing a requested drug makes the patient more compliant <ref type="bibr">(Uhlmann et al. 1988, Webb and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Lloyd 1994)</ref>.</p></div>

This effect size is similar to what has been found in prior studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kremer et al. 2008)</ref>. We calculated the ROI for a detailing visit (based on data obtained from IMS Health and Consumer Reports) 8 on the periodic revenue per prescription for the brand. We assess a detailing visit cost to be $150, based on data from Quintiles, the largest provider of pharmaceutical sales services. Given that each detailing visit typically covers three brands, we take $50 as the cost of a detailing visit per brand. We found that the ROI of a detailing visit is 1.51, which means that a $1 detailing increase leads to a $1.51 increase in prescription revenue.</p><p>Competitive prescriptions have a positive effect on the number of prescriptions ( 5p = 0 78 SD = 0 02), likely because of category growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mizik and Jacobson 2004)</ref>. Competitive requests, in contrast, do not have a significant effect on the number of prescriptions ( 6p = 0 01 SD = 0 03). Likewise, lagged mean prescriptions in the DMA do not have an effect on the number of prescriptions ( 7p = 0 02 SD = 0 02).</p><p>Lagged prescriptions at the physician level have a positive effect on the number of prescriptions ( 8p = 0 27 SD = 0 01), which may be because of within-practice word of mouth or prescription inertia <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Coscelli 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Janakiraman et al. 2008</ref>.</p><p>The estimates of the drug request equation show a higher base request level for Brand A ( 0p1 = −5 82) than for Brand C ( 0p3 = −6 66) or for Brand B ( 0p2 = −7 87). Lagged prescriptions have a negative effect on the number of requests ( 3p = −0 33 SD = 0 04). This effect may comprise word-of-mouth effects among patients, which are typically positive, but it may also comprise visit persistence by the same patient. As a prescription typically covers a treatment period of three months, few patients who received a prescription in a given month would return the following month to make a request, causing this effect to turn negative.</p><p>The estimates of the detailing equation show that Brands A and C have the highest numbers of detailing visits ( 0p1 = −2 15; 0p3 = −2 15), followed by Brand B ( 0p2 = −3 59), consistent with observed detailing shares. Physicians who prescribe more ( 1p = 0 57 SD = 0 03) or receive more detailing visits from competitors ( 2p = 0 36 SD = 0 02) receive more sales calls.

Lagged prescriptions have no significant effect on DTCA spending ( 1p = −0 15 SD = 0 14), which fits the volatility in month-to-month spending that we observed in the raw data (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Lagged competitive spending has a positive effect on DTCA spending ( 2p = 0 29 SD = 0 07),  showing that firms tend to run campaigns after competitors have done so. Finally, DTCA shows substantial inertia ( 3p = 1 40 SD = 0 04).</p></div>

From Requests to Prescriptions: Specialty and Spatial Variation. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>(a), our main interest lies in parameters 11 -18 (rows 5-7). We find that drug requests to specialists translate into fewer prescriptions than drug requests to primary care physicians ( 11 = −0 78 SD = 0 15). Specialists have greater intellectual mastery over their specialties than do primary care physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kravitz et al. 2003)</ref>, which may enable them to convince patients more easily that the requested drug is not their drug of choice.</p><p>As for spatial variation, we find that drug requests in DMAs with higher proportions of minoritiesnotably blacks ( 12 = −0 99 SD = 0 59) and Hispanics ( 13 = −1 72 SD = 0 52)-translate into fewer prescriptions, compared with DMAs with lower proportions of minorities. A likely reason is that the medical interview is less participatory for minorities than it is for whites. Minority patients have been found to be less assertive in physician-patient interactions and more respectful of the physician-patient hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Street et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Tamayo-Sarver et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">, Young and Klingle 1996</ref> and are thus probably less persistent in pursuing the prescription of their requested drugs. Minorities were also found to have a lower evaluation of physicians when it came to communication that involved patient input and empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hooper et al. 1982)</ref>. Blacks were found to rate their visits with physicians as less participatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cooper-Patrick et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Kaplan et al. 1995</ref>. We were also able to rule out the following alternative explanations.</p><p>As we control for education, it is unlikely that the effect is caused by difficulties of minorities to express themselves with physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Helman 1994)</ref>. Moreover, the coefficient for income and education shows that requests are accommodated less frequently in highincome, high-education DMAs, not more frequently ( 15 = −0 34 SD = 0 08).</p><p>A second alternative explanation we ruled out is that minorities may have different cardiovascular conditions. Blacks have higher heart disease-related mortality rates than whites do, but Hispanics typically have lower mortality rates from heart disease than whites (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010). Thus, the cardiovascular condition cannot explain the similar lower request effects on prescriptions for both areas with higher percentages of blacks and areas with higher percentages of Hispanics.</p><p>A third alternative explanation we ruled out is that DMAs with higher proportions of whites may contain more physicians than DMAs with higher proportions of minorities. A higher number of physicians may lead physicians to accommodate drug requests more easily because of increased competition between physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bell et al. 1999b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Kravitz 2000</ref>. However, we found no significant correlation between the number of physicians per capita and the minority composition of a region, whether defined according to zip code or DMA. Also, when we control for the number of physicians in the DMA, the model's coefficients remain robust.</p><p>Beyond the minority composition of the DMA, we found that the age distribution of a DMA may also be a source of regional variation in request accommodation. Drug requests by brand name are less likely to translate into prescriptions in DMAs that have higher proportions of people over 40 ( 16 = −4 67 SD = 2 27). Older patients may suffer more from drug interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Donohue and Berndt 2004)</ref> or side effects (e.g., myopathy is a common side effect of statins among the elderly; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Daugird and Crowell 2003)</ref>. In addition, physicians are typically more communicatively dominant with patients over 40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Street and Buller 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we find that the gender distribution of a DMA does not explain spatial variation in request accommodation and that urban DMAs exhibit significantly higher request accommodation rates than do rural DMAs ( 18 = 2 22 SD = 0 60). Traditional norms and values persist for a longer time in rural areas than in urban areas. Thus, one may expect patients and physicians in rural areas to preserve the traditional physician-patient hierarchy more than is the case in urban areas, leading to lower influence of the patient on the physician (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Deveugele et al. 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>(a), columns 9 and 10, show the estimation results of the second-level parameters for responsiveness to detailing, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>(a), columns 12 and 13, show the estimation results of the second-level parameters for responsiveness to DTCA, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.2.</head><p>From DTCA to Requests: Specialty and Spatial Variation. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>(b), our main interest lies in the parameters 10 -18 (rows 5-7). We find that although specialists receive more drug requests ( 02 = 1 14 SD = 0 37), these drug requests are not disproportionally triggered by DTCA compared with those to primary care physicians ( 11 = −0 03 SD = 0 16). Patients who see a specialist typically have more severe medical conditions than patients who see a primary care physician and may therefore be more involved and informed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gould 1988</ref>) and thus more likely to make a request. Apparently, the increased involvement and information does not come from DTCA but may come from alternative sources, such as word of mouth, online searches, and discussions with the primary care physician before referral, which we were unable to cover in the present study. As for regional variation, we find that the number of drug requests triggered by DTCA is lower in DMAs with higher proportions of blacks and Hispanics than in DMAs with lower proportions of blacks and Hispanics ( 12 = −2 78 SD = 0 45; 13 = −1 74 SD = 0 49), even though the former DMAs show a higher number of drug requests by brand name ( 03 = 6 10 SD = 1 17; 04 = 5 89 SD = 1 03). This fits with earlier findings that among all ethnic groups, Hispanics show the lowest effect of drug advertising on check-up visits <ref type="bibr">(Cantor 2010, Hosken and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wendling 2010)</ref>. A visual inspection of the ads for the three investigated brands over the analyzed time period reveals that the vast majority of models participating in these ads are white. This finding fits with prior research that has also shown that blacks and Hispanics are highly underrepresented in drug advertisements; studies of magazine advertisements for heart disease medication did not find such ads in any magazines targeting the black population, and a vast majority (over 90%) of the models across all investigated ads were white <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mastin et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Omonuwa 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">, Welch Cline and Young 2004</ref>. Social identity theory would imply that blacks and Hispanics may give less attention to such advertisements, leading to lower DTCA effectiveness in generating drug requests among blacks and Hispanics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barg and Greir (2008)</ref> suggest that marketing efforts that are based on a "mass appeal" may contribute to disparities in preventive health behaviors. Research in the domain of preventive care for breast cancer argues that because marketing communications in this domain are concentrated around women who are white, straight, middle to upper class, urban, educated, and professional <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cartwright 1998)</ref>, they have low appeal and elicit low levels of identification among lower-income black women.</p><p>Among the other sociodemographic variables, the income, education, age, and gender distribution and the level of urbanization of a DMA significantly moderate the effect of DTCA expenses on the number of requests. In DMAs with higher income and education levels, a higher percentage of people over 40, or a higher percentage of males, as well as in more rural DMAs, DTCA expenditures are less effective in triggering drug requests than in DMAs with lower income and education levels, a lower percentage of people over 40, and a lower percentage of males, as well as in urban DMAs ( 15 = −0 10 SD = 0 05; 16 = −5 20 SD = 1 61; 17 = −13 81 SD = 7 78; 18 = 1 16 SD = 0 46). Moreover, the relatively large number of more urban DMAs across the United States may also explain the high representation of negative values in the distribution of 1p (the effect of DTCA on number of requests).</p><p>We further compared physicians for whom we find a significant positive effect of DTCA on requests with physicians for whom we find a significant negative effect of DTCA on requests. 10 Consistent with our findings, we find that physicians associated with a positive effect of DTCA on requests practice in DMAs that are more urban (DMA urbanization levels of 80.9% versus 69% for physicians associated with positive and negative effects, respectively), have a lower percentage of blacks and Hispanics (mean percent blacks, 8.6 versus 25.6; mean percent Hispanics, 11.3 versus 12.0, for positive and negative effects, respectively), and have a lower percentage of population over the age of 40 (mean percent 40.4 versus 43.7, for positive and negative effects, respectively) than the DMAs of physicians associated with a negative effect.</p><p>In addition, we find that the responsiveness of physicians to requests is not a significant determinant of the number of requests ( 01 = −0 09 SD = 0 08).</p></div>

First, we find that the responsiveness of the physician to detailing visits has a negative effect on the base level of detailing for the physician ( 01 = −0 57 SD = 0 09). This finding is consistent with a similar finding in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>For DTCA spending, we find that although DTCA expenses are higher in DMAs where a greater number of households own a television set ( 04 = 1 20 SD = 0 08), they are not dependent on the responsiveness of prescriptions to DTCA ( 03 = 0 03 SD = 0 11), prescriptions to requests ( 02 = −0 02 SD = 0 04), or requests to DTCA ( 01 = −0 008 SD = 0 04).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Robustness</head><p>To assess the robustness 11 of our results, we first checked whether the insignificant effect of DTCA on physician prescriptions masks an interaction effect between DTCA and the number of drug requests a physician receives. We included this interaction term and found it not significant. Second, we reestimated our model including the fourth and the fifth most prescribed brands in the category as well (covering roughly 85% of the category). These brands are detailed much less than the three most prescribed brands and were not advertised during the investigated time frame. Our main estimation results remain the same.</p><p>Third, we also estimated our model with spatial variation at the zip code level, rather than at the DMA level, and find our main findings to hold. The only exception is the level of urbanization, for which the effects in the second layer of the model are the reverse of what we report above. Physician offices are often located in urban areas, which may cause the secondlayer effects of urbanization at the zip code level to deviate from those at the level of the DMA.</p><p>Fourth, our prescription variable includes the total number of prescriptions, as we cannot distinguish between requests for new drug prescriptions or refills (i.e., a request to continue treatment). We have estimated our model excluding refills. Our main findings hold.</p><p>Fifth, although we added 1 to the variables in our log-log transformation to avoid zeros, as is common (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Manchanda et al. 2005)</ref>, we also estimated the model with the addition of 2 instead of 1. The main results are similar to the results of our model reported above.</p><p>Sixth, because of a lack of direct, observational data at the patient level, the second layer of our model uses region-level sociodemographics as moderators, rather than patient-level moderators. Therefore, we also ran a dyadic, patient-physician-level simulation to demonstrate that the NBD model we estimate can recover patient-level effects. We find that the dyadic effects are reflected in the aggregate estimation results, as represented by our NBD model. We also find that if the simulation data include a significant effect of DTCA on requests at the individual level, our model at the aggregate level can indeed recover this effect. Although our study takes place in a different setting, the approach we undertake here can be viewed as bearing a strong resemblance to the approach outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Musalem et al. (2008)</ref>, who recover consumer-level coupon utilization using aggregate market-share and couponredemption volume alone. Moreover, because the patient-physician-level simulation exercise does not allow us to evaluate the estimation procedure's ability to recover the true parameters underlying the observed behavior, we also performed a simulation exercise in which we estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>) using data simulated with known parameters. We then evaluated whether the estimation recovers those parameters. The comparison of the estimated values and simulated values in this second simulation illustrates that our estimation procedure recovers the underlying parameters for the data. Both first-and second-layer parameters were found to be very similar to the values used to generate the data. Overall, the second simulation provides additional validation for our estimation procedure's ability to recover the true parameters underlying the observed behavior in our data (see Web Appendix B for details on both simulation exercises).</p><p>Seventh, there is a moderate negative correlation of −0.46 between the percentage of blacks in a DMA (PerBlack) and the percentage of males (PerMale) in the DMA. This value might be a result of the very low standard deviation of the PerMale variable in our sample (mean = 0 49, SD = 0 01). Although we cannot explain this moderate negative correlation, we reestimated our model excluding PerMale in all secondlevel equations to alleviate a multicolinearity concern that the −0 46 correlation lowers the PerBlack coefficient. The estimation results are very similar to those of the model that includes PerMale. More specifically, the significance, as well as the sign, of the estimated PerBlack effect is similar in both estimation runs. All other estimates of the second-level parameters are also very similar in sign and significance levels to those of the original estimation results. We therefore conclude that the −0.46 correlation between the percentage of PerBlack and PerMale does not affect our estimation result.</p><p>Eighth, to further empirically validate our secondlayer DMA-level findings at the dyadic level, we conducted a patient survey. We gathered data from 6,635 U.S. patients. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The first part of the survey, which was answered by all participants, contained questions regarding the effect of DTCA on request behavior among patients. The second part of the survey contained specific questions regarding patient requests and the patient-physician relationship. Respondents who indicated that they had never requested a drug by brand name either from their primary care physician or from a specialist did not participate in the second part of the survey. In our sample of patients, 67% reported having requested drugs by brand name. Using a completely different methodology (selfreports) than the NBD model on behavioral data, the survey lends support to our main second-layer findings. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">5</ref> reports the estimation results of an ordinal regression with the frequency of patient request accommodation as a dependent variable. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> As in our NBD model estimation results, patients report higher accommodation frequencies of primary care physicians than of specialists (est = 0 52 p &lt; 0 01). Again, as in our NBD model estimation results, we find that blacks (est = −0 27 p &lt; 0 01) and Hispanics (est = −0 32 p &lt; 0 01) report significantly lower accommodation frequencies than do whites. As in our NBD model estimation results, the age of the patient has a negative effect on request accommodation (est = −0 02 p ≤ 0 01). In contrast to our NBD model, the effect of a factor composed of income and education on request accommodation is positive (est = 0 15 p &lt; 0 01) rather than negative. We do not find a significant effect of the remaining demographics on request accommodation frequency.</p><p>We also examined whether blacks and Hispanics were less influenced by DTCA than whites, as reported on the basis of the NBD model in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3(</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b).</head><p>Respondents were asked whether they had ever talked to their physicians based on an advertisement for a prescription drug displayed on television or in a magazine. Of the total survey population, 30.2% answered "yes." Respondents who answered "yes" were then asked about the nature of the discussion. Consistent with our model estimation results, the percentage of blacks and Hispanics requesting a prescription for an advertised drug (23.6% for blacks and 26.7% for Hispanics) was lower than the percentage of whites requesting a prescription for an advertised drug (31.9%). For Asians, the corresponding percentage was 28.3%. These percentages are relatively large compared with our NBD results. This may suggest that the effect of DTCA on drug requests from our 2002-2003 statin sample is small compared with the effects one may find in other drug categories or a more recent time window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications for Managers and Policy Makers</head><p>In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive model that uncovers the DTCA-requests-prescriptions chain. It also uncovers variation along the entire chain, dependent on DMA (i.e., the sociodemographic makeup of the DMA) and physician specialty, leading to insights that are of interest to both managers and policy makers. Although many managers in pharmaceutical firms express high expectations as to the effectiveness of DTCA in increasing patient requests for their own brands, we show here that DTCA may not always deliver on these expectations. In our study of the statin category between 2002 and 2003, we find that the average effect of DTCA on patient requests is very small; i.e., it is negligible for 93% of physician practices, negative for 6% of the practices, and positive for only 1% of the practices. Thus, in our sample (i.e., category and time period), DTCA only has the expected positive effect on requests in 1% of practices. These practices are typically located in urban DMAs with a high proportion of young whites.</p><p>We can also graphically depict the spatial pattern we observed across DMAs in the responsiveness of drug requests to DTCA spending (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). Such a map can provide marketing managers with a better understanding of where DTCA spending leads to desired increases in drug requests by brand name. By extension, one can configure a similar map for physician prescription responsiveness to patient drug requests (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>). The combination of both would allow marketing managers to infer in which markets they could generate greater ROI from DTCA (as measured by increased prescriptions through increased requests). Furthermore, pharmaceutical firms could proactively reach out to areas with accommodating physicians. In the category and time frame of our study, we documented that firms only spend 6% of their national DTCA budget on local DTCA. The spatial patterns we find may require firms to shift more of their spending from national media to local media in highly responsive areas. Conjecturing beyond the boundaries of our study, manufacturers may also consider targeting different patient groups along their sociodemographic characteristics, using social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, or specialized platforms such as PatientsLikeMe), rather than mass advertising. Such highly targeted media strategies may allow higher sensitivity to minorities, who may display different networking behavior and show Overall, the effect of drug requests on prescriptions is large and positive, which may trigger public policy concerns. On the one hand, patient requests may potentially threaten the gatekeeping function of the physician if the physician prescribes drugs he would otherwise (i.e., without request) not prescribe. On the other hand, the participation of the patient may lead to more shared decision making between the patient and physician. In this case, however, policy makers may want to monitor whether the right to participate in medical decisions is equally distributed across sociodemographic groups. Based on actual request and prescription data and self-reported survey data, we inventory large differences in accommodation behavior across DMAs along sociodemographic characteristics such as DMA racial and ethnic composition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Future Research</head><p>First, given the type of data we have, we cannot ascertain whether the drug requested by a given patient is the optimal treatment for the patient. Hence, future research that can offer such normative claims would be highly relevant to public policy makers.</p><p>Second, the insurance coverage of the patient may affect physicians' propensity to accommodate drug requests. Our analysis involves insured patients (97% of our data portrays prescription behavior for insured patients), so the mere question of insurance coverage is not likely to affect our results. Moreover, the effect of insurance type may relate to the age variable and the factor score IncEdu_F. Still, it would be interesting if future research could reveal differential requesting and accommodation behavior across insurance types.</p><p>Third, we studied only one category-namely, statins. Although the statin category is the largest drug category in our data window, and although our survey results are non-malady specific, our study would benefit from replications in other categories.</p><p>Fourth, we used monthly data for prescriptions, requests, detailing, and DTCA. If researchers can obtain data with a higher periodicity (e.g., daily), it would allow for a richer model of the dynamics in these behaviors. In addition, because the insights we obtain are obviously bounded by the variance in our data, we cannot gauge the consequences of a policy shift in DTCA, e.g., the number of prescriptions a firm would lose were it to drop DTCA to zero.</p><p>Fifth, we do not have patient-level data, which limits our insights regarding the extent to which our findings are driven by a small number of patients repeatedly requesting drugs by brand name or a large number of patients requesting drugs by brand name infrequently. The survey we conducted indicates that a third of the population of patients above the age of 18 (33%) report having requested prescription drugs by brand name from a primary care physician multiple times (i.e., they request drugs by brand name "sometimes," "most of the time," or "all the time"). An additional 35.4% of the patients say that they have requested branded drugs but do so only rarely, and 32.2% respond that they have never requested a drug by brand name. This suggests that drug requests by brand name are common and that our results may be representative of a large population of patients requesting drugs by brand name.</p><p>Sixth, we do not observe drug sampling. Although one may conceive of sampling as a determinant of future request behavior, such a conception would not fit prior findings in the same category. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Venkataraman and Stremersch (2007)</ref>, in the same therapeutic category, have concluded that samples are given as a financial subsidy to prescriptions rather than being used as a trial after which patients request a prescription for the drug. Moreover, sampling may be heavily correlated with detailing, for which we control. Still, sampling is underresearched, and connecting it to requesting and request accommodation behavior may yield interesting insights.</p><p>Seventh, our model does not control for patients possibly selecting physicians based on the degree to which they accommodate requests. Our survey results show that this may not be a cause for great concern, as patients do not switch physicians often (the average relationship duration is 8 years); indeed, only a small minority (&lt; 10%) is likely to switch physicians when a drug request is denied. Also, from our NBD model, we find that physicians who accommodate requests more frequently do not necessarily receive more requests.</p><p>Eighth, as we cannot distinguish between requests for new drug treatment versus refills, we model total drug requests and total prescriptions. If future research could obtain data that distinguish between requests for new drug treatment, competing drug treatment (i.e., switch requests), or refills, one could assess the possibly differential effects of such requests. Several papers in the medical literature specifically discuss situations in which patients request to switch from a previously prescribed drug or to continue using their prescribed drug (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Prosser et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">, Uhlmann et al. 1988</ref>. Thus, drug requests to continue treatment may be as important to study as drug requests to start a new drug treatment. In addition, our outcome variable is the number of prescriptions rather than the number of doctor visits or other outcomes. We refer readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Liu and Gupta (2011)</ref> for a study on the effect of DTCA on doctor visits and visit outcomes.</p><p>Ninth, adding fixed effects for the DMA may further capture DMA-level variation beyond the lagged mean number of prescriptions written in the DMA (which is included in the model). However, this would entail adding 193 regional dummies to each of our four equations, which is cumbersome to estimate, given the complexity of our model specification. To evaluate whether DMA-specific effects explain a large share of the base prescriptions level, over and above the demographic characteristics of these DMAs, we regressed these dummies on the errors from the Marketing Science 32(1), pp. 89-110, © 2013 INFORMS second-level equation for base-level prescriptions (see Equation ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)). We find that 90% of the DMA dummies are insignificant in explaining these errors. We therefore conclude that the risk of having a systematic unobserved DMA effect that may bias our estimation results is low. For similar reasons, we allow for heterogeneity across physicians in all first-level parameters, yet model a second layer only for the covariates that are of focal interest to this study.</p><p>In general, there exist many opportunities for future research on the interaction between patients and physicians. Requesting a drug by brand name is but one action that patients take, besides making specialty requests and requests for diagnostics, all of which may affect the treatment decisions of the physician and the treatment compliance of the patient. Such consumerist actions, their effects for drug companies, and the concerns they generate among public policy makers should be of great interest to marketing scholars.</p></div>
