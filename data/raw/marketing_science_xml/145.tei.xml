<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Online advertisers often utilize multiple publishers to deliver ads to multihoming consumers. These ads often generate externalities and their exposure is uncertain, impacting advertising effectiveness across publishers. We analyze the inefficiencies created by externalities and uncertainty when information is symmetric between advertisers and publishers, in contrast to most previous research that assumes information asymmetry. Although these inefficiencies cannot be resolved through publisher-side actions, attribution methods that measure campaign uncertainty can serve as alternative solutions to help advertisers adjust their strategies. Attribution creates a virtual competition between publishers, resulting in a team compensation problem. The equilibrium may potentially increase the aggressiveness of advertiser bidding, leading to increased advertiser profits. The popular last-touch method is shown to overincentivize ad exposures, often resulting in lower advertiser profits. The Shapley value achieves an increase in profits compared with the lasttouch method. Popular publishers and those that appear early in the conversion funnel benefit the most from advertisers using last-touch attribution. The increase in advertiser profits comes at the expense of total publisher profits and often results in decreased ad allocation efficiency. We also find that the prices paid in the market will decrease when more sophisticated attribution methods are adopted.</p><p>History: Yuxin Chen served as the senior editor and Duncan Simester served as associate editor for this article.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Advertisers in online campaigns often choose to deliver ads using multiple publishers that reach overlapping target populations. The ads displayed on Google's and Facebook's websites, for example, cover more than 50% of the online advertising market in the United States. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> When consumers multihome and visit multiple publishers during these campaigns, the ads they see often have a cumulative effect that creates an externality between the effectiveness of ads across publishers.</p><p>Because the behavior of multihoming consumers is stochastic, when planning multipublisher campaigns, advertisers face uncertainty about the campaigns' performance. This uncertainty may be about the effectiveness of individual ad exposures, the reach the ads may have, or the effect from competition that targets the same customers. When buying these ads in an auction market, the advertiser needs to take these uncertainties into account and ex ante decide how to bid on ads, resulting in ad allocations and campaign performance that are less efficient than if the advertiser had complete information. These inefficiencies often result in severe degradation of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, leading to frustration from advertisers and questions about the effectiveness of online advertising.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, recently lowered their digital ad spending because they could not prove its effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bruell and Terlep 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on online advertising markets has focused primarily on the inefficiency of advertising campaigns created by advertising channel discoordination and asymmetric information. This prior research takes the viewpoint of platforms and publishers, focusing on the actions they can take in the market. A primary assumption is that by aggregating their information, publishers can gain superior information compared with advertisers and can exploit this advantage to coordinate the market and improve its efficiency. Examples include changing the pricing mechanisms in the market to create incentive compatibility <ref type="bibr">(Jordan et al. 2011, Johnson and</ref> and aggregating publishers into a network that can track and target individuals across different publishers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(D'Annunzio and Russo 2017)</ref>. These assumptions, however, can be limited in their applicability. One limitation is the fact that competing platforms such as Google and Facebook will be reluctant to share and coordinate information or may be forbidden to do so. A second limitation is that advertisers are left having to trust the publishers to tell them how effective their ads are in a market rife with moral hazard.</p><p>In this paper, we take the viewpoint of an advertiser and analyze the campaign inefficiency that arises when an advertiser buys ads on multiple publishers in a market with structural uncertainties. We call an uncertainty "structural" when the information is symmetric (i.e., all players have the same a priori knowledge about ad efficiency) and when the publishers cannot resolve it fully unless they change the market structure. Specifically, because consumer visits to websites are stochastic and because bids need to be submitted in advance and independently to each publisher, publishers are unable to discriminate between consumers who multihome and those who do not. Unless publishers collude and share information in real time or agree on a centralized pricing mechanism, they will be unable to exploit targeted pricing or allocation for multihoming consumers.</p><p>Unlike publishers, however, advertisers do have access to the complete information collected during a campaign, ex post. Because advertisers will not coordinate or cooperate with their competitors, their problem is viewed as a problem of measurement (of the uncertain state of the campaign) and optimization given this measurement. The assumption is that once proper measurement is in place, optimization of the advertising campaigns will improve the competitiveness of the advertisers, increase their profits, and make the market more efficient. Consequently, a common technique that advertisers use with these data is multitouch attribution, which is the focus of this paper. Multitouch attribution uses the information collected during the campaign to estimate the effectiveness of each publisher and the contribution of each ad exposure ("touch") to each consumer response. These estimates are then used to adjust the bids on different publishers, with a goal of optimizing the campaign.</p><p>Although multitouch attribution is commonly used to benchmark publisher performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Econsultancy 2012)</ref>, it is unclear what the value of the process is and how to best make use of the data. In a recent survey by <ref type="bibr">Econsultancy (2012, p. 13</ref>) and Google, 42% indicated that being "unsure of how to choose the appropriate method/model of attribution" is an impediment to adopting an attribution method. The most common method used by advertisers is called the "last-touch" (LT) method, in which the last touchpoint in a sequence of ads prior to conversion gets full credit for the conversion. Another recently popular method is using the Shapley value (Sh) to assign the average marginal contribution to conversion as the credit for each touchpoint. Because these methods are in essence measurement methods of the uncertain state of the campaign, the result of the measurement process will impact the bidding strategies of the attributing advertiser.</p><p>The first research question we address is to understand how structural uncertainties impact the profits and behavior of advertisers when they run multipublisher campaigns. Because externalities exist between publishers, the bidding strategies of advertisers, the equilibrium bids by competitors, and allocation of ads by publishers may be different from when running single-publisher campaigns. Our model assumes that information is symmetric in the market, unlike most other research, and assesses the impact of uncertainty when neither publishers nor advertisers have an informational advantage. Although a significant body of research looks to understand the influences of asymmetric information, risk preferences, and monitoring capabilities online <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agarwal et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Wilbur and Zhu 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Mayzlin et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Hu et al. 2015</ref>, we show that even without such asymmetries, the market will still suffer from inefficiency, and attribution may help as a tool. Because we assume that publishers cannot coordinate through a centralized mechanism, and given the impact of structural uncertainty, we focus on the potential of multitouch attribution to increase advertiser profits. Specifically, we ask under what circumstances an advertiser should expect a benefit from applying an attribution method, and what the impact may be for competing advertisers and publishers. Answering these questions helps to explain why advertisers may be unhappy with the effectiveness of their campaigns once they start engaging in multipublisher advertising. As our results show, engaging in a multipublisher campaign changes the allocation of profits between advertisers and publishers, which also helps to explain why many publishers support the efforts of advertisers to introduce attribution solutions.</p><p>The second question we tackle touches on the effectiveness of two popular attribution methods (last touch and the Shapley value) when an advertiser competes with other strategic advertisers. As we will discuss in Section 2, the majority of research on advertising attribution is empirical in nature and focuses on developing more accurate measurement methods. A common issue with this analysis, however, is the assumption that ad prices and competitor responses will not change when an advertiser gains more information. These methods are benchmarked in a vacuum, without taking into account how the market will respond to an advertiser who modifies her bidding strategy. Analytical work on the topic also assumes a single advertiser that attempts to optimize her campaigns, disregarding the effects and responses of publishers and other advertisers. Our analysis, in contrast, shows that the indirect equilibrium effects of applying an attribution method are substantial. For example, we find cases where using multitouch attribution results in lowered profits for advertisers because of the competitive positioning it creates for the advertiser. The analysis in this case helps to shed light on and derive insights about the trade-offs that an advertiser faces when she deploys different attribution Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising methods. As we will show, although some methods are more accurate as measurement methods, they may result in undesired equilibrium consequences for advertisers, publishers, or the market as a whole.</p><p>The analysis we perform assists in gauging the potential benefit of improved market efficiency from the deployment of attribution methods under the current advertising market structure, in contrast to the approaches that call for structural market changes by platforms. When analyzing advertising market efficiencies, the prior literature has often focused on the potential of a method to increase ad allocation efficiency, with the goal of increasing social welfare. Such increase in welfare and allocation efficiency has often come at the expense of the profits of advertisers, through increased rent on the publisher side. Our focus on the division of profits between the advertisers and publishers contributes to this literature by emphasizing the trade-off between allocation efficiency and advertiser profits. Because advertisers today (and especially the large ones) are questioning the effectiveness of their campaigns, the results from our research sheds light on how the implementation of attribution methods may impact the incentives of advertisers to stay in the market. A second focus of the prior research on method optimality tries to asses which attribution method is "best," in the sense that it recovers the true uncertain state of the market. As we will show, a more accurate measurement method may not always be more profitable for an advertiser because of the indirect equilibrium effects it has. We thus question the assumption that more accurate measurement methods that lead to increased competition will increase the advertiser's profits or the ad allocation efficiency in the market. Our results show that there exists a complex interaction between ad allocation efficiency, measurement accuracy, and advertiser and publisher profits.</p><p>In Section 3, we introduce our two-period game theoretical model. The model consists of consumers, two publishers, and three competing advertisers engaged in an advertising campaign. The consumers are homogeneous and visit each publisher probabilistically, in which case they are exposed to ads. Because the visit patterns by consumers are stochastic, advertisers and publishers have uncertainty about realized ad exposures and their effects. When consumers are exposed to ads, they may take an action we call "conversion" (e.g., clicking an ad, pressing the "like" button, watching a video), which generates value for the advertiser. Because the consumer may see multiple ads, the returns to additional ads may be increasing or decreasing. We focus primarily on decreasing ad returns, but mention the impact of increasing returns where appropriate. All proofs in the paper appear in the appendix.</p><p>Advertisers bid in ad auctions and try to maximize their profits. One of the advertisers is a global advertiser, who runs the campaign on both publishers, and the other two advertisers are local advertisers, each running a campaign on one publisher only. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The ad allocation mechanism we consider is a standard second-price auction with impression pricing (CPM). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Although we use the term "publishers," we have in mind large publishers such as Google or Facebook. The publishers in our model do not take the role of an ad network that allocates ads among different websites, which is why we interchangeably use the terms "publisher" and "platform."</p><p>Section 4 contains a benchmark analysis that compares a global advertiser who does not use attribution to an optimal advertiser who has complete market information. We find that when not using attribution, both the global and the local advertisers will benefit compared with the case when all advertisers are local, because of reduced competition resulting from ad externalities. In this case, the profits of popular publishers decrease, giving a plausible explanation for why large publishers (such as Google) provide free attribution solutions to large advertisers to increase their competitiveness. We also find that when advertisers value conversions highly, gaining full market information does not increase profits and is useless. This result shows that advertisers with high-value consumers should not expect to benefit from implementing attribution.</p><p>Section 5 looks at the impact of deploying an attribution solution for the global advertiser. We show that the attribution problem is an instance of the team problem identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holmstrom (1982)</ref>, implying that a suboptimal number of ads will be purchased in the market and that attribution will never achieve the optimal allocation an advertiser could achieve with complete information. We then analyze two common attribution schemes: last-touch attribution and Shapley value attribution based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shapley (1952)</ref>.</p><p>In equilibrium, we find that last-touch attribution incentivizes an increase in ad exposures. This increase results in overexposure beyond the optimal level of advertising, limiting the benefit for the global advertiser. We find that there is no condition in which last-touch attribution yields higher profits for the global advertiser compared with both the Shapley value and to not using attribution. The Shapley value, however, will increase ad exposure at the unpopular publisher, but may decrease ad exposure at the popular publisher, resulting in increased profits compared with last-touch attribution when one of the publishers is unpopular. Counterintuitively, we also find that last-touch attribution benefits publishers that come earlier in the conversion funnel of a consumer. The intuition behind these results stems from the fact that last-touch attribution is extreme in allocating the full effect of the externality to the second publisher in the chain of visits. The Shapley value, in contrast, is order agnostic and generally does not overincentivize exposure at both publishers.</p><p>Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> These properties raise two questions about the optimality of these attribution methods. Section 5.2 looks at the ad allocation efficiency in a market with attribution. As attribution is geared to increase advertiser profits, this increase may result in decreased allocation efficiency. This is because resolving uncertainties does not necessarily resolve externalities absent a centralized price coordination mechanism. We surprisingly find that last-touch attribution may increase efficiency beyond what is achievable when an advertiser has full market information. This is not the case for the Shapley value, however, which decreases market efficiency. Section 5.3 tries to determine how far each method is from reaching the maximal potential profit for an advertiser. We find that all methods perform well in the worst-case scenario, yielding more than 85% of potential profit to the advertiser. Altogether, these results show a trade-off between attribution methods that improve the overall market allocation efficiency and methods that allow individual advertisers to increase their profits.</p><p>Section 5.4 looks further into the question of the lingering stickiness and impact of last-touch attribution through a comparative statics analysis. When we fix the attribution method, changing the market parameters or changing ad effectiveness does not have an equal effect on the global advertiser's profit. If the advertiser can increase the effectiveness of her ad copy to elicit earlier conversions in the funnel, using last-touch attribution will increase the profit of the advertiser, whereas the Shapley value and no-attribution (NA) methods will decrease the advertiser's profit. This stability may be another reason for the popularity of lasttouch attribution. We also find, in Section 5.5, conditions where the Shapley value not only decreases the profit of the global advertiser, but also decreases the revenue of both publishers, yielding a lose-lose-lose scenario. In contrast, last-touch attribution increases the profits of the global advertiser and the publishers. When we focus on ad prices, we find that the global advertiser will pay higher ad prices when using last-touch attribution and lower ad prices when using the Shapley value. This may partially explain the pricing trend observed in advertising markets today.</p><p>The discussion in Section 6 concludes by analyzing the limitations of the findings and implications for theory and practice. Our analysis shows that the effects of attribution are not trivial and that the benefits may be limited in many cases. In general, attribution will not yield the optimal (complete information) profit for an advertiser because of the team problem it creates. Moreover, there are cases when even gaining full information would not change the actions of the advertiser, yielding little gain from attribution. Analyzing these limitations has allowed us to give further guidance and understanding to advertisers considering the development and deployment of an attribution technology. Despite these limitations, we find that under a wide range of conditions, attribution does improve the profits of a global advertiser, may increase the ad allocation efficiency in the market, and, in certain cases, also increases the profits of publishers while at the same time increasing the profit of global advertisers. Thus, attribution is a viable advertiser-side alternative to price adjustment mechanisms or using information sharing on the publisher side.</p></div>

In these cases, the auctioneer can change their auction mechanism to adjust the efficiency of the ad allocation and correct for the externalities. We contribute to this research by analyzing the second-price auction when externalities exist among publishers, but not on the same publisher, preventing them from correcting for the externality.</p><p>In the past few years, the advertising industry has shown increased interest in improved attribution methods. In a recent survey by <ref type="bibr">Econsultancy (2012, pp. 6, 13)</ref> and Google, 54% of advertisers indicated they used a last-touch method, whereas 42% indicated that being "unsure of how to choose the appropriate method/model of attribution" is an impediment to adopting an attribution method. Research focusing on the advertiser's problem of measuring and compensating multiple publishers is quite recent, however, with the majority focusing on empirical applications to specific campaign formats. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tucker (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al. (2016)</ref> analyze the impact of better attribution technology on campaign decisions by advertisers.

In their model, the authors look at designing a bidding and pricing mechanism that is efficient and maximizes social welfare when there are externalities among publishers.

The main conclusions are that an advertiser can take advantage of her private information to select different payment schemes. Our analysis, in contrast, tries to show that a significant challenge still faces the advertiser when she is limited to a specific payment scheme and when the information structure in the market is symmetric. These challenges can sometimes be mitigated by an attribution method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model of Consumers, Advertisers, and Publishers</head><p>Consider a two-period market with three types of players: three advertisers, two publishers, and a continuous mass of homogenous consumers with measure 1. We use the term "publisher" to denote a platform that facilitates the sale of advertising and its delivery.</p><p>As such, publishers are websites that both sell ads directly and display them to consumers (such as Google's search engine or Facebook). We assume these large publishers will not share information between them because of competitive or regulatory restrictions. The case of platforms that can allocate ads between different publishers in their network in the face of attribution is left as a promising avenue for future work. We denote the two publishers as j ∈ {1, 2}. Two advertisers in the market are local advertisers who advertise on only one of the publishers, and one is global and advertises on both publishers. The global/ local structure is common in the combinatorial auctions literature (when bidders can bid on more than one item; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Krishna and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rosenthal 1996, Ausubel and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baranov 2013)</ref> and allows us to fully characterize the equilibrium behavior of all players in the market. In addition, this assumption allows us to compare the effects of moving from running a single-publisher campaign to a multipublisher campaign. Our primary focus is on analyzing the competition of the global advertiser with the local advertisers, which we label i ∈ {G, 1, 2}, respectively. The online appendix analyzes the case of two global advertisers.</p><p>In the market, consumers generate revenue to the advertisers through ad exposures on publisher websites, which are bought in ad auctions conducted by each publisher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Consumers</head><p>Consumers in the model may visit a publisher's website in each time period. If they visit a publisher, they are exposed to ads and may take an action that is valuable to the advertiser, called a conversion. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Visiting publisher websites requires the consumer to decide whether to visit each publisher in each time period and in what order. We assume a consumer can visit each publisher up to once during the two periods, and in period t they visit a publisher with probability p t when (p 1 , p 2 ) is either (p H , p L ) or (p L , p H ) with p H &gt; p L . This specification means that popular websites (p H ) may come earlier or later in the consumer's visit path. As a result, the world has four possible states, which we denote by 1H, 1L, 2H, and 2L. The first state, for example, means that the customer visits publisher 1 first with probability p H and then publisher 2 with probability p L . We assume these states occur with a priori equal probability.</p><p>Modeling the order of visits and decisions to visit in this way allows us to analyze the dynamics emerging from an advertising campaign and to disentangle the potential market power a publisher has from being later (or earlier) in a consumer visit path, or being popular (p H ) or unpopular (p L ) in the market. In addition, modeling order uncertainty and visit uncertainty in such a way captures advertisers' uncertainty about the response of consumers to advertising.</p><p>When a consumer visits either of the two publishers, she is exposed to an ad from one of the advertisers on the platform. The process that determines ad exposures is a second-price auction and is described in detail in the following section. Contingent on being exposed to ads, we assume that the consumer makes a conversion decision following every ad exposure. After being exposed to one ad, the consumer converts with probability γ. After being exposed to a second ad, the consumer converts with probability (1 + d)γ; d determines the externality that the first ad may have on the second ad if Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> it is shown. When −1 &lt; d &lt; 0, advertising has positive but decreasing returns, and when 1 &gt; d &gt; 0, advertising has positive and increasing returns. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> From the point of view of an advertiser, exposing a consumer to one ad yields a conversion with probability γ, and exposing a consumer to two ads yields a conversion with probability γ + γ(1 + d). If, for example, consumers can convert only once, but the second ad will have a similar effect as the first ad on nonconverted consumers, then d = −γ.</p></div>

In this auction, if b 11 &gt; b 21 , then advertiser 1 wins the auction and pays b 21 . We assume that ties in bidding are broken randomly, though in our model they will appear with measure zero. We have chosen to focus on CPM pricing, because it allows analyzing a wide range of parameters in closed form. Moreover, this payment method is popular in the market, and especially within display advertising where attribution is the most relevant.

In fact, doing so may lead to losing auctions you would've otherwise won at no additional cost" <ref type="bibr">(Facebook 2017, p. 11)</ref>.

Local advertisers show ads only on one platform, and as a result submit only one bid. Moreover, because these advertisers do not compete for advertising on multiple publishers, they do not face an attribution problem-all of their sales will be attributed to the specific platform where they advertise.

If a bidder bids above the highest bid of the other bidder, they can increase (or decrease) their bid without affecting their or the other bidder's profit or the allocation of the auction items. Therefore, when we report equilibrium bidding strategies, we will report the continuously differentiable strategies, but also indicate when the advertisers can lower their bids from this equilibrium while maintaining the same profit.</p><p>An analysis of the full equilibrium without attribution (called NA) shows the following results about the equilibrium bids of the global advertiser.</p><p>Lemma 1. When a global advertiser competes with two local advertisers, we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">• The global advertiser bids b * G,NA γv G (p H +p L ) p H +p L −2dp H p L v</formula><p>and can reduce their bid when b * G,NA &gt; γ.

It is interesting to see that when the returns to advertising are decreasing (but still positive), the global advertiser will lower her bids, whereas she will increase them when d &gt; 0. When d &lt; 0, the ability to track the same customer over multiple publishers increases the potential profit the advertiser can achieve, but decreases the average potential profit per publisher the advertiser will achieve. Thus, maximizing her profit requires the global advertiser to lower her bid. When d &gt; 0, however, the externality is strong enough that even increasing her bid will compensate the global advertiser in her revenue Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> more than the increased cost paid because of stronger competition with the local advertiser.</p><p>The third item begins to shed light on which of the publishers may benefit more from efficiency in the market when advertisers become more global. As can be seen, the global advertiser will underestimate the potential income from the popular publisher and will bid less than she could have bid if the market had no uncertainty in it.</p><p>Using the bidding strategies from Lemma 1, we can find the expected profits of the global and local advertisers and the revenues of the publishers. We can then compare them to the case when there are no global advertisers. The following proposition summarizes the results.</p><p>Proposition 1.</p><p>• The profit of the global advertiser is higher than if it was local. The profit of a local advertiser is higher than if it was competing with a local advertiser when d &lt; 0 and lower otherwise.</p><p>• When d &gt; 0 and v &gt;</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">4d 2 p H p L +4dp L +1 √ −1 2(d 2 p H p L +dp L )</formula><p>, there is no value in using attribution.</p><p>• When d &lt; 0, the expected revenue of each publisher decreases when one advertiser is global compared with when all advertisers are local.</p><p>Proposition 1 shows that when advertising returns are positive, the profit of the global advertiser will increase even without a sophisticated and efficient allocation of advertising budgets. A somewhat surprising result is also that the profits of the local advertisers are increasing when global advertisers can target their customers better and d &lt; 0. This phenomenon is a consequence of the weaker bidding strategy the global advertiser is employing, which allows the local advertiser to pay less than she would have paid if she were competing with another local advertiser. Essentially, we see that in this case decreasing advertising returns and the ability to track users across publishers softens the competition in the market.</p><p>The second item of the proposition reveals another interesting result: if advertising returns are increasing and the global advertiser's valuation for consumers is high enough, the profit when not using any attribution method will be as high as the optimal profit when the state of the world is known. The intuition behind this result is that when d and v are large enough, the optimal bid of the global advertiser at both publishers is higher than the highest bid of a local advertiser. In this case, the second-price auction serves as insurance for the global advertiser against paying too much per impression. Thus, as long as the bid without attribution is set higher than the bid of the local advertiser, the advertiser will reach maximal profit even without attribution.</p><p>Finally, we see that when d &lt; 0, publishers will have lower revenues compared with when all advertisers are local. The publishers in this market suffer from two effects. Because one advertiser now faces decreasing returns, her potential extracted value from consumers is lowered, which lowers the rent that the publishers can extract. In addition to that, because the global advertiser also bids with a weaker strategy, the local advertiser pays less for the same ads than she would have paid if she were competing with a local advertiser.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, the popular publisher will suffer the biggest loss of revenue as a corollary to Lemma 1. This may partially explain why large publishers (such as Google and Facebook) are eager to provide advertisers with analytics technology (including attribution), which is oftentimes provided for free. If the publishers believe they are more frequented by the target customers of the advertisers, they may benefit from the advertisers using such technology.</p><p>These results emphasize how externalities and uncertainty change ad allocation and profits in the market when consumers multihome and an advertiser switches to running a multipublisher campaign. The profits of publishers decrease because the uncertainty about visits lowers the efficiency of the second-price auction in allocating ads and in extracting rent, but also decreases the level of competition between the advertisers. Many solutions for this problem focus on what publishers and platforms can do to improve the allocation. For example, data are aggregated across a network to create an information asymmetry that can be used to price ads differently, and consequentially increase the profits of publishers. In our setup, publishers will not be able to know whether a consumer is multihoming or not and respond accordingly. However, advertisers are able to respond to these effects by using the information they collect in the campaign. In the next sections, we focus on the effect of attribution-the process by which advertisers try to resolve the uncertainty they face and improve their competitive positioning in the market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The Role of Attribution</head><p>The previous section found that the global advertiser resorts to submitting an equal bid to both publishers because of the uncertainty about the market state. The goal of an attribution function is to associate revenues with specific publishers. The advertiser can then change her bids until the associated attribution of each publisher is optimized.</p><p>Many advertisers define campaign attribution as "the process by which marketers quantify the contribution of various media in an ad campaign to its desired impact" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bager and Laszlo 2015)</ref>. The result of this process (typically) is an allocation of credit to the two publishers such that the sum of the allocation equals the total campaign revenue. We will therefore make the following definition.</p><p>Definition 1 (Attribution Function). An attribution function separates the revenue r of a campaign that uses Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising publishers 1 and 2 to two values, A 1 ( r) and A 2 ( r), s.t. r = A 1 ( r) + A 2 ( r). The revenue A j is attributed to publisher j.</p><p>The results of an attribution function are then typically used to estimate the ROI attributed to each publisher (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borgs et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Geyik et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Li et al. 2016</ref>) and bids are then changed to equalize the ROI between the different platforms. Because maximizing ROI does not necessarily maximize profit, we will analyze the impact of the attribution function when the advertiser sets the bids such that the attributed profit to each publisher is maximized: <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>Definition 2 (Attribution Maximizing Bids).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">b * G1 arg max b G1 A 1 (r(b G1 , b G2 )) − c 1 (b G1 , b G2 ), b * G2 arg max b G2 A 2 (r(b G1 , b G2 )) − c 2 (b G1 , b G2 ).</formula><p>In this definition, r(•, •) is the total revenue generated by the campaign, and c j (•, •) is the cost associated with publisher j when bids b G1 and b G2 are submitted. Because attribution is calculated during a campaign or after a campaign is run, the revenue r and costs c are the actual revenue and costs observed following the campaign, and hence reflect the true state of the world facing the advertiser.</p><p>Definition 2 is equivalent to the definition of a Nash equilibrium where the two publishers are allocated a share of the revenue. As such, the attribution process can be seen as creating a virtual competition between the two publishers that is being simulated by the advertiser to find the equilibrium allocation. In this case, the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holmstrom (1982)</ref> holds, and the allocation of bids will be an inefficient advertising effort (ad exposure). Consequentially, some publishers will always be allocated bids (or budgets) that are suboptimal.</p><p>Because there are many functions for which r = A 1 (r) + A 2 ( r), the advertiser's goal is to pick an attribution function that maximizes her profit subject to the constraint that each publisher maximizes its individual attributed profit. When the first-order conditions are sufficient for Definition 2, the following first-order conditions will hold for the optimal bids defined in Definition 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∂A 1 (r(b * G1 , b * G2 )) ∂b G1 ∂c 1 (b * G1 , b * G2 ) ∂b G1 , ∂A 2 (r(b * G1 , b * G2 )) ∂b G2 ∂c 2 (b * G1 , b * G2 ) ∂b G2 . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>Using this set of first-order conditions as a constraint, we can now write the full attribution problem as follows.</p><p>Definition 3 (Attribution Problem).</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">max A 1 , A 2 π(b * G1 , b * G1 ) (5) s.t. A 1 (r) + A 2 (r) r,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">∂A 1 (r(b * G1 , b * G2 )) ∂b G1 ∂c 1 (b * G1 , b * G2 ) ∂b G1 , ∂A 2 (r(b * G1 , b * G2 )) ∂b G2 ∂c 2 (b * G1 , b * G2 ) ∂b G2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Definition 3 shows that the goal of the advertiser is to maximize her profit over the space of available attribution functions within the constraints defining the problem. This complex optimal control problem does not necessarily have a closed-form solution. The solution also highly depends on the parameters of the profit function of the campaign, which is why we focus on analyzing two commonly used attribution mechanisms, namely, the LT method and the Sh method. The online appendix shows that these methods belong to a family of methods we call fixed externality share methods and analyzes their efficiency. In what follows, we compare these popular attribution functions to two benchmarks-the case of no attribution (NA) and the optimal allocation possible when there is no market uncertainty (Opt). Using this analysis, we are also able to calculate an upper bound on how optimal (or suboptimal) each attribution method is, and under what conditions. We perform the analysis in the case of decreasing returns (d &lt; 0) and discuss the impact of increasing returns in the conclusion.</p></div>

(9)</formula><p>Inspecting the two attribution functions, we see that increasing the bid at publisher 1 will decrease the attributed revenue to publisher 2 when d &lt; 0 and will increase it when d &gt; 0 because of the externality term. In other words, publisher 2 receives (or suffers) the impact of the externality between the publishers because it comes later in the visit process of the consumer.</p><p>It is easy to show that when using the last-touch attribution function, the first-order conditions for the optimal bids are also sufficient to fulfill the conditions in Definition 2 on the optimal bids. Hence, we can calculate the new equilibrium bidding strategies of the local and global bidders and analyze the resulting profit of each bidder.</p><p>Performing the analysis yields the following result:</p><p>Proposition 2. Using last-touch attribution, we have the following:</p><p>• The global advertiser will bid b *</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Gj 1 γv G if j 1 is the first publisher visited and b * Gj 2 γv G + p j 1 dγv 2</formula><p>G if j 2 is the second publisher visited.

This is because, in a concave revenue function, earlier ad impressions have a negative externality on later impressions, and not taking them into account overestimates the impact of earlier impressions. In addition to the earlier publisher benefitting, we find that the bid at the second publisher is lower when d &lt; 0, and even lower when the first publisher is popular. That means that niche publishers that come later in a conversion funnel will suffer more when last-touch attribution is applied.</p><p>Finally, we see that applying last-touch attribution actually reduces the profit of the advertiser below the profit she would make without using any attribution function at all, unless p L is small (has to be less than 1/3, and usually smaller). When p L is small, the market is one where most consumers visit only one publisher. In that case, the timing of visits of customers is indicative of both which has the higher probability of visit and which is visited first. Last-touch attribution is well suited to measure order effects, if they are indicative of the actual process that determines conversions, and when most consumers visit only one publisher.</p><p>This analysis gives a potential explanation for why advertisers have chosen to use last-touch attribution beyond the simplicity of its implementation. In a market where externalities are small in magnitude because of low co-occurrence of visits of customers, last-touch attribution can be used to properly model the order of visits and improve the profits of advertisers compared with not using attribution.</p><p>Another attribution method that has been proposed in the literature is using the Shapley value to attribute profit to publishers. This method has become popular recently as the "data-driven" method implemented in Google's attribution solution. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shapley (1952)</ref> value is a cooperative game theory solution concept that allocates value created among players in a cooperative game. The value is defined as follows for our model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A Sh 1 r(b 1 , b 2 ) − r(0, b 2 ) + r(b 1 , 0) − r(0, 0) 2 A Sh 2 r(b 1 , b 2 ) − r(b 1 , 0) + r(0, b 2 ) − r(0, 0) 2 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>The value takes the average marginal contribution of the publishers at the points (b 1 , b 2 ) and (b 1 , 0) for publisher 1 and (b 1 , b 2 ) and (0, b 2 ) for publisher 2. The reason to focus on the Shapley value is that it has two desirable properties in an attribution function. The first is called the efficiency property, which means that all value created by the players is allocated, and the sum of the values equals the total revenue generated.</p><p>Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising</p><p>The second property, described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Young (1988)</ref>, is called the marginality property, which says that if two players have the same marginal contribution in all possible order of players, their attribution will be equal. Moreover, the Shapley value is agnostic of the actual function that generates conversions and makes no assumptions on the shape of the function. Hence, it is quite robust to model misspecification.</p><p>The analysis of the equilibrium bids and allocation when using Shapley value attribution shows the following result: Proposition 3. When using the Shapley value to optimize the bids of the advertiser and when d &lt; 0, we have the following:</p><p>• When v is low and p L is low, the global advertiser bids less than the optimal value at the popular publisher, and bids above the optimal value otherwise. The global advertiser always bids above the optimal value at the unpopular publisher.</p><p>•</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">When v &lt; 3 √ −1</formula><p>−dp H , the profit using Shapley value attribution is higher than the profit with no attribution. When</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">v ≥ 3 √ −1</formula><p>−dp H , the profit is higher than no attribution if p L is low.</p><p>• There exists a p c L such that if p L &lt; p c L , the profit using Shapley value attribution is higher than both the last-touch and the no-attribution profits.</p><p>• There is no case when d &lt; 0 in which last-touch attribution generates more profit than both no attribution and Shapley value attribution.</p><p>Proposition 3 shows that using the Shapley value as an attribution mechanism is beneficial when the value of a conversion is below some threshold, or for high values of v when p L is small enough. The upper bound on the value of v at the worst case is 3 √ − 1 ≈ 0.732, and increases with lower p H and d closer to zero. Consequentially, the Shapley value increases the profit of a global advertiser for a wide range of parameter values.</p><p>The second item shows that when p L is low enough, implying there is enough asymmetry between the two publishers, the Shapley value yields the highest profit among the three attribution methods we are comparing. The intuition is that in these cases, similarly to the lasttouch method, the Shapley value takes into account the asymmetric effect on conversion, which comes mostly from the popular publisher. Unlike last-touch attribution, however, the Shapley value is order agnostic and thus is better able to take into account the externality imposed by the first visited publisher on the second publisher.</p><p>The last item of the proposition shows the surprising result that last-touch attribution is not beneficial to advertisers on the entire range of the parameters when the other two methods are available. We basically see that for low values of p L , when last-touch attribution is more effective than not using attribution, the Shapley value is even more effective, whereas for high values of p L , either no attribution or the Shapley value is more effective.</p><p>Another interesting conclusion from this analysis is that when visit probabilities are high and when valuations are high, there is little benefit to using any attribution process. This result can explain why advertisers may be dissatisfied after they employ an attribution method and discover no benefit (or even decreased profits). The intuition behind this result is that when p H and v are high enough, the optimal bids of the advertisers when they have complete information will be to bid the same value at both publishers. In this case, there will be no difference in bidding strategies between not having any information (the NA case) and having complete information (the Opt case). If the global advertiser decides to apply an attribution method in this setting, she will find out that she cannot improve her profit beyond the optimal profit, and will be surprised to learn that attribution has little value for her.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Impact on Ad Allocation Efficiency</head><p>Advertisers usually see the goal of attribution as helping them to compete in the market against better informed advertisers. Publishers may also prefer that advertisers use specific attribution methods versus others, as it may cause overbidding and enhance their profits. The research on uncertainty in advertising markets that takes the publisher perspective often focuses on methods that will increase the ad allocation efficiency in the market. It is unclear, however, whether allocation efficiency should be the goal of an advertising network or platform, or of an advertiser. Efficient allocation mechanisms maximize welfare, but not necessarily the profit of the platform, which is the market designer in this case. For example, the commonly used second-price auction is efficient for one item, but does not maximize the profit of the platform in many cases.</p><p>To analyze the efficiency of ad allocation, we will focus on the welfare implications of uncertainty and attribution. Focusing on welfare allows us to perform an analysis without too many assumptions about the allocation mechanism in the market, which may impact ad allocation but not total welfare. The total welfare in our model is the sum of profits of advertisers and publishers. Because the income of publishers comprises only transfers from advertisers, the total welfare is equal to the sum of revenues of advertisers. This simplifying observation allows us to find the maximum potential welfare without any assumption about the specific ad mechanism the publishers may use. Because the welfare is equal to the sum of advertiser revenues, the most efficient ad allocation is the one that generates the most revenue from visiting consumers, conditional on their visit path.</p><p>After we find this revenue, we compare it to the revenues achieved by the advertisers when they use the different attribution methods we analyze (NA, Sh, LT, and Opt) and when the publishers use the second-price auction we described before.</p><p>Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> Performing the analysis yields the following result for the optimal outcome: Lemma 2. When d &lt; 0, the maximum expected revenue possible in the market is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">1 12 γ ( p H (d 3 p L + 3d 2 p L + 3dp L + 8) + 8p L ).</formula><p>The revenue increases with p H , p L , and d.</p><p>Although it is quite straightforward to find the welfare maximizing allocation, 10 calculating the total market revenue is surprisingly complex for the different attribution methods. The difficulty comes from the fact that the global advertiser, who is exposed to externalities, usually uses nonlinear bidding strategies in equilibrium. This, in turn, makes it difficult to calculate the revenues of the local advertisers. We are able to find closed-form results for the market revenues in the NA, LT, and Sh cases. We are unable to find a closed form for the total revenue in the Opt case, and we therefore use numerical computation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the results of this analysis for two cases. Both panels display the ratio of the expected revenue of advertisers using the methods we analyzed to the expected revenue of advertisers in the optimal allocation scenario. In the left panel, the worst-case scenario for the Shapley value is displayed, which occurs when p H = 1, d = −1, and p L = 1. In this extreme case, the advertisers would like to show only the first ad in a sequence (as the second is worthless). Even in this extreme case, the Shapley value is able to achieve 94.33% of the potential maximum welfare. Numerical analysis shows that last-touch attribution achieves 94.5% and no attribution reaches 95.4% in their respective worst-case scenarios. These results generally illustrate that market inefficiency is not high even when advertisers have complete certainty about the market state.</p><p>The right panel presents the case of p H = 1/2, p L = 1/4, and d = −1/4. All of the methods in this case reach over 99% of the maximum potential welfare, and the differences between them are very small. We see that lasttouch attribution is quite efficient for low values of p L . These are the cases where most visits go to one publisher and the externality is very small. As in the case of the global advertiser's profit before, such markets are ideal for using a method like last-touch attribution. When p L is higher, we see that the Shapley value improves efficiency beyond last-touch attribution, but is unable to improve it above the cases of Opt and no attribution. Because the Shapley value is designed as a method to give advantage to advertisers and not to generate market efficiency, this result is not surprising.</p><p>The conclusion from the analysis is that attribution methods may have a nontrivial impact on welfare. A method like last-touch attribution, that encourages an advertiser to overbid, may increase welfare by transferring revenue to the publishers and to the local advertisers. A method like the Shapley value, that may create less aggressive bidding, may actually lower welfare. In all cases, however, the decrease in welfare is not dramatic compared with having complete information. The majority of the impact of attribution Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising methods will be from transferring profits from publishers to advertisers, but not by decreasing allocation efficiency in the market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Optimality for Advertisers</head><p>Questions that naturally arise from the results of the previous section are how well the different attribution methods perform and how far they are from the optimal profit that an advertiser can achieve with full information (Opt). To perform this analysis, we calculate the ratio of the expected profits π * NA , π * LT , and π * Sh for no attribution, last-touch attribution, and Shapley value attribution, respectively, to the optimal expected profit π * Opt when d &lt; 0. We call these ratios the conditional ratios on v. We further integrate the expressions for the expected profits over v and then take their ratios. We call these ratios the unconditional ratios. For example, for the Shapley value, the conditional ratio is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">π * Sh π *</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opt</head><p>, and the unconditional ratio is</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">∫ 1 0 π * Sh dv ∫ 1 0 π * Opt dv .</formula><p>For each of the ratios, we calculate the parameter values where they achieve their minimum and maximum. Because the expressions do not have closed forms, we perform a numeric analysis to find these values. 11 For completeness, the expressions are detailed in the appendix.</p><p>The conditional ratio indicates how each method performs for specific environment values as well as consumer values for an action, whereas the unconditional ratio gives the advertiser an indication of how their profit will deviate from optimum over multiple campaigns on average. This analysis can naturally be extended to include distributions for values of p H , p L , and d, though these parameters should fluctuate less often than the values of conversions.</p><p>The results of the analysis show that all methods achieve a maximum ratio of 1 for different parameter values. As such, there are multiple conditions under which each method may be optimal, which is why we focus on the worst-case outcomes. When analyzing the worst and average worst-case scenarios, we find that in the conditional case, the ratios are all minimized when p H = 1, v = 1, and d = −1. In other words, all methods perform the worst in the extreme case when one publisher is visited all the time and where only the first impression has impact on the consumer (because d = −1). The minimal ratios are 0.875 for the Shapley and lasttouch methods, and~0.888 for the no-attribution method. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the value of the ratio when p H = 1, d = −1, and v = 1 for different values of p L . We also see in this figure that in this extreme case the Shapley value performs quite well when p L &lt; 0.5, with profits achieving 90% of the potential optimal profit.</p><p>The results from the analysis of the unconditional ratios also show that the minima are achieved at the extreme cases when p H = 1 and d = −1. In this case, not using attribution achieves 93.9% of the optimal profit, the Shapley value achieves 92.8%, and last-touch attribution achieves 92%. We also see that when p L &lt; 0.4, the Shapley value achieves at least 95% of the optimal profit, whereas when p L &gt; 0.5, using no attribution achieves at least 95% of the profit.</p><p>These results taken together illustrate the implications of the propositions from the previous sections. When the asymmetry between publishers or the effect Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> of the second ad is not substantial, using attribution methods may be countereffective for an advertiser, as it will reduce the effectiveness of advertising by creating a competition between publishers when one is not needed. When there is enough asymmetry, however, or when the externality is strong, using attribution, and particularly the Shapley value may yield advertiser profits that are close to optimal.</p><p>An additional point in the interpretation of these results is that because our model only has two publishers, we expect the effect of full information to not yield as much improvement in allocation efficiency as in the case of competition between a larger number of publishers. Similarly to the case of a centralized planner vs an oligopoly, increasing the number of competing firms will make the equilibrium result closer to the Pareto-efficient outcomes. As campaigns become more complex and with more publishers, we expect the effect of attribution to be more noticeable when compared with not using attribution and for these results to be sharpened.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Comparative Statics</head><p>The conclusion of the previous section was that an attribution scheme may not necessarily benefit advertisers compared with not using attribution at all. In this section, we analyze the impact of changes in the environment on the profits of advertisers using different schemes to understand the potential robustness of each attribution method.</p><p>Integrating an attribution method into an advertiser's campaign requires data integration from multiple sources and fine tuning the algorithm parameters to match the market state. When markets change (for example, when one publisher becomes more popular), it is desirable that an attribution scheme remains as effective and not require replacement or reconfiguration.</p><p>We perform a comparative statics analysis on the outcomes from the previous sections to check the robustness of the different attribution schemes to market changes. The analysis reveals the following: Proposition 4. When market parameters change, we have the following:</p><p>• The profit of the global advertiser increases under all three methods (LT, NA, Sh) with an increase in γ, d, v, or p H .</p><p>• The profit of the global advertiser increases with p L only when v is small enough.</p><p>Proposition 4 shows that the attribution methods we analyze are robust to market changes unless p L changes and the asymmetry between the publishers decreases for high values of v. When p L increases, the effect of the externality increases, which may lower the benefit of the attribution schemes (and increase the bias from the no-attribution method), because of the increased possibility of seeing the same consumer twice in the campaign and the increased bid at the publisher with lower visit popularity. This effect increases competition and may decrease the profit of the advertisers if they mostly win impressions, which happen when v is high. If v is low enough, the increased visit probability p L contributes to increased revenues, but the increase in cost does not offset it and the profits increase.</p><p>In contrast to these results, the expected optimal profit (when there is no market uncertainty) increases for an increase of any parameter. One conclusion is that for an advertiser with a high value for consumers, attribution may be a double edged-sword if she advertises on many websites, including nonpopular ones.</p><p>Another action an advertiser may take is to try and influence consumers by changing her ads so they have a stronger effect in the first impression by increasing γ toγ &gt; γ while maintaining the overall conversion rate after seeing two ads at γ + γ(1 + d). In this case, the advertiser controls how conversions are allocated between the first and second impressions, for examples by changing the ad copy.</p><p>The analysis shows the following results:</p><p>Proposition 5. When the advertiser increases the impact of the first impression, we have the following:</p><p>• The distance from the optimal profit will increase without attribution or when using the Shapley value.</p><p>• There is a range of parameters of d, p H , and p L such that if v &gt; 10 √ −1 3 , the distance from the optimal profit will decrease using last-touch attribution.</p><p>• Under last-touch attribution, the attributed revenue to the first publisher will always increase, and will increase for the second publisher only when v is small.</p><p>• Using the Shapley value, there is a range of values of p H such that when p L • v is high enough, the attribution to both publishers decreases.</p><p>The analysis in Proposition 5 sheds more light on the effects of the different attribution methods and which types of publishers should benefit from which methods. The first two items show that when the conversions shift toward the first impression, lasttouch attribution is advantageous for advertisers because it gets closer to the optimal profit. The intuition is similar to that in the case of low p L values found before: when there is high asymmetry between the contribution of each impression, last-touch attribution can benefit the first advertiser by overemphasizing their effect on conversions.</p><p>The last two items compare the effect of increasing γ toγ on the attributed revenue in equilibrium. The results for last-touch attribution are expected and mimic the decrease in distance from optimal profit. We also see that there are cases where both publishers benefit from such a reallocation of conversion rates, which creates a unique case where last-touch attribution increases the profit of the advertiser and the attributed revenues of the publishers. The Shapley value, however, has a range of parameters were all players suffer. Both the distance from optimal profit increases, and in addition, the revenue attributed to both publishers decreases. The difference stems from the fact that the Shapley value allocates the externality d equally between both publishers, and in such a case, if γ is increased toγ, it means that d has decreased and that the attributed revenue to both publishers may decrease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Ad Prices and Publisher Profits</head><p>Finally, we compare the revenues of the two publishers and the expected market price of advertising when using the different schemes. Our goal is to understand how moving from a simple attribution method like last-touch attribution to a more sophisticated method like the Shapley value will influence the ad price dynamics in the market. Proposition 6. When d &lt; 0, we have the following:</p><p>• The first publisher will have a higher revenue under last-touch attribution than under the Shapley value. The second publisher will have a higher revenue under the Shapley value than under last-touch attribution.</p><p>• The expected price of an impression the global advertiser will pay is higher under last-touch attribution than using either the Shapley value or not using attribution.</p><p>Proposition 6 shows that publishers that arrive earlier in a conversion funnel will prefer last-touch attribution over the Shapley value attribution. The intuition comes from the previous results, where the revenue attributed to the first publisher increases under last-touch attribution. This yields more competitive bidding by the global advertiser, which translates to higher publisher profit.</p><p>The second item shows an interesting result that may explain the current market trends in online advertising where ad prices are decreasing after a period of increase for mature technologies such as Google AdWords. When firms moved from not using attribution at all to using last-touch attribution, the price of advertising was expected to increase for the large and global advertisers because of overbidding and increased competition. When they move to more sophisticated (and efficient) methods, the result is a decrease in the price paid per impression because of softening competition. Our model thus provides a prediction for trends in advertising prices that will arise when more advanced measurement technologies are introduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion, Limitations, and Conclusion</head><p>As multipublisher campaigns become common and new advertising technologies appear in the market, advertisers find more opportunities to interact with consumers over multiple touch points. The cumulative effect of advertising creates externalities between individual ad exposures for multihoming consumers, and because these exposures are on different publishers, the measured effectiveness of each publisher will depend on past exposures of each consumer on other publishers. As we have shown using our model of a global advertiser competing with two local advertisers, externalities between exposures coupled with uncertainty about consumer visits to publishers lower the bidding incentives of global advertisers and create inefficiency in the market that decreases the revenues of global advertisers and publishers. Past attempts to analyze this problem have shown that if publishers have an Berman: Beyond the Last Touch: Attribution in Online Advertising <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 5, pp. 771-792, © 2018</ref> INFORMS information advantage, for example, by being able to track consumers over a network, then they can exploit this asymmetry to increase the efficiency of ad allocation in the market through changing the pricing in the market. In contrast to these analyses, our focus on the case of structural uncertainties, in which publishers cannot gain superior information, allows us to analyze the impact and potential for using advertiser-side multitouch attribution. More often than not, publishers will not be able to identify multihoming consumers or estimate the externalities from previous exposures correctly. The results we derive assist in understanding how attribution may serve to change the incentives in an advertising market and potentially benefit advertisers. Unlike the focus on advertising optimality in terms of allocation efficiency and social welfare, we try to understand how advertisers respond to these uncertainties.</p><p>Multitouch attribution uses the information collected by the advertiser during a campaign to estimate the contribution of each ad exposure (touch) to consumer conversions. Our analysis of the optimization problem the advertiser faces when using multitouch attribution shows that this problem is an instance of the team problem identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holmstrom (1982)</ref>. Because of this analogy, attribution methods are not expected to fully help the advertiser reverse the effects of uncertainty and externalities. Furthermore, when taking the equilibrium response of competing advertisers into account, we found that in many cases a simple attribution method such as last-touch attribution may lower the profits of a global advertiser compared with not using attribution at all. Using a method such as the Shapley value, which is less extreme in credit allocation, was found to improve the profits of advertisers. In both of these cases, however, we are able to show that attribution may hold limited potential when an advertiser values consumers highly in the market. In these scenarios, uncertainty about consumer visits would not impact the bidding strategy of an advertiser, and in this case, attribution may not yield any improvement over not using it at all. These findings contribute to the empirical literature on attribution modeling that assumes that more accurate measurement of the uncertain state of the campaign will always benefit advertisers. Our results quite clearly show that attribution might be counterproductive because of its competitive effect.</p><p>Several interesting questions arise from our analysis and hold potential for further research. The first is analyzing attribution as a fully strategic choice by advertisers and publishers, and not just as a measurement technique. The online appendix uses numerical analysis to look at the case of two global advertisers who compete in the market using CPC pricing. We find that our results hold qualitatively, but we also find that different amounts of information held by the global advertisers may cause a softening of the competition in the market. A second constraint in our analysis restricts the publishers to not respond to the actions of the advertisers by changing their auction structure or the market structure. It is possible, however, that when faced with attributing advertisers, publishers may decide to invest in attracting different segments of customers, or develop technology that will allow them to offer behavior-based segmentation to advertisers. Merging the two research areas on behavioral targeting on the publisher side with attribution on advertiser side would be a logical next step in this area.</p><p>A second question is how optimal are the specific attribution methods we analyze in comparison with alternative methods? The online appendix shows that both last-touch attribution and the Shapley value are part of a family of methods we call fixed externality share methods, and that in some cases the Shapley value is optimal, whereas last-touch attribution is never optimal. In a second analysis, we compare the attribution methods to the maximal gain from using mediamix modeling (MMM). In that analysis, which utilizes results from the theory of team compensation, we are able to show that attribution always gains more than MMM because of its access to individual level exposure information. These analyses and our formulation of the attribution problem as an optimal control problem open an interesting area for further research that focuses on finding optimal attribution methods.</p><p>Our paper concludes with an analysis of the welfare implications and stability of attribution methods in changing markets. Because attribution methods are employed by advertisers that are not the market designer, we find that they often create a trade-off between market optimality, measured in allocation efficiency and social welfare, and advertiser optimality, which focuses on increasing an advertiser's profits. The focus on allocation efficiency in prior research often leads to a similar conclusion: increased efficiency comes at the expense of advertiser profits. However, if advertisers are unable to field profitable advertising campaigns in the market, they may decide to leave the market altogether, as recently evidenced by some large advertisers. Focusing on the development of attribution methods and their impact on market outcomes may serve to counteract this trend, and our research takes a step forward in that direction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Proposition 3</head><p>To prove the results, we first find the equilibrium bidding strategies of the local and global advertisers using a method similar to the one in Lemma 1. We find that the local advertiser will continue bidding the expected value, whereas the global advertiser will bid − 2γ( dpLv 2 + 2v) d 2 pH pLv 2 − 4 at the popular publisher and − 2(γdpH v 2 + 2γv) d 2 pH pLv 2 − 4 at the unpopular publisher. Comparing these bids to the optimal bids found in Lemma 1, we find that the bid at the unpopular publisher is always above the optimal bid when using Shapley value attribution. The bid at the popular advertiser is lower than the optimal bid</p><p>pH , and higher otherwise. The expected profit under Shapley value attribution is</p><p>To compare with the profits with no attribution and lasttouch attribution, we limit to the cases of −1 &lt; d &lt; 0, and calculate</p><p>To prove the second item, we solve the inequality π * Sh − π * NA &gt; 0, which holds when v &lt; 3</p><p>The third item is solved in a similar way, solving the two inequalities π * Sh − π * NA &gt; 0 and π * LT − π * Sh &lt; 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Lemma 2</head><p>There are four possible allocations when the consumer visits both publishers, which we label GG, 1G, G2, and 12. Outcome ij means the ad was allocated to advertiser i at publisher 1 and to advertiser j at publisher 2. There are also two possible outcomes when the consumer visits only one of the publishers, either 1 or G at publisher 1 or 2 or G at publisher 2. Each of these outcomes generates specific revenue. For example, outcome GG generates</p><p>We solved four sets of inequalities when the consumers visits both publishers to find the range in which each outcome generates the maximum revenue. Integrating over v G , v 1 , and v 2 when the consumer visits both publishers yields γ 1 12 (d 3 + 3d 2 + 3d + 16) p 1 p 2 when p j is the probability of a visit at publisher j. Similarly, integrating when the consumer visits only one publisher yields 2 3 (p 2 − p 1 (2p 2 − 1)). Summing these two expressions yields the result in the lemma. A simple comparative statics analysis shows the total revenue increases in all three parameters.</p></div>

It is interesting to note that all expected profits are linear in γ, and hence the value of γ does not affect these ratios.
