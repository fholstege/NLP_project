<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, as cannabis was legalized for recreational use in an increasing number of states, it has become more important to understand the effects of cannabis policies, especially on youth. Marketers of other recreational substances are also paying close attention to cannabis policy changes. Alcohol and tobacco companies typically view the cannabis industry as a potential threat and are often found among the opponents to its legalization. However, based on extant research, the treatment effects of recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) and its cross-commodity effects on the alcohol and tobacco industries remain inconclusive. Analyzing large-scale web-based behavioral data, we find that although RCL significantly increases cannabis search, the increase comes from adults only, but not youth. RCL also influences alcohol and tobacco industries asymmetrically: it reduces search volume and advertising effectiveness for alcohol but increases those for tobacco. Hence, cannabis appears to be a substitute for alcohol but not tobacco.</p><p>History: K. Sudhir served as the editor-in-chief and Avi Goldfarb served as associate editor for this article.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many U.S. states witnessed changes in cannabis legislations recently. Different parties hold divergent opinions about such changes, and the impact of recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) on people's attitudes toward and use of cannabis remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhao and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harris 2004, Hall and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kozlowski 2018)</ref>. Because drug abuse may cause severe consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tashkin 1993)</ref>, potentially even more so among youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kandel 1975)</ref>, one question inevitably arises in each state considering the legalization of cannabis for recreational use: if it becomes legal, would people (especially youth) want or use it more <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Loria 2017)</ref>?</p><p>The common belief held by opponents of RCL is that people's interest in cannabis would increase drastically following legalization because of greater social acceptance, availability, and possibly affordability of the substance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hopfer 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Bent 2016</ref>). However, according to previous studies, which are heavily based on self-reported surveys, the impact of cannabis policies is inconclusive. Although some suggest that they affect youth's attitude toward or consumption of cannabis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Laixuthai 1997, Cerdá et al. 2016)</ref>, others indicate weak or no effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thies and Register 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Pacula 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Rusby et al. 2018</ref>. The influences of RCL on adults are also largely open to question <ref type="bibr">Lynskey 2016, Budney and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borodovsky 2017)</ref>. Moreover, prior research has rarely directly compared the potential difference in the effects of RCL on youth versus adults.</p><p>Marketers, policymakers, and researchers are also curious about the cross-commodity relationships among cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barry et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Borchardt 2017</ref>. Fearing the potential threat of recreational cannabis as a rival, big alcohol and tobacco companies often act as opponents of its legalization and sponsor anticannabis campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cohen 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Bloomberg 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Williams 2016</ref>). However, the literature provides inconsistent findings about whether cannabis and alcohol/tobacco are economic substitutes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pacula 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Cameron and Williams 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Zhao and Harris 2004</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see Online Appendix I for a detailed summary of previous findings) and has not directly tested how RCL influences the alcohol and tobacco industries.</p><p>Despite their potential effects on public health and society, cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco businesses are, after all, businesses, and their economic significance cannot be ignored. The recent wave of RCL across the United States could generate $22 billion in sales per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Huddleston 2016)</ref>. Annual revenues of U.S. alcohol and tobacco industries combined are over $300 billion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maloney and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chaudhuri 2017, Statista 2018)</ref>. As with any other business, these businesses attempt to leverage marketing tools to build brand, attract and retain customers, and increase sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Vara 2016)</ref>. According to the most recent Federal Trade Commission releases, annual advertising and promotional spending of alcohol and tobacco companies topped $3.5 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively <ref type="bibr">(Federal Trade Commission 2014</ref>. Cannabis marketers are also actively exploring means of promotion in the states that legalized its consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schrank 2017)</ref>. However, there is rarely any academic research on these substances from a marketing perspective (i.e., considering them as products and investigating the determinants of consumer interest and the performances of their marketing mixes).</p><p>In summary, regarding RCL, several important questions remain largely inconclusive or unanswered. For example, how does people's interest in cannabis change after RCL? Do youth react to the policy change differently from adults? Does RCL affect people's interest in alcohol and tobacco and the marketing performances of alcohol and tobacco companies?</p><p>A review of related literature reveals at least four major limitations/gaps. First, there are mixed results within each stream of literature (e.g., impact of cannabis policy on youth, the cross-commodity relationship between cannabis and alcohol, and the cross-commodity relationship between cannabis and tobacco; see Online Appendix I). Second, little is known about the net treatment effect of RCL. Prior studies typically relied on data from either before or after RCL and thus could not isolate its treatment effect. Third, most studies are based on retrospective surveys asking subjects to recall their drug use patterns in the past. Besides recall bias, socialdesirability bias may also reduce the accuracy of self-reported measures because respondents may be conservative when answering questions about illegal drug use <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thompson and Phua 2005)</ref>. Finally, there is a lack of direct insights for marketers. None of the related studies have examined marketing performance (e.g., advertising effectiveness) as the outcome variable.</p><p>Unlike prior studies, this study analyzes large-scale unobtrusive behavioral data before and after policy change to unveil the treatment effect of RCL using a difference-in-difference (DID) approach and examines various metrics relevant not only to policymakers but also to marketers (e.g., online searches and ad clicks, both of which could reflect consumer interest in the substance). We find a positive treatment effect of RCL on cannabis searched overall. However, the effect is significantly attenuated for youth; that is, RCL has asymmetric effects on adults versus youth. Specifically, RCL is likely to increase cannabis searches among adults only. Among youth, cannabis searches do not increase and tend in fact to decrease after RCL. Moreover, RCL has asymmetric effects on the alcohol versus the tobacco industry: it reduces search volume and ad effectiveness for alcohol but increases those for tobacco. These results indicate a substituting relationship between cannabis and alcohol but a complementing relationship between cannabis and tobacco. Our findings add novel and timely insights based on big data from a marketing perspective to the continuous debates in the literature and provide meaningful implications for policymakers and marketing practitioners in related industries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data and Method</head><p>We obtained large-scale data on online searches, ad impressions, and clicks from a leading U.S.-based web portal from January 2014 to April 2017. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the states that have legalized cannabis for recreational use. The policy changes in six of these states and the District of Columbia (for simplicity, we use the term treated state to refer to each of these states or the District of Columbia hereafter) allow us to adopt a DID natural experiment framework to test the treatment effect of RCL, which requires data from both before and after RCL took effect. In Colorado and Washington, RCL occurred in 2012, which is out of our data period. Hence, we do not consider these two states as treated states. To account for unobserved factors that could drive changes in people's interest in/consumption of cannabis over time, we use the 10 states without any form of cannabis policy change as control states. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The data provided by the portal cover more than 28 million searches and 120 million ad impressions related to the cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco industries in these states. In addition to behavioral data (e.g., searches and ad clicks), we also gained access to the web users' geographic locations, gender, age group, 2 and device indicators (more detailed personal identification information is unknown because of privacy-protection restrictions). Hence, for each state, we analyze aggregated data  <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sundh and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hagquist 2005, Steinberg 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Mining Search Queries</head><p>To test the treatment effect of RCL, we need data before and after the treatment. However, there are no highfrequency longitudinal surveys that constantly track the dynamics of people's interest in cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco in any U.S. state, and such endeavors would be extremely costly/difficult to conduct. Moreover, there is a commonly documented bias in selfreported measures when survey participants are unwilling to reveal their true attitude because of social or legal concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Thompson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Phua 2005, Kim et al. 2018)</ref>. For instance, before cannabis is legalized, people may be conservative when reporting their interest in it. A retrospective survey that asks participants to recall their level of interest in the past tends to have low accuracy and validity as the time lapse increases. Hence, we employ a non-surveybased unobtrusive measure to proxy consumer interest.</p><p>Extant research indicates that keyword search frequency on online search engines serves as a good proxy for people's interest in a subject. Marketing studies have used the search volume of a product to measure consumers' interest in it <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Xiong and Bharadwaj 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Kim and Hanssens 2017</ref>, and finance studies have used the search volume of a firm's stock ticker symbol to measure investors' interest in the stock <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Da et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, deHaan et al. 2015</ref>. Following this literature, we examine online search queries on cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco.</p><p>As detailed in Online Appendix III, we first compile a "seed list" of keywords from various sources of the lexicon for cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco and then expand it using word-embedding techniques. A person interested in cannabis may not necessarily search for the keyword cannabis but rather for its synonyms/slang names/spelling variations instead. Our algorithm ensures the comprehensiveness of the data on related search queries. The main idea of word embedding is to use a word's surrounding context to learn word representations in a low-dimensional, continuous vector space, which is also known as Word2Vec. In the embedding space derived, words/phrases that are semantically similar are close to one another. The technique leverages the key feature of distributedlanguage models <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Turian et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Mikolov et al. 2013</ref>, which have demonstrated success in naturallanguage-processing applications and various artificial intelligence tasks. Using this technique, we represent each search query with a vector of numbers, expand the seed list by examining the neighboring queries in the embedding space following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grbovic et al. (2016)</ref>, and obtain the final list after manual cleaning and deduplication. Based on the expanded list of keywords, we compute the search volume (based on exact match) for each substance. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To adjust for the inherent online activeness of each population group at each time point, the search volume for each substance is scaled by the total volume of all searches in the data (including queries both related and unrelated to the focal substances) of the population group at the corresponding time in the corresponding state (×100 to represent percentage).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Advertising Metrics</head><p>Federal and state laws allow advertisements on the Internet for both alcohol and tobacco products. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We can thus compare the performances of alcohol and tobacco ads before and after RCL (to investigate the cross-commodity effects of RCL on alcohol and tobacco). We do not examine advertising for recreational cannabis because it was prohibited before the policy change and remained scarce after loosened state laws because of federal regulations and publishers' self-imposed policies (Jassy 2017). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We compile data on alcohol and tobacco ads displayed on the web portal. We focus on the most commonly studied performance metric for online advertisers, clickthrough rate, following the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dinner et al. 2014)</ref>. When users are exposed to an online ad impression (i.e., when the ad is loaded and displayed to a user), they may or may not click on it. The clickthrough rate of an ad is the likelihood of clicking on it upon impression-that is, number of clicks number of impressions . Typically, a user will not click on an ad unless he or she is interested in it, and the web portal has already filtered out the cases of accidental clicks ("fat fingers") from the data. Clickthrough rate is a meaningful measure for both adults and youth because, although youth cannot legally purchase alcohol online, they can click on an alcohol ad if they are interested in it. We also collect data on the dollar revenue that the publisher (web portal) generated from displaying the ads and compute revenue per impression (revenue divided by the number of ad impressions). Because a publisher typically does not charge the advertiser unless the ad is clicked on, its revenue per impression is also influenced by users' interest in the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Model</head><p>We estimate the following model for the weekly panel data on each population group (as defined at the </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y ijk β 0 + β 1 Treat k × Post j/k + β 2 Youth i + β 3 Gender i + β 4 Device 1i + β 5 Device 2i + ∑ s γ s State s k + ∑ w δ w Week w j + ε ijk ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Y denotes the outcome variable (search frequency of cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco; clickthrough rate or revenue per impression of alcohol or tobacco ads) of each population group i at time (week) j in state k. Youth (1 for youth; 0 for adult), Gender (1 for female; 0 for male), and Device 1 and Device 2 (indicator for tablet and indicator for mobile, respectively; 0 for desktop) are included to account for the inherent heterogeneity across population groups. The set of dummy variables State s k accounts for state-specific fixed effects (1 when s = k; 0 otherwise), and their coefficients are γ s . Dummy variables Week w j account for time-specific fixed effects (Week w j = 1 when w = j; 0 otherwise), and their coefficients are δ w . Treat k × Post j|k becomes 1 when a treated state (i.e., a state with RCL during the observation period) enters its posttreatment period (i.e., after RCL took effect in this state) and is 0 otherwise. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Hence, β 1 captures the overall/average treatment effect of RCL across all treated states. In an additional analysis reported in Online Appendix VI, we also estimate the treatment effect for each treated state separately.</p><p>To examine the moderating effect of Youth, we modify Equation (1) into</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y ijk β 0 + β 1 Treat k × Post j/k + β 2 Youth i + β 3 Gender i + β 4 Device 1i + β 5 Device 2i + β 6 Treat k × Post j/k × Youth i + ∑ s ζ s State s k × youth i + ∑ w η w Week w j × Youth i + ∑ s γ s State s k + ∑ w δ w Week w J + ε ijk .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, β 6 reflects the moderating effect of youth compared with adults. We estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) with analytic weights because the unit of analysis is population group. As a robustness check, we compute two-way clustered standard errors and find consistent conclusions (see Online Appendix VII).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Effects of RCL on Cannabis Search</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes the estimation results, with cannabis searches as the dependent variable. The coefficient of Treat × Post estimated from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is positive and significant, indicating that RCL increases cannabis searches on average. This coefficient suggests a 16.5% increase in cannabis searches after RCL relative to the pretreatment average across the treated states. However, this increase is mitigated among youth, as indicated by the negative and significant coefficient of Treat × Post × Youth estimated from Equation (2). The sum of the coefficients of Treat × Post and Treat × Post × Youth is −0.0776 (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting a significant decrease in cannabis searches among youth after RCL. To further understand the treatment effects for youth versus adults, we divide the data set into a youth sub-data set and an adult subdata set, estimate the effect within each sub-data set (Online Appendix IX), and find asymmetric results across these two sub-data sets. Specifically, RCL has a positive and significant treatment effect on cannabis searches among adults only, but not among youth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effects of RCL on Alcohol and</head><p>Tobacco Industries Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, panels A and B, reports the effects of RCL on alcohol and tobacco industries. The coefficient of Treat × Post on alcohol searches is negative and significant, indicating reduced interest in alcohol when cannabis is legalized and becomes more available. Based on the coefficient estimated from Equation (1), we can infer a reduction of 10.9% in alcohol searches after RCL relative to the average of the pretreatment period. Hence, cannabis and alcohol may be substitutes for each other. Moreover, the coefficients of Treat × Post on alcohol ad clickthrough rate and publisher's revenue per impression are also negative and significant, providing supplemental evidence on the substituting relationship between cannabis and alcohol. 7 Considering (1) this substituting relationship between alcohol and cannabis and (2) the weakened role of RCL in increasing youth's interest in cannabis compared with that of adults, the effects of RCL on alcohol-related metrics should also be less negative among youth than among adults. This is supported by the positive coefficient of Treat × Post × Youth.</p><p>In comparison, the coefficient of Treat × Post is positive and significant on tobacco searches, indicating that RCL enhances consumer interest in tobacco products. This coefficient suggests an increase of 7.8% in tobacco searches after RCL relative to the pretreatment period. Hence, we find evidence for the complementarity (rather than substitutability) between cannabis and tobacco. Consistently, the treatment effects of RCL are also positive on tobacco ad performance (clickthrough rate and publisher's revenue per impression).</p><p>The coefficients of Treat × Post × Youth are negative, opposite to those of Treat × Post. Hence, the positive impact of RCL on tobacco-related metrics is also mitigated for youth (for similar reasons as in the case of alcohol).</p><p>Separate estimations with the adult sub-data set and youth sub-data set (Online Appendix IX) also confirm these patterns. In summary, for adults, RCL has significant negative treatment effects on alcoholrelated metrics but significant positive effects on tobacco-related metrics, indicating substitutability between cannabis and alcohol and complementarity between cannabis and tobacco. In contrast, such effects are weakened or even reversed for youth. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Testing the DID Assumption</head><p>A key assumption in the DID analysis is that the observed effect does not occur prior to the treatment.</p><p>If the effect occurred in the pretreatment period, something other than the treatment could have been responsible for the observed outcome. We test this assumption following a widely adopted approach in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angrist and Pischke 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Wang and Goldfarb 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Chen et al. 2018</ref>, which splits the key covariate into a series of time indicators (leads and lags) to reveal detailed effects over time. Specifically, for each outcome metric, we estimate the interaction effects of treatment and six time indicators (one for each 4-week period in the 12 weeks before treatment and the 12 weeks after treatment). The base is more than 12 weeks before treatment. Results in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> indicate (1) that the effects in the pretreatment period are nonsignificant and generally flat and (2) that significant effects started to occur only after the treatment.</p><p>The results provide suggestive evidence that the DID assumption is satisfied and that the observed effects can be attributed to the treatment. They also suggest that reverse causality (i.e., pretreatment increase or decrease in the outcome causes the treatment) is unlikely <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wang and Goldfarb 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Robustness Checks</head><p>We conduct additional analyses as robustness checks. First, we find largely consistent patterns when estimating the treatment effect for each treated state separately (Online Appendix VI). Second, we estimate an alternative model following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Israeli (2018)</ref> by replacing the state-specific fixed-effect dummies in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) with a single dummy indicator for all treated states and controlling for state-level characteristics, including demographics (median household income, education, and racial composition) based on Census data and political orientation (Online Appendix VIII). The estimated treatment effects remain consistent. Third, we compute search volumes based on the seed lists before keyword expansion. The results lead to consistent conclusions (Online Appendix X).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Implications for Policymakers, Marketers, and Researchers</head><p>As acknowledged by prior research, the effect of cannabis legislations is an important public policy issue but typically difficult to estimate in empirical research, most of which analyzed survey data collected from the period after policy change and was unable to isolate the exact treatment effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhao and Harris 2004)</ref>. In this study, we employ a natural experiment approach to examine the treatment effect of RCL on cannabis searches and the spillover effects on other pleasure-inducing substances by analyzing big data with unobtrusive behavioral measures from periods before and after the policy change. Results reveal asymmetric effects of RCL on youth versus adults and on the alcohol versus tobacco industries.</p><p>Although the literature has not reached agreement on how cannabis policies affect youth, one major concern of the opponents against RCL is that a loosened policy would induce higher interest in cannabis among youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hopfer 2014)</ref>. However, we find that the increase in online cannabis searches after RCL comes from adults only, not youth. If online searches serve as a reasonable proxy for consumer interest in our context, as suggested by prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hu et al. 2014, Kim and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hanssens 2017)</ref>, our results imply that RCL significantly increases adults' interest in cannabis, but not youth's, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> which is in contrary to the widely held public concern over the effect of cannabis legalization on youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hopfer 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Loria 2017</ref>. One potential limitation of the present research is that the online search data come from one search engine alone. Hence, future researchers can further examine this phenomenon using alternative measures of consumer interest.</p><p>It can also be meaningful for future research to systematically investigate the theoretical mechanism behind our finding. Although alternative explanations may exist, one possible reason that could explain the attenuated treatment effect among youth is their rebellion/deviance tendency 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aseltine 1995)</ref>. The most common types of rebellion are nonconformity (against rules/laws/social standards) and noncompliance (against the authority of adults or parents), and rebellious adolescents feel proud or rewarded when they succeed in provoking societal or parental disapproval <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pickhardt 2011)</ref>. Hence, youth tend to be curious about a substance when it is illegal <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnew 2005)</ref>; however, once legalized or widely accepted, the substance loses its "coolness" because it is less likely to engender disapproval <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Loria 2017)</ref>. Empirical evidence on such psychological tendency was also found in other related contexts. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sundh and Hagquist (2005)</ref> showed how a stricter tobacco policy actually encouraged youth curiosity about tobacco instead of discouraging it. For similar reasons, although RCL may make both youth and adults more aware of and receptive to the substance, a postlegalization increase in people's interest in cannabis would be mitigated or reversed among youth, as backed by our results.

Time indicators −1, −2, and −3 represent pretreatment periods, and 1, 2, and 3 represent posttreatment periods. In each graph, the plot depicts the coefficient of RCL effect at each point of time surrounding the treatment. The thin vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and the thick vertical bars represent 90% confidence intervals. <ref type="bibr">Yang: Frontiers: Effects of Recreational Cannabis Legalization Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 6, pp. 927-936, © 2019 INFORMS</ref> There are two related streams of prior research, and mixed findings have been produced. The first stream examined cross-commodity price elasticity-that is, the effect of a price change for one substance on the consumption of/attitude toward other substances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Saffer and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chaloupka 1999, Cameron and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Williams 2001)</ref>. The second stream provided indirect evidence by analyzing data on hospital visits or traffic accidents (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Model 1993, Chaloupka and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Laixuthai 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In comparison, we provide direct evidence about how cannabis policy change influences (1) people's searches for alcohol and tobacco and (2) advertising effectiveness of alcohol and tobacco sellers.</p><p>These findings on cross-commodity relationships help resolve the conflicting literature and provide distinct implications for practitioners. Historically, both alcohol and tobacco companies have been actively sponsoring/supporting campaigns against RCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cohen 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Williams 2016</ref> because they are strongly concerned that legal marijuana may pose threats to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bloomberg 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Borchardt 2017</ref>). However, our results suggest that tobacco companies may need to reexamine their presumption and that anticannabis legalization is not in their best interest. This is because, although alcohol and cannabis appear to be substitutes, tobacco and cannabis are not (RCL in fact leads to increased interest in tobacco and enhanced effectiveness of tobacco ads). The alcohol industry, by contrast, has valid reasons to be concerned about legal cannabis and may need creative strategies to avoid market decline if RCL passes. The very recent partnership between alcohol giant Constellation and a Canadian cannabis company, Canopy, to develop cannabis-based beverages after cannabis legalization in Canada provides an exemplar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endnotes</head><p>1 Online Appendix II lists all the states where recreational cannabis is illegal, including both (a) the 10 control states where cannabis has remained illegal for all purposes and (b) states that have undergone some form of cannabis policy change other than RCL (decriminalization or medical cannabis legalization). As shown in Online Appendix V, the results remain consistent when we include the second group of states in the model as well while controlling for nonrecreational cannabis policy changes. 2 In addition to search engines, the portal offers various services (e.g., email, blogs, and social groups) that require users to register their age information when creating the accounts. For users without registered accounts, the portal has an algorithm to estimate their ages based on cookies/online activities. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In the cases of anonymous online searches (e.g., under incognito mode), although fresh cookies are created for such users, the portal may still link them with old cookies based on information such as Internet Protocol address, web-browser info, browsing patterns, and so on to infer about user information. The data points will only be dropped when the algorithm fails to find such linkages. 4 Although tobacco ads are strictly banned on most traditional media platforms, the Federal Communications Commission does not currently regulate the internet. No other federal or state laws explicitly restrict online ads for tobacco products, and the state tobacco settlement agreements do not place additional restrictions on participating tobacco companies' internet marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bach 2016</ref>). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The federal Controlled Substances Act makes it unlawful to use a "communication facility" to advertise Schedule 1 drugs, including cannabis. Publishers also impose limits on cannabis advertising. For example, Bing and Twitter prohibit ads for "drugs and related paraphernalia"; Yahoo disallows ads for "drugs which may be legal or decriminalized in some regions, such as marijuana" (see https:// www.cannabisbusinessexecutive.com/2017/08/legal-implications -advertising-cannabis-across-different-media/); and advertisers are not allowed to "promote the sale or use of illegal, prescription, or recreational drugs" on Facebook (see https://www.facebook.com/ policies/ads/prohibited_content/drugs#). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We include only the interaction term Treat k × Post j|k in the model but not Treat k (which indicates whether state k is a treated state or a control state) or Post j|k (which indicates whether week j occurs after RCL in state k) themselves. This is because (a) Treat k is a dummy classifier for the states, and adding it would cause collinearity because we have already included state-specific fixed-effect dummy variables State s k , and (b) Post j|k is conditional on each state k (i.e., its value is specific to each treated state and is always 0 for the control states), and thus Post j|k = Treat k × Post j|k (when Treat k = 1, obviously, Post j|k = Treat k × Post j|k ; when Treat k = 0, Post j|k is always 0 and still equals Treat k × Post j|k ). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The numbers of alcohol and tobacco ads remain largely unchanged before and after RCL based on t-tests. However, because we do not have data on the contents of alcohol/tobacco ads (which might be different in the pre-versus post-RCL periods), we cannot completely rule out the potential endogeneity issue when using advertising metrics as outcome variables. Hence, we only consider the results on ad metrics as supplemental results that complement those on search volume. As an effort to account for potential endogeneity in policy change, we conduct robustness checks using synthetic controls and find consistent results: The estimated coefficients of Treat × Post and Treat × Post × Youth are 0.0880 and −0.1686 (p &lt; 0.05 for both) for cannabis searches, −0.1251 and 0.1772 (p &lt; 0.05 for both) for alcohol searches, and 0.0277 (p &lt; 0.05) and −0.0519 (p &lt; 0.1) for tobacco searches. 8 Some might speculate that youth do not actively search for cannabis online (before or after RCL), which might serve as an alternative explanation for the differential effect among youth. This explanation is unlikely because youth are in fact more active online searchers for cannabis-related information than adults on average (e.g., Youth has a significant positive coefficient, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). 9 Deviance can lead to experimentation with high-risk excitement and rejection of restraints. As young people move past the teen years, they gain more responsibility and are less inclined to deviance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Steinberg 2011)</ref>. According to the reactance theory, youth's consumptions of cannabis and similar substances tend to be expressions of normbreaking or rebellious behavior, a means for them to assert individuality or independence (Loria 2017). 10 For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997)</ref> find that a cannabis price reduction leads to lower rates of motor vehicle accidents. Based on this finding, they conclude that a cannabis price reduction reduces alcohol consumption. The key assumption is that people under the influence of cannabis drive more carefully/slowly than those who are drinking and driving.</p><p>Wang, Xiong, and Yang: Frontiers: Effects of Recreational Cannabis Legalization</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>RCL Dates</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">Wang, Xiong, and Yang: Frontiers: Effects of Recreational Cannabis Legalization</cell></row><row><cell>State</cell><cell>Abbreviation</cell><cell>RCL took effect on</cell></row><row><cell>Alaska</cell><cell>AK</cell><cell>2/24/2015</cell></row><row><cell>California</cell><cell>CA</cell><cell>11/9/2016</cell></row><row><cell>Colorado</cell><cell>CO</cell><cell>12/10/2012</cell></row><row><cell>District of Columbia</cell><cell>DC</cell><cell>2/26/2015</cell></row><row><cell>Maine</cell><cell>ME</cell><cell>1/30/2017</cell></row><row><cell>Massachusetts</cell><cell>MA</cell><cell>12/15/2016</cell></row><row><cell>Nevada</cell><cell>NV</cell><cell>1/1/2017</cell></row><row><cell>Oregon</cell><cell>OR</cell><cell>7/1/2015</cell></row><row><cell>Washington</cell><cell>WA</cell><cell>12/6/2012</cell></row></table></figure>
