<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>C ountermarketing, or efforts to reduce consumption of certain products, has become common in categories such as tobacco, junk food, fossil fuels, and furs. Countermarketing has a particularly long history in the tobacco industry. Efforts to reduce smoking have included excise taxes that increase the cost of consumption, smoke-free restrictions that make consumption less convenient, and antismoking advertising campaigns that highlight the dangers of tobacco use. This article presents an analysis of the relative effectiveness of these different strategies. We find that cigarette excise taxes are the most effective tool for reducing overall cigarette sales, followed by antismoking advertising. Smoke-free restrictions are not found to have a significant effect on cigarette sales. We also investigate how these various policy tools induce product substitution. This issue is of considerable importance because some countermarketing techniques may potentially shift consumers to more dangerous, higher nicotine and tar cigarettes. Specifically, we find that excise taxes levied on a per pack basis rather than based on nicotine levels often shift consumers to more dangerous products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Countermarketing, or efforts to reduce consumption of some specified product, has become common in categories ranging from cigarettes to furs. For the most part, countermarketing activities have focused on goods such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary, high fat foods that pose health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohen 2000)</ref>. Countermarketing activities are probably most associated with the tobacco industry and these activities are typically justified by the economic and health consequences of tobacco usage. Cigarette smoking has been estimated to cause 443,000 premature deaths each year in the United States and imposes healthcare costs and productivity losses of $193 billion each year <ref type="bibr">(CDC 2011)</ref>. As a result, government regulators and advocacy groups have used a variety of countermarketing strategies to reduce tobacco consumption.</p><p>Our research is focused on the tobacco industry and investigates the extent to which countermarketing strategies can change overall cigarette consumption and shift market shares across products with different nicotine levels. First, we investigate the efficacy of various countermarketing activities on cigarette category sales. This is an important topic because antismoking organizations tend to have limited resources and must therefore identify the most effective interventions. Countermarketing efforts in tobacco may be broadly categorized as price interventions, educational campaigns, and localized smoking bans. These three categories are interesting because they each use different mechanisms to reduce smoking. Price interventions typically involve the implementation of excise taxes that increase the economic cost of being a smoker. Educational campaigns consist of advertising that emphasizes the health consequences and risks associated with smoking. Localized smoking restrictions involve practices such as smoking bans at restaurants and campus smoking prohibitions that make smoking less convenient and increase the time cost of smoking.</p><p>Second, we investigate how countermarketing activities change patterns of consumption. The consumption patterns that are of specific interest are potential shifts to higher nicotine cigarettes. Because tobacco 56 Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 55-72, © 2016 INFORMS taxes are uniformly applied across nicotine levels, as tobacco taxes increase, consumers may shift to products that have higher nicotine content in order to lower their cost per unit of nicotine. Smoke-free restrictions might also cause smokers to switch to higher nicotine brands to alleviate the imposed inconvenience and opportunity cost of smoking (i.e., time). Higher nicotine cigarettes do not only induce stronger addiction but also contain higher tar content, which is directly linked to lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Denissenko et al. 1996)</ref>. Hence the health benefits of countermarketing strategies may be mitigated by unintended changes in consumption patterns. Furthermore, we also consider the possibility that shifts in consumption differentially affect various segments of society. In particular, we investigate whether less affluent members of society are more likely to switch to more dangerous products.</p><p>The foundational data for our empirical work is a store-level scanner data set. These data include seven years <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref> of store-level cigarette sales and marketing mix activities across a broad cross section of U.S. markets. We supplement these data with extensive information on cigarette excise tax records, smoke-free restriction levels, and antismoking advertising gross ratings points over time and markets. In addition, we collected detailed information on cigarette attributes such as variations in nicotine and tar content across brands and strength levels (regular/lights/ultra lights). Finally, although our research focuses on countermarketing tactics, we also evaluate the effectiveness of the tobacco industry's marketing activities. Countermarketing does not occur in a vacuum, so it is imperative to control for the marketing efforts of the tobacco industry when studying countermarketing effectiveness.</p><p>The data used in our research possess several characteristics that facilitate the identification of the effectiveness of the various countermarketing tactics. In our data we observe meaningful intertemporal and cross-sectional variation in antismoking policies. Cigarette excise taxes include a varying state component in addition to a common federal component. Typically, the federal tax is much smaller than the state tax and the only variation in the federal tax during the observation window from 2001 to 2007 was a five-cent increase. In contrast, taxes range considerably across states. Similarly, the majority of antismoking advertising is sponsored by each state's health and human services department. The delegation of policy decisions to the states results in significant differences across states. In addition, as tax rates, smoke-free restrictions, and state budgets for antismoking advertising campaigns are set at the state level, these variables are exogenous to local storelevel demand. Collectively the exogenous nature of the policies and the variation of levels across states facilitate the identification of the effects of the various countermarketing techniques. We also use zip code level demographics to examine whether effectiveness varies across socioeconomic groups.</p><p>Our empirical analysis involves simultaneously estimating a market-share and a category sales model as a function of pro-smoking marketing mix and the three antismoking tactics. Furthermore, the antismoking policy environment includes factors that may dynamically impact cigarette consumption. The equations are estimated using a Kalman filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Harvey 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Naik et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Naik et al. , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sriram et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhao et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Liu and Shankar 2015)</ref> with price and advertising endogeneity treated with a control function approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Petrin and Train 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We find that cigarette excise taxes are the most effective tool for reducing overall cigarette sales, followed by antismoking advertising. Smoke-free restrictions are found to have a nonsignificant effect on cigarette sales. However, cigarette excise taxes and smoke-free restrictions are both associated with the unintended consequence of leading smokers to switch to higher nicotine cigarettes to seek nicotine and time cost savings. For example, although a 10% increase in cigarette excise taxes results in a 1.6% reduction in category sales over a seven-year period, this level of tax increase also causes a 0.7% increase in the market share of regular cigarettes and a 0.9% reduction in the market share of ultra light cigarettes. Antismoking advertising is the only technique that successfully reduces category sales without shifting share to higher nicotine variants. It is interesting to note that antismoking advertising also reduces the effectiveness of pro-cigarette advertising.</p><p>To further evaluate these "unintended consequences," we decomposed the net nicotine intake changes into those due to changes in category sales and market share shifts across different nicotine level cigarettes. Our results suggest that a 10% increase in excise taxes (relative to the values observed in the data) results in an overall reduction in category sales of about 1%, but only a net decrease in nicotine consumption of 0.7%. Nicotine reduction is less than category shrinkage because there is a significant shift toward high nicotine cigarettes. This adverse effect is particularly relevant for lower socioeconomic classes. Our findings therefore suggest that uniform cigarette excise taxes should be considered with caution as these flat taxes also increase addiction levels for many smokers. Policy makers should consider the adoption of a nicotine-based tax structure.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 frames our contribution in terms of the economic, public health, and marketing literatures. We then provide background on countermarketing efforts and tobacco industry marketing. Section 3 describes the 57 data sources used in our analysis. Next, we present our modeling approach and estimation results in §4. We then use our model results to conduct a simulation study that examines how taxes simultaneously reduce category consumption while shifting consumers to higher nicotine products. We conclude with a discussion of key issues, limitations, and areas for further inquiry in §5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The literature concerned with smoking cessation spans multiple academic disciplines including economics, public health, and marketing. In this review, we begin with the economics and public health literatures that explicitly focus on the effectiveness of antismoking strategies. We then shift to marketing research concerned with tobacco marketing. Our goal in this review is not to exhaustively survey these literatures but to highlight the need for a study of the simultaneous impact of antismoking and prosmoking tactics on cigarette category sales and market shares of cigarettes with different nicotine content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Economic Literature on Antismoking</head><p>Strategies and Category Sales Antismoking organizations have employed a variety of techniques including cigarette excise taxes, smoke-free restrictions, and educational antismoking advertising campaigns. Of all of the various countermarketing instruments, cigarette taxes are often viewed as the most important countermarketing technique. Cigarette excise taxes have traditionally been specified per 20-cigarette pack and are included in posted retail prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chetty et al. 2009</ref>). These taxes typically include a federal and state component. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> During our observation window the federal tax was constant except for a five-cent increase from 34 cents to 39 cents on January 1, 2002. However, substantial variations in the state tax component are observed across states and over time. For example, in 2005 the cigarette excise tax per package varied from a low of $1.18 in Missouri to a high of $6.86 in New York City. Temporal variation is illustrated by the case of the state of Washington. Washington's cigarette tax rate was $1.17 in 2000 and had increased to $4.04 in 2011. There have been multiple studies that have examined the relationship between prices and cigarette demand. A majority of these studies have used annual or monthly state level cigarette purchases as the dependent variable and have found that the price elasticity of cigarette demand is about −0 4 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chaloupka and Warner 2000</ref> for a review).</p><p>A parallel stream of research in the economics literature has focused on usage restrictions implemented via "smoke-free air policies." The idea behind these restrictions is to increase time and effort costs by forcing smokers outdoors to smoke. Smoke-free restrictions affected approximately 50% of the population before the year 2000 and were steadily expanded to the point where over 70% of the population was affected by 2008. Smoke-free air policies have been found to have mixed results. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Evans et al. (1999)</ref> find that voluntary workplace smoke-free air laws reduce smoking prevalence by five percentage points and daily consumption by 10 percentage points. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bitler et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adda and Cornaglia (2010)</ref> find no effect of smoke-free air laws on smoking behavior.</p><p>In conjunction with these tax hikes and usage restrictions, antismoking ad campaigns have been rolled out by the states' departments of health and human services with the goals of preventing youth smoking and reducing adult smoking rates. During the period from 2001 to 2007 the majority of antismoking advertising campaigns were planned at the state level. Antismoking advertising has been found to reduce smoking rates. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu et al. (1995)</ref> found the antismoking advertising elasticity to be significant at −0 07 using data from California. Studies in the public health literature have often evaluated the effectiveness of antismoking advertising campaigns using field studies and self-reported usage measures (see NCI 2008 for a review).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Marketing Literature on Pro-Smoking</head><p>Strategies, Market Shares, and Category Sales The extant economic literature on smoking has largely ignored the interactions between antismoking and pro-smoking marketing strategies. This is a significant omission as it is imperative to control for the marketing efforts of the tobacco industry when studying countermarketing effectiveness. Although cigarette advertising is restricted to newspapers and magazines with target audiences above the age of 18, recent research indicates that even minimal exposure to advertising (100 milliseconds) can be effective. Research from marketing studies supports the premise that cigarette brand advertising is very effective. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pollay et al. (1996)</ref> found cigarette advertising elasticity with regard to brand shares to be 0.28. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Leeflang and Reuijl (1985)</ref> provide evidence that cigarette advertising also significantly expands category sales. Several marketing studies also provide lab-based experimental evidence on the relationship between ad content (i.e., peer effects) and ad effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pechmann and Knight 2002)</ref>. This experimental literature has tended to focus on adolescent smoking with self-reported intention  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pechmann and Shih 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Pechmann et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Andrews et al. 2004</ref>.</p><p>The marketing literature also includes two studies that utilize scanner data. These papers involve dynamic models of purchase and inventory decisions and are focused on the impact of temporary versus permanent price adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gordon and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun 2015, Chen et al. 2009</ref>). Chen et al. ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) build a dynamic structural brand choice model to investigate the effect of Marlboro's one-time permanent price cut in 1993 on smokers' brand switching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gordon and Sun (2015)</ref> also use a dynamic structural model to investigate the impact of tobacco companies' temporary versus permanent price adjustments on cigarette consumption. Although these studies illustrate the roles of pricing and promotion on brand tier choice and incidence, these studies do not consider the role of all three countermarketing activities or switching between nicotine-based subcategories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Antismoking Strategies and Market Shares</head><p>Few studies investigate whether and how antismoking activities change the patterns of consumption across cigarette types. For instance, there is an open question as to whether cigarette taxes, smoke-free restrictions, and antismoking advertising lead to market share shifts toward higher nicotine content cigarettes. Studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adda and Cornaglia (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans and Farrelly (1998)</ref> do partially address the issue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adda and Cornaglia (2006)</ref> investigate whether smokers extract more nicotine per cigarette by varying the number of puffs. Using a biomarker measure of cotinine concentration in saliva, they find that tax hikes induce nicotine intake compensating behavior. Evans and Farrelly (1998) supplement selfreported cigarette brand purchases in the National Health Interview Survey with state tax data, and find that smokers in high-tax states are more likely to smoke higher nicotine cigarettes than those in lowtax states. Given the cross-sectional nature of the two waves of surveys in 1979 and 1987, their results are subject to survival bias since smokers who prefer high nicotine cigarettes may be more or less likely to be left in the population. Apart from the aforementioned studies, there is no evidence on how the present practice of uniform cigarette excise taxes may lead smokers to switch to higher nicotine content brands to obtain nicotine per dollar cost savings. In addition, it is unknown whether smoke-free restrictions may switch smokers to higher nicotine brands to alleviate the imposed inconvenience and opportunity cost of smoking (i.e., time), or whether health-warning messages carried in antismoking advertising may switch smokers toward lighter brands. Our study attempts to fill this gap by examining the full consequences of antismoking tactics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Summary and Outstanding Issues</head><p>The preceding discussion highlights a lack of empirical research that simultaneously considers the impact of antismoking and pro-smoking strategies on both category sales and market shares of cigarettes with different nicotine contents. For example, the use of cigarette taxes that are independent of nicotine content may have unintended effects on consumer's choices. Although the taxes themselves may reduce consumption, the possibility exists that consumers might switch to higher nicotine brands in order to lower the cost per unit of nicotine. Similarly, educational advertising and usage restrictions may also have multidimensional effects on consumer behavior. There is a need for studies that consider the unintended consequences of antismoking policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data</head><p>The cigarette category has been a source of controversy for at least the past half century. Cigarette marketing has been regulated, restrictions that limit distribution and public consumption have been imposed, governments have levied taxes, and public health organizations have conducted educational campaigns. Simultaneously, cigarette companies have developed strong brands, and used a variety of pricing and promotional strategies. The complexity of this environment presents several challenges for analyses of consumer behavior. To address our research questions, it is necessary to assemble and combine multiple data sets. The data sources include a sevenyear U.S. store-level cigarette sales data set covering January 2001 to December 2007, cigarette excise tax records, smoke-free policies, antismoking advertising, cigarette brand advertising, and cigarette attributes such as nicotine and tar content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Scanner Store Data</head><p>Our data source for cigarette sales is a comprehensive scanner data panel provided by IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bronnenberg et al. 2008)</ref>. The data spans seven years from 2001 to 2007 and covers a large cross section of markets across the United States. The units of analysis are overall category sales and the market shares of regular, light, and ultra light cigarettes at each retail store. Because Marlboro is a clear market leader, we add in a brand component and focus on seven cigarette products including Marlboro regular, Marlboro lights, Marlboro ultra lights, other regular, other lights, other ultra lights, and other mild. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We restricted the analyses to 645 stores with complete seven-year records. These stores span 38 states, 52 designated media areas (DMAs), 196 counties, and 592 zip codes.</p><p>The store-level scanner data records detailed information on weekly volumes, dollars, and promotional activities at the universal product code (UPC) level. We use three steps to recover the tax-exclusive cigarette shelf (regular) price per pack. First, we calculate the regular cigarette price per pack as dollars divided by packs for each stock keeping unit (SKU), and tax-exclusive cigarette price per pack as cigarette price per pack minus tax per pack. Second, we identify and remove cigarette prices when (i) there is missing dollars or volume information; (ii) there is a feature, display, and/or price reduction in that week; (iii) the prices are outliers in the top and bottom 1%. We then estimate the taxexclusive cigarette price per pack for the removed store/week/SKU as the most recent tax-exclusive cigarette price per pack within the eight weeks before and afterward <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham and Lodish 1993)</ref>. The taxexclusive brand price is an SKU-share weighted average. A brand is said to be on promotion if any of its SKUs are on feature, display, or temporary price reduction.</p><p>As we are interested in how antismoking policies may lead to potential shifts to higher nicotine products, we collected attribute information on nicotine content from Federal Trade Commission Reports. The annual reports provide machine-tested nicotine content of sampled SKUs with various design features (e.g., flavors, filters, menthols, and lengths) from major cigarette brands. We matched the nicotine content per cigarette to every cigarette SKU in the IRI data by brand, year, and the four attributes of flavors, filters, menthols, and lengths. An SKU-share weighted average is used to measure brand nicotine content as milligrams of nicotine content per cigarette.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides descriptive statistics for the seven cigarette products' marketing mixes. The three Marlboro products account for more than 40% market share. It is important to note that cigarette prices within a brand are constant across products with  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Model-Free Analyses</head><p>Before introducing the formal model, we present several model-free analyses of countermarketing tactics on cigarette consumption. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 and 2</ref> we plot the geographical and temporal distributions of cigarette excise taxes, smoke-free restriction levels, and antismoking advertising ratings. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) plots a three-month moving average of cigarette category sales in a typical store. The figure shows a significant declining pattern, which is consistent with the growing popularity of cigarette excise taxes, smokefree restrictions, and antismoking ad campaigns. Our first objective is to examine cross-sectional evidence on the relationship between countermarketing strategies and category sales and cigarette market  shares. As noted, the three antismoking countermarketing strategies are all planned at the state level. As a result, we have quasi-experiment data from retail stores across various states. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b) compares the monthly category volumes across stores based on tax quartiles. It shows that category sales in the hightax stores are about half that of the low-tax stores. Similarly, the cross-sectional variation facilitates the identification of how the three countermarketing tactics may induce potential shifts to cigarette products with higher nicotine contents. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(a), we compare market shares of regular, light, and ultra light cigarettes across stores based on tax quartiles.</p><p>The figure shows that the market share of regular cigarettes in high-tax stores is 12% larger than that in low-tax stores, whereas the market share of ultra light cigarettes in high-tax stores is 16% smaller than that in low-tax stores.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N q N</formula><p>Note. The correlation between regular cigarette and median income is −0 49 (p-value &lt; 0 05).</p><p>per-nicotine economic costs and smoking-associated opportunity costs (time). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>(d) we show the correlations between market shares of regular, light, and ultra light cigarettes and the median household income in a store's zip code. Previous literature has noted that smoking rates in the United States are significantly higher among lower socioeconomic status households (CDC 2011). Interestingly, we find that smokers with relatively lower socioeconomic status purchase a substantially higher proportion of regular cigarettes than smokers of higher socioeconomic status (43% versus 32% in the top and bottom quartile of household median income).</p><p>Next, we take a difference-in-difference approach to explore the reaction to within-state tax variations. As a benchmark, California (CA) went through no (state) tax hikes during our observation window. Its tax rate was set at $1.20. We also notice that four states, Massachusetts (MA), Maryland (MD), Michigan (MI), and New Jersey (NJ), that had about the same tax level as California at the beginning of our observation period in 2001, all increased cigarette taxes in July 2002. This creates a quasi-field experiment setting such that there are 118 stores in the control group in California and 108 stores in the other four states (see details in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>). We look at the category volumes and market shares 12-months before and after the tax hike. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> reports the difference-in-difference regression results of category volumes as a function of cigarette excise taxes. Both the intercept and the coefficient associated with tax differences are significantly negative (p &lt; 0 001). This suggests that the four states in the treatment conditions had a larger reduction in cigarette volumes than the control group in California, and that the larger the tax hikes, the more the reduction in category volume.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Econometric Analysis</head><p>In this section we use our insights from the preceding model-free analyses to specify our model. The model focuses on two dependent variables: market shares of cigarettes of different nicotine contents and category sales. It serves two purposes. First, it allows us to assess the extent to which countermarketing strategies can change cigarette category sales and/or affect market shares of different nicotine content cigarettes. Second, it lets us decompose overall nicotine intake changes into changes due to category sales and shifts in market shares of cigarettes of different nicotine contents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Setup</head><p>We employ an attraction model wherein a product's market share is equal to its attraction relative to all others. More formally, the market share MS jst for product j = 1 2 7 in month t at a store s is given by MS jst = A jst / k A kst , where A jst is the attraction of product j in month t in store s. The formulation is similar in spirit to research in marketing that satisfies the logical-consistency requirements of market share models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cooper and Nakanishi 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Naik et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Naik et al. , 2005</ref>. We specify attraction as A jst = exp H jst + X 1jst + jst , where H jst indicates the time-varying attractiveness intercept of cigarette product j in month t at store s. Variables X 1jst includes product j's tax-exclusive cigarette price per pack P jst , promotion dummy Pr jst , and nicotine content Nico jst .

For example, a positive coefficient 1s suggests that preference for higher nicotine content cigarettes gets stronger as cigarette excise taxes increase, and vice versa. The interpretation of 2s and 3s is similar. Furthermore, we allow the parameters to differ across socioeconomic status as s = + × I s income_q1 = 1 , where I s income_q1 is an indicator for stores in the bottom quartile of median household income.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Model Comparisons</head><p>In this section we compare several alternative model specifications and present the estimation results of our proposed model. Model 1 is structured so that only marketing variables impact market shares and only antismoking policies influence category sales. Model 2 adds marketing variables to the category equation. Model 3 allows antismoking policies to affect market shares. Model 4 includes an interaction between antismoking and pro-smoking variables in both market share and category sales. Model 5 adds monthly dummies to both market shares and category sales. Model 6 allows for separate carryover rates for market shares and category sales. As mentioned previously, the factor analysis of the smoke-free regulations reveals two factors, one aimed at adults and the other related to efforts to create a smoke-free environment for children. Model 6 suggests that the childrentargeted smoke-free restriction is nonsignificant in either market shares or category sales. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> In model 7 we test a parsimonious model that only includes the adult-targeted smoke-free restriction levels.  parameters of each model. To compare models, we use the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) metrics. Model 7 is superior to all of the other models. This result suggests that both antismoking and pro-smoking marketing strategies play a role in driving total cigarette category sales and market shares of different nicotine cigarettes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> visually demonstrates a model fit for both category sales and market shares.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Antismoking Policies on</head><p>Cigarettes' Market Shares. We first discuss the estimates for the antismoking instruments on the market shares of cigarettes with different nicotine contents (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref>). We find that the interaction between cigarette excise taxes and a product's nicotine content is significantly positive. This implies that an increase in cigarette excise taxes will lead to greater preferences for higher nicotine content cigarettes. Furthermore, the taxinduced nicotine compensating pattern is significantly more salient for stores located in the bottom quartile of median household income. These results confirm our speculation that the current uniform cigarette excise taxes leads smokers to switch to higher nicotine cigarettes to seek nicotine cost savings. This effect is more pronounced for low income smokers.</p><p>Regarding smoke-free restrictions, we find that an increase in the level of smoke-free restrictions leads to significantly greater preferences for higher nicotine content cigarettes as well. This result supports our speculation that smoke-free restrictions lead to a shift in preferences toward higher nicotine cigarettes to alleviate the imposed inconvenience and opportunity cost of smoking (i.e., time). However, the interaction is significantly weaker for stores in the bottom quartile of median household income.</p><p>When it comes to antismoking advertising, we find no significant role for antismoking advertising in altering the market shares of cigarettes of different nicotine contents. However, antismoking advertising does have a significant effect of mitigating the cigarette advertising by tobacco companies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Elasticity</head><p>The relative effectiveness of the three countermarketing tactics is best illustrated through a comparison of elasticities. For the specification in the attraction model of market shares, the expressions for elasticity are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">× 1 − MS × Tax × 1 − n / 1 − for cigarette excise taxes, × 1 − MS × SF × 1 − n / 1 −</formula><p>for smoke-free restrictions, and × 1 − MS × 1 − n / 1 − for antismoking advertising. The elasticity of category sales is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">× 1 − n / 1 − for cigarette excise taxes, × SF × 1 − n / 1 −</formula><p>for smoke-free restrictions, and × 1 − n / 1 − for antismoking advertising (see Web Appendix F). In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">7</ref>, we report the elasticity of response to the three antismoking policies for a   seven-year time period. Cigarette excise taxes are significantly more effective than antismoking advertising in reducing overall cigarette sales (elasticity of −0 162 and −0 104, respectively). Smoke-free restrictions are not found to reduce cigarette sales. However, cigarette excise taxes and smoke-free restrictions are both associated with the unintended consequences of leading smokers to switch to higher nicotine cigarettes to seek nicotine and time cost savings. For example, over a seven-year period a 10% increase in cigarette excise taxes (relative to the tax levels in our data) results in a 1.6% reduction in category sales. Although this is a positive public health outcome, the tax increase also leads to a 0.7% increase in the market share of regular cigarettes and a 0.9% reduction in the market share of ultra light cigarettes. A 10% increase in smoke-free restrictions results in approximately a 0.1% increase in market share of regular cigarettes and 0.2% reduction in market share of ultra light cigarettes. Antismoking advertising is the only technique that successfully decreases category sales reduction without shifting market share toward high nicotine cigarettes. Over a seven-year period a 10% increase in antismoking advertising will lead to a 1% reduction in category sales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Policy Simulations</head><p>Because nicotine is the major addictive agent in cigarettes, the diverse effects of the antismoking policies on category sales and market shares raise  important questions. What is the effect of the three antismoking policies on overall nicotine intake and how does the reduction in nicotine consumption from category shrinkage compare to the increase due to brand switching? To answer these questions, we performed a series of simulations.</p><p>We first computed the level of nicotine intake (measure 1) for some level of antismoking policies observed in the data over the entire seven-year period. We then computed category sales, market shares, and the corresponding level of nicotine intake (measure 2) for an alternative antismoking policy. The difference (diff 1) is the net effect of the antismoking policy on nicotine intake. Next, we calculated another level of nicotine intake (measure 3) under an assumption that the antismoking policy only had an effect on category sales but not market shares. The difference (diff 2) between measures 1 and 3 is the nicotine intake change due to category sales reduction. The difference between diff 1 and diff 2 is a measure of the extra nicotine intake that can be attributed to market share shifts to high nicotine cigarettes. A positive value of this measure implies an unintended nicotine compensation effect.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>, we show the decomposition of nicotine consumption changes. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref>, we show the decomposition for the bottom quartile of median household income. During a seven-year period, when there is a 10% increase in cigarette excise taxes, the overall category shrinks by 1.06%. However, the net  Note. 95% confidence interval in parentheses.</p><p>impact of the tax hike on nicotine intake is just 0.76% because it is mitigated by the shift toward high nicotine cigarettes (which drives a 0.30% increase in nicotine consumption). In addition, lower income smokers are more sensitive to cigarette excise taxes and also more likely to engage in tax-induced nicotine compensating. We find that a 10% increase in cigarette excise taxes leads to a larger reduction in category sales (−1 97%) for this subgroup. However, this segment also exhibits a larger unintended shift (0.54%) toward high nicotine cigarettes. Hence we find a net effect of a 1.43% nicotine intake reduction for the bottom income quartile.</p><p>As we described before, tar content and nicotine content are highly correlated. In Web Appendix G, we conducted the same evaluation using tar intake as the metric. The results show that market share shifts toward high nicotine content also significantly mitigates the health benefits of cigarette excise taxes created by category sales reductions. Given that tar content is directly linked to lung cancer, this finding has important public health implications.</p><p>Since antismoking advertising does not drive market shares, over a seven-year period a 10% increase in antismoking advertising leads to a 1.48% net reduction in nicotine intake based entirely on lower category sales. The effect of smoke-free restrictions on nicotine intake is not significant. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Our results reveal the overall benefits of antismoking advertising and highlight a potential downside associated with cigarette excise taxes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Over the last several decades, there has been a concerted effort by government and nonprofit organizations to reduce cigarette consumption. These organizations have used a variety of methods such as tax hikes, smoking restrictions, and educational campaigns that can collectively be classified as countermarketing. Given that these organizations have limited resources and lobbying power, a critical issue in public health is determining the relative effectiveness of these different countermarketing tools. Furthermore, the general issue of countermarketing effectiveness is growing in importance as governments and public health organizations have begun to target other categories such as soda and fast food.</p><p>Of the three countermarketing strategies evaluated in our study, cigarette excise taxes are found to be the most effective in reducing cigarette category sales, followed by antismoking advertising. We find that smoke-free restrictions are ineffective in reducing overall cigarette demand. However, cigarette excise taxes and smoke-free restrictions are both associated with an unfortunate consequence of causing smokers to switch to higher nicotine cigarettes to seek nicotine and time cost savings. This dangerous side effect occurs because a uniform cigarette tax provides an incentive for consumers, particularly in lower income brackets, to minimize their price per unit of nicotine. The health benefits of a tax-based countermarketing strategy may therefore be mitigated by the substitution of higher nicotine and higher tar cigarette brands by some consumers. Our results and policy experiments suggest that a cigarette tax that varies based on nicotine levels would be more effective in delivering health benefits.</p><p>Critically, given that we do not see a drop in category consumption associated with smoke-free restrictions but do observe that these policies shift consumption toward more dangerous products, smoke free policies seem particularly problematic. However, it is important to recognize that smoke-free restrictions are also intended to alleviate the negative effects associated with second-hand smoking. Antismoking advertising on the other hand, is the only technique found to successfully reduce category sales without shifting demand toward higher nicotine cigarettes. It is also worth highlighting the interaction between antismoking and pro-smoking advertising campaigns. Apart from its main effect in reducing cigarette category sales, we find that antismoking advertising is also effective in reducing the effectiveness of pro-smoking advertising on total cigarette Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 55-72, © 2016 INFORMS market expansion. Hence, educational antismoking campaigns deserve an increased emphasis.</p><p>It is also important to note that the coefficient associated with cigarette advertising on category sales is significant and positive. This is not a trivial finding. A key argument used by the tobacco industry in defense testimony has been that tobacco advertising does not expand markets but focuses on gaining market share. Our results provide evidence to counter these assertions.</p><p>There are several limitations of the paper that deserve mention. First, as in any empirical analysis, we are limited by the data available. Although we have detailed point of sale data on quantity, price, and promotions, our advertising variables (both pro and anti) are observed at an aggregate level. Even within the point of sale (POS) scanner data, our database does not include sales from gas stations that account for slightly larger volumes of tobacco sales than supermarkets (37% versus 36%, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tauras et al. 2006)</ref>. Second, large tax increases in certain states/cities (e.g., New York) have created black market activities that our analysis does not account for. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> There are several other countermarketing tactics (e.g., dramatic images or messages on cigarette packs) that our analysis does not consider.</p><p>The topic of our analysis may also be studied using alternative data sources and modeling methodologies. For example, cigarette consumption features addiction and self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gordon and Sun 2015)</ref>. These behavioral traits suggest an opportunity to study consumer response to countermarketing and cessation at the individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wang et al. 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, use of structural models of smoker response to cigarettes can allow evaluation of how consumers respond to long-term price changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gordon and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun 2015, Chen et al. 2009)</ref> or how brand strength moderates the impact of countermarketing at the level of the individual smoker <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wang et al. 2014</ref>). Such individual level models that can capture the dynamic structure of consumer decision making are of significant value and complement the current study, which relies on aggregate data. An obvious trade-off is that unlike the current paper, the papers mentioned above rely on purchase data from small samples of consumer panelists, short time frames, and usually single markets with limited exogenous variation in tax policies.</p><p>Finally, the analysis presented in the paper is also important because such antitobacco programs are increasingly used as models for newer efforts to improve public health. For example, there is currently a great deal of interest in antiobesity programs. These programs have been justified using similar arguments regarding medical costs, as the estimated annual medical costs due to obesity exceed $150 billion. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Similar to antitobacco campaigns, antiobesity organizations have advocated for taxes on high fat products, 12 educational campaigns, and efforts to ban products such as large sizes of sugary beverages. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The extension of countermarketing efforts to these less controversial categories also highlights the need for firms to investigate the proper marketing response to countermarketing tactics. Fast food companies and soft drink manufacturers may benefit from further research into the ideal responses to countermarketing activities.</p></div>

Philip Morris and Lorillard, is allowed on television and radio. In Table1, we report the combined brand and corporate advertising expenditures in thousands of dollars at the monthly DMA level.3.3. Countermarketing StrategiesWe supplement the store category sales and market shares with data on three countermarketing strategies. The data are collected from several sources and include cigarette excise taxes, smoke-free restrictions, and antismoking advertising rating points. Cigarette excise taxes are obtained from the Tax Burden on Tobacco report that provides detailed information on federal, state, and local tax rates and effective dates. To quantify smoke-free restrictions, we collect CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reported annual smoke-free restriction levels for each state. The CDC categorizes smoking restrictions on a zero to five scale (whole numbers) for 12 common areas including government worksites, private worksites, restaurants, healthcare facilities, public transportation, shopping Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 55-72, © 2016 INFORMS malls, bars, recreational facilities, cultural facilities, public schools, private schools, and child care centers. We conducted a principal component analysis using the ratings on the 12 areas and extracted the first principal component (see Appendix A) for use in subsequent modeling. To measure antismoking advertising, we obtained antismoking advertising gross rating points from A.C. Nielsen. The monthly DMA-level gross rating points measure all televised antismoking advertisements produced by each state's department of health.Store zip codes are used to match the countermarketing information. For antismoking advertising, we first match each store to a specific DMA based on county according to Nielsen's DMA map. Based on the DMA we then determine the exposure to antismoking gross rating points.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Note that we assume common parameters for the main effects of the antismoking policies across products in the market share Equation (1). As a result, after applying a log-centering transformation of Equation (1), the main effects of the policy variables that are common across products drop out of the attraction model.4  Note that H * jst is arithmetic mean centered. Therefore, the productvarying attributes enter as Nico * jst = Nico jst −Nico st , where Nico st is the arithmetic mean; log Ads * jst = log Ads jst / Ads st , where Ads st is the geometric mean.</note>
