<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Any marketing modeler who wants to use real data to test a model might have difficulties finding reliable, representative data sources. Information systems and computer science researchers who develop and evaluate text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to discover marketing intelligence from product reviews require representative sets of consumer-generated reviews. An emergent product (e.g., tablet computer) manufacturer that needs timely reports about competitors' consumers to improve and enhance the next version of its flagship product similarly must be able to identify ineffective strategies, without conducting time-consuming surveys.</p><p>In response to these demands and to encourage the use of user-generated content (UGC), we offer a tablet computer data set that contains product and review data collected from Amazon.com and manufacturers. It provides market dynamics describing 2,163 products (collected over a 24-week period in early 2012), characteristics of 794 products, more than 40,000 consumer-generated product reviews, and information about 39,278 reviewers. This data set can help academic researchers and practitioners understand the impact and value of digital data that are readily available online, as well as support the application of advanced data and text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze UGC. Researchers can use this data set to conduct relevant research on product reviews, pricing, competition, new product development, and text analytics, for example. The method used to build the data set demonstrates not only that UGC is a viable external data source but also that this new data collection and integration approach can support research when reliable data are missing or cannot be easily obtained.</p><p>The use of structured data is common in mature marketing research, but because of the sheer volume and unstructured nature of market dynamics and UGC available on various websites, their use remains underdeveloped. For example, online product reviews contributed by consumers tend to be qualitative, which makes it challenging to quantify and convert the textual data into usable information. In the recent Marketing Science special issue on the emergence and impact of UGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fader and Winer 2012)</ref>, two 450 Marketing Science 33(3), pp. 449-458, © 2014 INFORMS separate contributions suggest new methodologies for analyzing UGC and thus discovering insightful marketing information. The ranking system implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ghose et al. (2012)</ref> incorporates UGC directly into existing forms of product/service rankings, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Netzer et al. (2012)</ref> demonstrate that UGC can provide information about competitive market structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee and Bradlow (2011)</ref> have pioneered the integration of marketing and information systems disciplines through the use of UGC. They propose that text mining of online reviews might help automate the process of identifying the language that consumers use to describe products. Considering the opportunities to explore this external data source, we argue that potential collaborations among marketing scientists, computer scientists, and information systems researchers could facilitate its dissemination to marketing research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Das and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen 2007, Lee and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bradlow 2011)</ref>. Researchers thus could examine questions that have remained unanswered because of the lack of reliable and representative data. For example, an upcoming Marketing Science special issue on big data 1 seeks to promote research on big data analytics.</p><p>We present the structure and analysis of our Tablet Computer data set in §2. To illustrate the data set's significant, unique content, we include a list of figures and tables with summary statistics. In §3, we elaborate on three research opportunities available with this data set, and then we describe how to access and use it in §4. Section 5 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Tablet Computer Data Set</head><p>Existing research focuses on reviews of products such as digital cameras, movies, and smartphones; no data set comprises consumer-generated reviews of tablet computers. However, advances in information technology make tablet computers a prominent product category. A tablet is a one-piece mobile computer. Devices typically have a touch screen, with finger or stylus gestures replacing the conventional computer mouse. It is often supplemented by physical buttons or input from sensors such as accelerometers. According to a tablet buying guide published by Consumer Reports, tablets' main product attributes include their screen size and shape, wireless connectivity, display, operating systems, ports, and printing capability. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Apple released its first iPad on April 3, 2010, which quickly became the first mobile tablet to achieve worldwide commercial success. In 2012, 31% of U.S. Internet users owned a tablet computer, up from 12% in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Moscaritolo 2012)</ref>. The International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Smart Connected Device Tracker expects tablet shipments to surpass total PC shipments (desktop plus portable PCs) in the fourth quarter of 2013 and annually by 2015. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Among tablets available in 2012, the top-selling line of devices was Apple's iPad, with close 100 million sold by mid-October 2012; Amazon's Kindle Fire followed with 7 million, then Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook with 5 million and the Google Nexus 7 with 3 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen 2012)</ref>. To reach wider audiences, more than 70% of mobile developers were targeting tablets in <ref type="bibr">May 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">(Developer Economics 2013</ref>. According to Bloomberg News <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kharif 2011)</ref>, "On a single day in July, almost 18,000 fakes and clones resembling the iPad and Android devices were available for sale on 23 e-commerce sites." During the period we built this data set, more than 400 brands were listed under the tablet and tablet PCs category on Amazonthough that count includes a few miscategorized devices. The integration of consumer-generated product reviews with market dynamics related to this emerging product category can thus provide marketing researchers and practitioners with a valuable data source for answering interesting marketing questions.</p><p>In support of that objective, we collected data from the largest online retailer, Amazon, and tablet computer manufacturers. Based on the data we obtained, we were able to create the following four tables that make up our data set: the Market Dynamics of Products, Product Characteristic Information, Consumer-Generated Product Reviews, and Reviewer Information tables. Combined, the four tables offer three unique properties. First, they contain both structured product information and unstructured product reviews. Second, the data set comprises product characteristic information and market dynamic information. Third, the data set integrates UGC with manufacturer-provided content available on the Internet.</p><p>Compared with data sets of consumer-generated product reviews in prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee and Bradlow 2011)</ref>, our offering provides at least four valuable contributions. First, it contains information about a prominent, emerging product category that has not been investigated previously. Second, the data set represents multiple, publicly accessible sources; it was built through data collection, cleaning, filtering, and integration processes, rather than just the simple, straightforward crawling. Third, it provides a large volume of consumer-generated product reviews (more than 40,000). Fourth, these product reviews are time-oriented, with the submission date specified. Therefore, this valuable data set can inform a range of marketing research issues, such as the price dispersion in electronic markets, the multiple factors that affect overall sales (e.g., valences, volumes), and automated market structure analyses with text mining and sentiment analysis of product reviews. We elaborate on such research opportunities in §3.</p><p>Amazon features the tablets and tablet PCs category under its electronics and computers departments. A Java Web crawler obtained market dynamic information and product reviews from this category once weekly during February 1 through July 11, 2012. In addition, we manually searched the Internet and compiled manufacturer-provided product information about 794 tablet computers that prompted at least one review. The Tablet Computer data set thus offers two tables that organize product characteristic information and market dynamic information, respectively. We present detailed descriptions of the variables in our tables in §2.1 and then include the summary statistics of the data set in §2.2 to illustrate its significant and unique content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Variable Descriptions</head><p>The variables related to the basic product and market dynamic information for 2,163 tablet computers, described in panel A of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, are organized according to the classical marketing mix concept of the four P's <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McCarthy 1960)</ref>. For this study, "place" refers to the Internet platform, Amazon.com. The Web crawler gathered 11 variables related to "price" and "promotion" once weekly for the 24 weeks through Amazon's Web service, which provides programmatic access to product information. Unlike traditional marketplace settings that provide only retail suggested and promotion prices, our data set reveals information about six price variables. List_price is the retail price suggested by the manufacturer; Amazon_price stands for the Marketing Science 33(3), pp. 449-458, © 2014 INFORMS current selling price of the focal product provided by Amazon. Compared with other electronic retailers, Amazon is not only the largest but also one of the few that offers an online marketplace as a channel for thousands of merchants to sell their own products. The variables Lowest_new_price, Lowest_used_price, and Lowest_refurbished_price reflect the lowest prices listed across all merchants for new, used, and refurbished products, respectively. Trade-in_price is the trade-in price for used products at Amazon.</p><p>Promotion refers to the communication method marketers use to provide information to different parties about their products, including advertising, public relations, personal selling, and sales promotion. For each product and across merchants, we categorize the total number of merchants selling new, used, and refurbished versions, as well as the sales rank. For example, each price variable has 24 values (i.e., each value contains the price in one particular week), so the maximal number of longitudinal observations of tablet computers is 571,032 (11 × 24 × 2 163). However, the 11 longitudinal variables may not feature price data for all 24 weeks; data might be missing for the period before the product entered the market or if it was removed from the category before the end of the data collection period. A missing Amazon_price value indicates that Amazon does not sell the focal product.</p><p>We organize Item_ID, Date_first_available, and 12 product characteristic variables (i.e., product attributes) provided by manufacturers in panel B of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. In addition to Screen_size, Wireless_type, Screen_resolution, and Operating_system, which we gathered according to the buying guide published by Consumer Reports, we collected 3G, RAM, Processor, Processor_brand, Storage_size, Average_battery_life, Item_weight, and Rear_webcam_resolution.</p><p>These characteristics of 794 products with at least one review submitted were collected manually and compiled in the Product Characteristic Information table. The third column of panel B shows examples of the various attribute levels. Each product characteristic variable features a list of levels (product attribute values). For example, regarding the Screen_size, Apple iPad offers a unique size (one attribute level) of 9.7 inches, but the Samsung Galaxy has three different sizes (three attribute levels: 7 inches, 8.9 inches, and 10.1 inches).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> consists of 12 variables to describe 40,741 consumer-generated reviews collected from Amazon. Each row of the Consumer-Generated Product Reviews table corresponds to a consumergenerated review of a particular tablet computer. Each review has eight basic variables: (1) Review_ID;  </p><p>Rating, which is out of a total of 5. Two binary variables, Real_name and Verified_purchase, indicate whether the reviewer used his or her real name and made a purchase on Amazon, respectively. Two additional variables, Total_votes and Helpful_votes, contain information about the helpfulness and social impact of the reviews. We collected these two variables weekly for 24 weeks; they were provided by reviewers who can vote as to whether each review has been helpful.</p><p>To conduct research with both product information and consumer-generated reviews, researchers can link the textual reviews in the Consumer-Generated Product Reviews table to the product information in both the Market Dynamics of Products and Product Characteristic Information tables using the Item_ID. Furthermore, Amazon clusters certain product models from the same product line as a group and consolidates all reviews for product groups on the same Web page. For example, the reviews for two Acer Iconia A510 models, which differ only in their color (silver and black), are consolidated on the same product page. In Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, these two models are listed as different products, but a review written for one model should affect potential buyers for another model as well. Therefore, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, in addition to Item_ID, we provide Base_item_ID to indicate the default model for the product line (e.g., for the Acer Iconia A510, the Base_item_ID is the Item_ID of the silver model).</p><p>Finally, characteristic information about 39,278 reviewers who submitted tablet computer reviews is presented in the Reviewer Information table of this data set. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> provides the descriptions of six variables of reviewer information. Variables such as Reviewer_ranking and Total_helpful_votes reflect Table <ref type="table">3</ref> Reviewer Characteristics</p></div>

Also, 40% of the reviewers provided their location information. The last variable, Recent_ratings, contains reviewers' 10 most recent ratings. To conduct research that combines consumer-generated reviews with the reviewers' own characteristic information, researchers can link the Consumer-Generated Product Reviews table with the Reviewer Information table using Reviewer_ID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Analyses and Summary Statistics</head><p>To demonstrate the significant and unique content of the Tablet Computer data set, we conducted data analyses with descriptive statistics. We chose the top eight tablet computers in terms of the number of reviews, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. However, we excluded the Kindle Fire, because Amazon is its dominant sales channel, so this product accounts for an overwhelming number of reviews on the site (46% of total reviews), which would distort the scale of the graphs. Two major competitors, the Apple iPad series and Samsung Galaxy, prompt fewer reviews and are not included in the top eight products list, so consumers apparently use other channels to purchase and provide comments (e.g., Apple's stores and website should be the dominant sales channels for the iPad series).</p><p>For the product information as described in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, we provide descriptive statistics for the price and  promotion variables in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5 and 6</ref>, respectively. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, except for List_price (i.e., the retail price suggested by manufacturers), which is almost stable, considerable price variations occur across price variables. Amazon_price is usually lower than List_price, with the exception of the TouchPad. For this product, the manufacturer put it on "fire sale" and heavily discounted the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deneckere et al. 1997)</ref>, to the point that retailers ran out of stock quickly, and many consumers were willing to pay more than MSRP. This example reveals the imbalance between the supply and demand sides. Prices provided by individual merchants who sell new, used, and refurbished products are usually lower than the Amazon_price. Using Amazon_price, the current selling price of the product by Amazon, and Lowest_used_price, the lowest selling price for used products provided by third-party merchants, we plot the top eight products' prices across 24 weeks in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. A discontinuity occurs for products that are out of stock for a specific week or that are no longer being manufactured. However, for a few   price variables such as List_price, no such discontinuity arises, because all prices are available throughout the data collection period. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> shows the descriptive statistics for the total number of merchants selling new, used, and refurbished products. Across these three categories, used products are sold by the most merchants, whereas refurbished products have the fewest merchants. In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we plot the total accumulated reviews for these eight products throughout the 24-week observation period. The first week captures the number of all prior reviews. For the structured review information as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we first provide the descriptive statistics, such as Rating, Real_name, and Verified_purchase. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> we present the distribution of review ratings, based on their numerical star ratings. A fivestar rating describes a high proportion of all eight products. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> uses two binary variables, Real_name and Verified_purchase, to indicate the percentages with which reviewers used their real names when submitting reviews and whether a purchase was made on Amazon. Most reviewers do not use their real names, but a high proportion of them make their purchases through Amazon.</p><p>To demonstrate the rich content of the qualitative product reviews, we provide the descriptive statistics for 40,741 consumer-generated reviews in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>, which offers researchers a unique opportunity to investigate the use of online product reviews. These reviews refer to 794 tablet computers. Most reviewers contribute only a single review (i.e., 40,741 reviews submitted by 39,278 reviewers). Each of the 794 tablet computers attracted an average of 51.3 reviews, each  of which contained 11.5 sentences with 207.8 words and punctuation marks, on average. About two-thirds of the rating votes were positive <ref type="bibr">(214,653 of 326,507)</ref>. Because tablets are a prominent electronics product category, these statistics exemplify the rich content of online consumer-generated reviews, which can be used to answer interesting marketing questions. We conducted a simple text analysis of the 40,741 reviews, for which we extracted noun phases that contain up to two words, then ranked them according to frequencies. Table <ref type="table">9</ref> lists the top 60 noun phrases. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> depicts these phrases as a tag cloud, highlighting those with higher frequencies by using larger fonts. For example, "tablet," "ipad," "kindle fire," and "device" emerged as the top four noun phrases in tablet reviews. Tablet computers' product features, such as "apps," "battery," "screen," "book," "video," "movie," "wifi," and "game," were also frequently mentioned. These noun phrases reflect consumers' opinions and preference measures in relation to tablet computers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Opportunities</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Price Dispersion in Electronic Markets</head><p>The Tablet Computer data set contains six price variables, which provide a unique opportunity to address a stream of research questions regarding electronic price dispersion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakos (1997)</ref> first predicted that electronic markets would be more efficient and frictionfree than traditional markets; since then, because of the reduced search costs associated with matching buyers and sellers, a growing body of research has examined the factors that cause price dispersions in electronic markets. Some notable factors include product and service bundling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baye et al. 2004)</ref>; differences in brand, reputation, and trust across merchants <ref type="bibr">(Baye et al. 2006, Brynjolfsson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Smith 2000)</ref>; product heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baye et al. 2006</ref>); price discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clemons et al. 2002)</ref>; and randomized pricing strategies by firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ghose et al. 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ghose and Yao (2011)</ref> also note that most existing work uses posted prices to estimate the price dispersion, which may lead to an overestimation of price dispersion. Instead, they suggest using actual transaction prices (i.e., market clearing prices) to evaluate the extent of price dispersion. We believe prices may interrelate and influence price dispersions in a single electronic market. In addition, prices may interact with the preceding factors, which may serve as covariates that further affect the cross effects. For example, the interaction of the number of merchants and Amazon_price might cause a variation in other prices, such as the Lowest_used_price. Amazon, as a retailer and online marketplace, sets the price strategy, which implies a broad stream of interesting research questions. This data set also reveals the number of merchants that sell new, used, and refurbished products, each of which is a possible covariate that could drive the effects of price dispersion. Therefore, all six price variables could be dependent variables for marketing research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Translating Sales Ranks to Sales Quantities</head><p>The integration of structured product information and unstructured consumer-generated product reviews is another unique feature of our Tablet Computer data set that can support a research trend in textual analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Onishi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Manchanda 2012, Tirunillai and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tellis 2012)</ref>. That is, research has shown that consumer reviews relate closely to sales <ref type="bibr">Mayzlin 2006, Liu 2006</ref>). However, Amazon does not provide product-level sales information, and data regarding sales volumes of tablet computers are not available in public sources.</p><p>Amazon provides sales ranks of products within a particular product category. We could use the log of sales rank as a dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Archak et al. 2011</ref>), but growing empirical literature instead offers sophisticated methods to map Amazon's sales ranking data onto product-level sales quantities. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003)</ref> translate Amazon sales ranking data into Amazon sales using an experimental calibration. Continued research uses this technique in various contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ghose et al. 2006, Smith and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Telang 2009)</ref>. By applying this translation, "sales" becomes available as a dependent variable. Existing literature also indicates that several factors may or may not matter for sales, such as valence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006)</ref>, volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Liu 2006)</ref>, and the reviewer's decision to reveal his or her identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Forman et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moe and Trusov (2011)</ref> also show that ratings have not only a direct effect on product sales but also a significant indirect effect through future ratings and through the ratinggeneration process.</p><p>In this sense, this data set provides sales research opportunities in at least two realms. First, positive and negative valences might be judged not solely by ratings but could also be obtained by mining the textual reviews. Second, other than dynamic rating data, variables such as valence and volume, text reviews, and identity information can be collected in a longitudinal setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Text Analytics and Market Structure Analysis</head><p>Unlike traditional surveys or transaction records collected from legacy systems, consumer-generated product reviews contain rich consumer insights and behavioral information. Researchers can examine qualitative consumer-generated reviews and automate market structure analyses by applying text mining and sentiment analysis techniques. Text mining the product reviews contributed freely by consumers can lead to the discovery of consumer usage situations, preferences, and sentiments toward product attributes. Advanced text mining techniques support analyses of linguistic and semantic structures in the review sentiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Turney and Pantel 2010)</ref>. Thus, they uncover embedded consumer opinions (i.e., voices of consumers) that in turn reveal more sophisticated consumer preferences and insights to advance market structure analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Netzer et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Obtaining and Using the Data Set</head><p>The Marketing Science website (http://pubsonline .informs.org/page/mksc/online-databases) provides the link to the website maintained by the authors with additional instructions about accessing and using the Tablet Computer data set. To explore the textual content of the reviews, researchers can use natural language processing tools such as Stanford CoreNLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Socher et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Toutanova et al. 2003</ref>, Apache OpenNLP, 4 or the Natural Language Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bird et al. 2009</ref>) to extract information. These free text analytic tools support common linguistic processing methods, including sentence boundary detection, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Noting the effort required to set up these tools, we provide the parsed content of 40,741 tablet computer reviews, obtained using Stanford CoreNLP (version 3.2.0). The parsed reviews are available in XML format, which most statistical packages can read and import.</p><p>Although this data set pertains to tablet computers, researchers can use the proposed data collection method to obtain even more recent reviews or data about different product categories. We also share our crawling program to facilitate research that seeks to collect data available on the Internet. This will benefit researchers who wish to obtain consumer-generated product reviews of a different product category.</p><p>Two research issues should be considered when using the consumer-generated product reviews. First, bogus (fake) reviews may have been submitted to Amazon. Bogus reviews seek to mislead both consumers and sentiment analysis systems, either to promote or to damage a particular product's reputation. Users should refer to research related to detecting and filtering out fake reviews (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lim et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Mukherjee et al. 2012</ref>. Second, the nouns and noun phrases derived from the product reviews may contain synonyms or homonyms, because reviewers use various noun phrases to describe the same product attributes, and the same noun phrases extracted might refer to different product attributes. However, we expect this concern to be minimal, because this data set was collected for a particular product category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary</head><p>The first decade of 21st century has experienced phenomenal, exponential growth in digital data. In the big data era, both UGC and manufacturer-provided content are readily available and can expand the horizons of marketing research. We offer a tablet computer data set for the marketing science community, which contains collected, filtered, and integrated product characteristic information, market dynamic information, consumer-generated product reviews, and reviewer information spanning a period of 24 weeks. This data set should help accelerate the drive toward big data analytics, as well as benefit the practice and study of marketing. Our approach for generating this data set provides academic researchers and practitioners with insights into an innovative data collection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mela 2011)</ref>, supporting relevant research even when reliable and representative data are missing or difficult to obtain. In particular, our Tablet Computer data set can be used to answer many interesting research questions, even beyond those we proposed in §3.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(2) Item_ID; (3) Base_item_ID; (4) Reviewer_ID, which identifies the customer without disclosing personal information; (5) Review_date; (6) Title; (7) Review; and</figDesc></figure>
