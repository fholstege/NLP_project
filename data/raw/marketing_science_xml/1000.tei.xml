<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Durable goods manufacturers often design product lines by segmenting their markets on quality attributes-attributes that exhibit a ''more is better'' property for all consumers. Since products within a product line are partial substitutes, and consumers can self-select the products they want to purchase, multiproduct firms have to carefully consider the cannibalization problem in designing their product lines. Existing research has analyzed the cannibalization problem for a monopolist who faces consumers who differ in their quality valuations. If lower-quality products are sufficiently attractive, higher-valuation consumers may find it beneficial to buy lower-quality products rather than the higherquality products targeted to them. That is, lower-quality products can potentially cannibalize higher-quality products. The cannibalization problem forces the firm to provide only the highestvaluation segment with its preferred (efficient) quality. All other segments get qualities lower than their preferred (efficient) qualities. When the cannibalization problem is very severe, the firm may not serve some of the lowest-valuation segments.</p><p>However, not much is known about how and when the cannibalization problem affects product line design in an oligopoly. Also, consumers may differ not only in their quality valuations but also in their taste preferences. The objective of this paper is to fill these gaps by examining whether the cannibalization problem affects a firm's price and quality decisions in a model with consumer differences in quality valuations, as well as in their taste preferences, in both monopoly and duopoly settings. The paper addresses questions such as the following. With both types of consumer differences, should a firm, even a monopolist, provide efficient quality only to the top segment? Are there conditions under which other segments can also get their preferred quality levels? If so, how do consumer and firm characteristics affect the likelihood of different segments getting their preferred qualities? How does competition affect the firm's choice of qualities?</p><p>I develop a model in which the market is made up of two segments, with one segment valuing quality more than the other. Consumers within each segment are distributed over <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hotelling's (1929)</ref> linear city. Consumers in the two segments can have different taste preferences (transportation costs). Firm locations in the two segments may also be different.</p><p>The paper begins with an analysis of the monopoly case. I find that when both segments are fully covered, the standard selfselection results of the high-valuation segment getting its preferred quality and the low-valuation segment getting less than its preferred quality do hold. Interestingly, when both segments are incompletely covered, under some conditions, the monopolist's price and quality choices are not determined by the cannibalization problem. In these cases, the monopolist finds it optimal to provide each segment with its preferred quality. Thus, the equilibrium quality levels in a second-degree price discrimination situation resemble the third-degree price discrimination solution. I characterize the relevant conditions in terms of consumer characteristics.</p><p>I then consider the case of two firms competing in the market, each offering two products-one for the high-valuation segment and the other for the low-valuation segment. Here also both types of outcomes are possible, depending on consumers and firm characteristics. Under some conditions, the cannibalization problem does not affect the firms' price and quality choices, and each firm provides each segment with that segment's preferred quality. Each firm finds it optimal to serve both segments. When these conditions do not hold, only the high-valuation segment gets its preferred quality. I interpret the conditions necessary for these results to exist in terms of characteristics of the consumers and the firms.</p><p>An interesting insight from the analysis is that as the taste preferences of the low-valuation segment become weaker (their ''transportation cost'' becomes lower), the more intense competition in the low-valuation segment makes it more attractive for the high-valuation consumers to buy the products meant for the low-valuation segment. This worsens the cannibalization problem, and the low-valuation segment may not get its preferred quality. On the other hand, when the taste preferences of the high-valuation segments are sufficiently weak, more intense competition in the high-valuation segment reduces that segment's incentives to buy the product meant for the low-valuation segment. This mitigates the cannibalization problem and makes it more likely for the low-valuation segment to get its preferred quality.</p><p>Similarly, when firms are less differentiated in the low-valuation segment, stronger competition between the firms makes the cannibalization problem worse, and the low-valuation segment may not get its preferred quality. When the differentiation between the firms is sufficiently weak in the high-valuation segment, the high-valuation segment is more likely to be better off buying the product meant for it. As the high-valuation segment's incentives to buy the lower-quality product are reduced, the lowvaluation segment is more likely to get its preferred quality. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Background</head><p>We see quality-based segmentation in almost all durable product categories. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For example, Sony's TV line includes 27-, 32-, and 35-inch models, and models within each screen size differ in terms of features such as picture-in-picture, freeze memo, wideband video amplifier, etc. Toyota makes luxury cars under the Lexus name and traditional cars under the Toyota name. Within its Toyota line are cars ranging from the small Tercel to the full-size Avalon. These are examples of firms creating product lines made up of different price-quality bundles in order to serve different consumer segments. Higher-price, higher-quality products are targeted to consumers who care more about quality and are willing to pay higher prices for higher-quality products. Lower-price, lower-quality products are meant for consumers who value quality less, and are not willing to pay higher prices for higher-quality levels. Since price and quality are the two dimensions that define different items in a given product line, it is critical to understand how price and quality levels are determined. I examine a firm's choice of price and quality levels for different items within its product line.</p><p>Several important papers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz (1984)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref> have analyzed this problem in monopoly settings. They emphasize the fact that consumers self-select the product they purchase. If the lower-quality products are sufficiently attractive, higher-end consumers may find it beneficial to buy lower-quality products rather than higher-quality products targeted to them. That is, lower-quality products can potentially cannibalize sales of higher-quality products. This cannibalization problem becomes the primary determinant of the optimal price-quality profile in these papers. To alleviate this cannibalization problem, a firm makes lowerquality products relatively unattractive to higher-end consumers. Specifically, the firm provides the top-val-uation segment with its preferred (efficient) quality. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> However, it distorts the qualities of all other products, so that all other segments get quality levels lower than their preferred levels. This effect of the cannibalization problem in determining price and quality levels in a monopoly is well established, and several papers employ this basic setup to investigate a variety of interesting problems (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Desai et al. 2001</ref>). However, not much is known about how cannibalization can affect price and quality choice in an oligopoly.</p><p>In addition, consumer heterogeneity in monopoly models is typically restricted to quality valuations. That is, all consumers differ only in terms of how much they are willing to pay for a given level of quality. Clearly, consumers differ in other respects too, especially in terms of how they value nonqualityi.e., taste-attributes. The existing literature doesn't say much about quality segmentation in markets where consumers differ in terms of both their quality valuations and their taste preferences.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to fill these gaps by examining whether the cannibalization problem affects a firm's price and quality decisions in a model with consumer differences in quality valuations as well as taste preferences in both monopoly and duopoly settings. The paper addresses questions such as the following. With both types of consumer differences, should a firm, even a monopolist, provide efficient quality only to the top segment? Are there conditions under which other segments can also get their preferred quality levels? If so, how do consumer and firm characteristics affect the likelihood of different segments getting their preferred qualities? How does competition affect the firm's choice of qualities?</p></div>

The consumers within a segment are represented by a linear market as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hotelling (1929)</ref>. The taste preference of a specific consumer is represented by his/her location on the line. The ''transportation cost'' of a segment represents the strength of its taste preferences. The model also allows for the possibility that high-valuation consumers may also have stronger taste preferences (higher transportation cost) than low-valuation consumers.</p><p>Since most discrimination takes place in oligopolistic markets, I analyze both monopoly and duopoly settings. In duopoly settings, I allow competing firms to be more differentiated in the high-valuation market than in the low-valuation market (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Depending on consumer and firm characteristics, both efficient and inefficient quality provisions are possible in both monopoly and duopoly. In other words, it is possible that even a monopolist provides efficient quality to both segments. On the other hand, it is also possible that the insights from the existing monopoly analysis are valid even in a duopoly setting. In both settings, there are conditions under which the self-selection constraints are not binding in equilibrium, so that the cannibalization problem does not determine the product line design and firms provide efficient qualities to both segments. Thus, the equilibrium quality levels in a second-degree price discrimination situation resemble the third-degree price discrimination solution. An interesting issue, then, is to understand the conditions under which the cannibalization problem does not affect the product line design. My analysis identifies and characterizes these conditions, which are discussed in detail later. Here I highlight two important factors. As the taste preferences of the low-valuation segment become weaker (their transportation cost becomes lower), the more intense competition in the low-valuation segment makes it more attractive for the high-valuation consumers to buy the products meant for the lowvaluation segment. This worsens the cannibalization problem, and the low-valuation segment may not get its preferred quality. On the other hand, when the taste preferences of the high-valuation segments are sufficiently weak, more intense competition in the high-valuation segment reduces that segment's incen-tives to buy the product meant for the low-valuation segment. This mitigates the cannibalization problem and makes it more likely for the low-valuation segment to get its preferred quality.</p><p>Similarly, when firms are less differentiated in the low-valuation segment, stronger competition between the firms makes the cannibalization problem worse, and the low-valuation segment may not gets its preferred quality. When the differentiation between the firms is sufficiently weak in the high-valuation segment, the high-valuation segment is more likely to be better off buying the product meant for it. As the high-valuation segment's incentives to buy the lowerquality product are reduced, the low-valuation segment is more likely to get its preferred quality.</p><p>These and other results provide important insights on how firms should carry out quality-based segmentation. A key insight from the standard self-selection models is that the kind of segmentation that marketing textbooks typically recommend-providing each customer segment with its preferred quality-is infeasible because of the cannibalization problem. However, the cannibalization problem may not be the critical determinant of product quality even for a monopolist. In the presence of competition, the issue of cannibalization becomes even less serious because the within-segment competition between firms may be more important than between-segments competition between a single firm's products (cannibalization).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Related Literature</head><p>Product Line Quality in Monopoly. To provide more background on the monopoly self-selection models, the existing self-selection models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz (1984)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref> are reviewed with the help of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref> model. In an influential paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref> considers a monopolist serving multiple consumer segments differing in their valuations for quality. Highervaluation segments derive greater marginal utility from quality, and hence are willing to pay a higher price for a given quality product than lower-valuation segments. It is optimal for the monopolist to create multiple products (price-quality bundles) so that higher-valuation consumers buy higher-quality products at higher prices. However, he points out that since consumers self-select the products they purchase, higher-valuation consumers may find that a lower-quality product gives them higher utility than purchasing the product aimed at them and will purchase the lower-quality product. In marketing terms, lower-quality products can potentially cannibalize higher-quality products. Ensuring that this cannibalization problem does not undermine the segmentation scheme is the central task of the firm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref>. He finds that the optimal price-quality bundles are such that only the highest-valuation segment gets its preferred quality. The qualities of products aimed at all other segments are distorted downwards, and are at strictly less than efficient levels. In addition, under some conditions the cannibalization problem forces the firm not to serve some of the lowest-valuation segments. The price of the lowest-quality product is set in such a way that the lowest-valuation consumer gets no rents from purchasing the product. That is, the lowest-valuation segment is indifferent between buying the product targeted to it and not purchasing any product. Prices of all other products are set in such a way that each segment is indifferent between purchasing its product and the product targeted at the next lower-valuation segment. All segments other than the lowest-valuation segment get strictly positive rents from purchasing their products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref> derive similar insights in a model with a continuous distribution of consumer valuations. 3 Product Line Quality in Duopoly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz (1984)</ref> shows the interdependence between markets for high-quality and low-quality goods. His duopoly model is similar to mine; however, the firms' locations are fixed at the two extremes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz's (1984)</ref> monopoly results are similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Moorthy (1984)</ref>. In his duopoly analysis he assumes that both firms serve all consumers in both markets, and shows that standard self-selection re-sults arise when consumers self-select. If the self-selection constraints are nonexistent, or if the firms are not differentiated, then the two firms provide efficient qualities. Although he raises the possibility that selfselection constraints may not be binding in a duopoly under some conditions, he does not show this result or identify such conditions. In contrast, this paper shows that even in the presence of self-selection constraints, both efficient and inefficient quality provisions are possible in both monopoly and duopoly. I also identify and characterize the conditions under which both segments get efficient qualities, and I consider incomplete market coverage, which is not analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz (1984)</ref>.</p><p>A recent working paper by Rochet and Stole (1998) has independently shown that when consumers' valuations for quality are sufficiently different and firms have symmetric costs, firms provide efficient quality to all consumers. They also more fully characterize the solution when consumers' downward self-selection constraints are binding. They consider a more general horizontal distribution of consumers but allow the segments to vary only in terms of quality valuations. Schmidt-Mohr and Villas-Boas (1997) analyze a similar model and show that the screening solution involves pooling of customer types at the top and at the bottom of the quality-valuation distribution. Villas-Boas and Schmidt-Mohr (1999) also analyze a similar model in the context of credit markets and show that more differentiated firms compete less intensively for the most profitable consumers, and may screen loan applications less intensively. Interestingly, they show that total profits may increase or decrease in the presence of asymmetric information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armstrong and Vickers (1999)</ref> analyze competitive price discrimination and examine the effect of price discrimination on consumer welfare. They show, among other things, that in a model of consumers differing in their valuations for quantity, one of the equilibria involves firms pricing a given quantity at cost plus a constant. However, these papers do not allow for differences between segments in terms of taste preferences and different firm locations in the two markets. Also, my focus is on identifying the conditions under which the cannibalization problem does not determine the equilibrium price and quality levels.</p><p>Product Line Strategy with Exogenous Quality Levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gilbert and Matutes (1993)</ref> examine competition between the product lines of two spatially differentiated manufacturers. Assuming exogenous quality levels, they examine whether the two firms would specialize to serve one segment each. They show that firms produce full product lines when the differentiation between them is sufficiently large. However, if a firm can move first and commit not to serve a market, specialization may occur as the differentiation between the two firms approaches zero.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 presents the analysis for the monopoly case. The analysis of the duopoly case is given in §4. I conclude with a summary and discussion of key results in §5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model</head><p>I develop a model of a market characterized by both quality (vertical) and taste (horizontal) differentiation.</p><p>Consumers. There are two consumer segments, a high-valuation segment and a low-valuation segment. The high-and low-valuation segments are denoted by H and L, respectively. There are N H consumers in the high-valuation segment, and N L consumers in the low-valuation segment. A consumer in segment i (i ϭ H, L) derives a utility of H q from using a product of quality q. Here the quality variable, q, is a summary measure of all more-is-better attributes of the product. For example, for a personal computer, the quality variable q can be a composite of the CPU speed, bus size, number of drives, access speed, monitor size, etc. Consumers within each segment are uniformly distributed on a [0, 1] line segment representing a linear market <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hotelling 1929)</ref>, and incur a transportation cost of k i per unit length traveled. The horizontal distribution of consumers represents taste differences among consumers. Taste attributes refer to those product attributes for which all consumers are not in agreement. Each consumer may have his/her ideal product-his/her most preferred bundle of these at-tributes. A consumer's location on the [0, 1] line segment, x, describes the consumer's ideal point. The transportation cost is the disutility that a consumer suffers from using a product other than his/her ideal product and represents the strength of consumers' taste preferences. To model the possibility that higher valuation consumers also have stronger taste preferences, the two segments are allowed to have two different transportation costs. In particular, k H Ն k L .</p><p>A consumer with valuation i (i ϭ H, L) and location x from the left extreme on the [0, 1] line segment derives a utility of U( i , x) ϭ i q Ϫ k i t Ϫ p, where q is the product quality, p is the retail price of the product, and t is a given product's distance from the consumer's ideal point-i.e., the distance that the consumer has to travel to purchase the product. Each consumer has the option of not purchasing any product on the market. The no-purchase option gives the consumer zero utility.</p><p>Firms. In the duopoly, there are two symmetric firms, labeled A and B, competing in the market. Each firm can produce up to one product for each segment. Firm j's ( j ϭ A, B) product for segment i (i ϭ H, L) is referred to by its quality level, q ij . Each firm has a fixed location on a given line segment, which represents consumers' perceptions of the taste attributes offered by the firm. The distance between the locations of the two firms represents taste-based differentiation between products of the two firms. As Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows, on the line for segment i (i ϭ H, L), Firm A is located at a distance a i and Firm B is located at a distance b i from the left extreme, with a i Ͻ ½ and b i ϭ l Ϫ a i Ͼ ½.</p><p>It is often more difficult to differentiate lower-quality products, which have fewer features and less functionality than higher-quality products. To model this, in the duopoly analysis a L (and b L ) can be different from a H (and b H ). In particular, b H Ϫ a H Ն b L Ϫ a L in the duopoly analysis. Another way to think about this difference is to recognize that consumers' perceptions of the two firms may be different in the two segments. If the two firms are closely located, there will not be any pure strategy equilibrium in the price subgame <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(D'Aspremont et al. 1979</ref>). I assume that firms are sufficiently separated so that there is a pure strategy equilibrium in the price subgame. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In monopoly we consider only Firm A, with qualities q i and prices p i (i ϭ H, L). Because product differentiation issues don't matter in monopoly, we set a H ϭ a L for simplicity.</p><p>While firms may target a given segment with a specific product (quality), they cannot identify the location or the valuation of a given consumer. The production cost functions are identical for both firms. The marginal cost of producing a product of quality q is c(q) ϭ ␥q 2 /2. For ease of exposition, the cost of producing product q ij , c(q ij ), is often denoted c ij .</p><p>It is easy to see that when both products are priced at the marginal costs, Segment i's (i ϭ H, L) optimal quality choice is q ϭ i /␥. I refer to this quality level e i as Segment i's preferred quality level or efficient quality level.</p><p>There are three stages in the game. In Stage 1, each firm chooses its quality level for each segment. In Stage 2, each firm chooses the prices for its products. In Stage 3, consumers decide whether or not to purchase any product, and choose which product to purchase if they decide to purchase a product.</p></div>

All proofs are in the appendix.</p><p>Proposition 1 shows that under certain conditions the monopolist's cannibalization problem does not affect its quality choices. The downward-sloping de-mand functions mentioned earlier play an important role here. Consider what would happen in the present case with the standard solution given in (1)-(2). Suppose the firm chooses prices such that the high-valuation consumers are just indifferent between buying high-quality and buying low-quality products. Now, by reducing the price of the high-quality product slightly, the firm can increase its demand from the high-valuation segment without violating any constraints. If the firm can increase its profits by increasing the demand of the high-quality product and giving more surplus to some of the high-valuation consumers in the process, the standard self-selection solution will not work. This is precisely what happens when the above condition is satisfied.</p><p>The above condition is more likely to be satisfied when segment heterogeneity in quality valuation ( H Ϫ L ) is much greater than that in taste preferences (k H Ϫ k L ). Higher transportation costs are equivalent to lower price sensitivity and reduce a segment's response to price changes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">M ‫ץ‬x 1 i ϭ Ϫ Ͻ 0 . M ‫ץ‬p k i i</formula><p>With k H Ͼ k L , the high-valuation segment responds less to price changes than the low-valuation consumers. Therefore, higher transportation costs in the highvaluation segment reduce the firm's incentives to reduce prices in that segment compared with the other segment. On the other hand, when the H Ϫ L difference is sufficiently high, the firm would like to get greater demand from the high-valuation segment than from the low-valuation segment, and its incentive to cover more of the high-valuation segment is increased. When the H Ϫ L difference relative to the k H Ϫ k L difference is sufficiently high, the self-selection constraint is not binding for any high-valuation consumer who purchases the product. At this stage, the firm does not have to use quality distortions to make purchasing the low-quality product unattractive to high-valuation consumers. In other words, even if we determine the optimal prices and qualities by ignoring the self-selection constraint, these prices and qualities satisfy the self-selection constraints for all active consumers.</p><p>Note that Proposition 1 is valid only for those parameter values for which the firm finds it optimal not to serve either segment fully. This is true if Ͻ 2(2 2 i Ϫ a L )␥k i for i ϭ H, L. That is, for each segment taste preferences (k i ) should be relatively high in comparison to quality valuation ( i ). If H is sufficiently higher than k H , specifically, if Ն 2(2 Ϫ a H )␥k H , the firm 2 H finds it optimal to serve the high-valuation segment fully. In that case, Proposition 1 results are not valid. In fact, it can be shown that if the high-valuation segment is fully served, the optimal strategy for the firm is to provide inefficient quality to the low-valuation segment.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">When Ն 2(2 Ϫ a L )␥k L in addition to 2 2 L H Ն 2(2 Ϫ a H</formula><p>)␥k H , both segments are fully covered and the standard self-selection results apply.

A similar preference structure holds for the low-valuation consumers. If all the self-selection constraints are satisfied, the demand for Firm A's product q iA , d iA , is given by d iA ϭ N i x i , and the demand for Firm B's product q iB , d iB , is given by d iB ϭ N i (1 Ϫ x i ). I first solve a more general problem, viz., unconstrained optimization of each firm's objective function. Simultaneously solving the two firms' unconstrained problems gives the following solution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">1 D* 2 p ϭ [2(2 ϩ a ϩ b )␥k ϩ 3 ], iA i i i i 6␥ 1 i D* 2 D* p ϭ [2(4 Ϫ a Ϫ b )␥k ϩ 3 ], q ϭ , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">) iB i i i i ij 6␥ ␥</formula><p>where i ϭ H, L and j ϭ A, B. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">3</ref>) shows that when firms are not restricted by self-selection constraints, in equilibrium they provide each segment with that segment's preferred product quality. This is not surprising because it is the existence of self-selection constraints that induces firms in the standard self-selection models to distort the quality to the low-valuation segment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Katz (1984)</ref> also shows a similar result. However, what is surprising is that the above solution satisfies self-selection constraints under some conditions, and therefore becomes the equilibrium outcome even when each firm faces self-selection constraints.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">PROPOSITION 2. When Ϫ2␥[(1 ϩ a L Ϫ a H )k H Ϫ k L ] ϩ ( H Ϫ L ) 2 Ն 0</formula><p>, each firm provides each segment with that segment' s preferred quality in equilibrium; otherwise, the high-valuation segment gets its preferred quality, and the low-valuation segment gets lower than its preferred quality.</p><p>As in the incomplete coverage monopoly case, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve rather than a step-function demand present in the standard self-selection model. The key difference is that in a duopoly, a firm's demand from a segment is affected not only by its own prices but also by the competitor's prices. Therefore, each firm has a greater incentive to reduce prices here than in the earlier case, and the cannibalization problem is less likely to determine the equilibrium quality choices.</p><p>Here also, if the two segments are more different in their quality valuations than in their taste preference, i.e., ( H Ϫ L ) is significantly greater than (k H Ϫ k L ), the firms are more likely to provide each segment with its preferred quality levels. The intuition is similar to the previous case. With weaker taste preference, the low-valuation segment is more price sensitive. This increases the intensity of competition between the two firms and reduces prices more in the low-valuation segment than in the high-valuation segment. As prices in the low-valuation segment fall, the high-valuation consumers have greater incentives to purchase the lower-quality product, and self-selection issues become critical again. We might expect that more intense competition in the low-valuation segment would make it more likely that this segment gets its preferred quality. It turns out that the reverse is true.</p><p>The firms' quality choices are also affected by their locations and the extent of differentiation between them. If the two firms are more differentiated in the high-valuation segment than in the low-valuation segment, they are less likely to provide efficient quality to the low-valuation segment. In this case, the highvaluation consumer farther away from the firm incurs a greater transportation cost in buying the high-quality product than the low-quality product. This again increases the high-valuation consumers' incentives to purchase the low-quality product, making self-selection issues more serious. Here also, one might expect that reduced differentiation between the two firms in the low-valuation segment would give them greater incentives to provide efficient quality. However, reduced differentiation in the low-valuation market can make the cannibalization problem more serious, and therefore, makes it less likely that the low-valuation segment will get the efficient quality.</p><p>The traditional monopoly self-selection solution prescribes that the high-valuation consumers be given just enough surplus to make them indifferent between buying the high-quality product intended for them and buying the lower-quality product. Proposition 2 shows that when the above condition is sat-isfied, such a pricing policy is suboptimal in a duopoly. In particular, due to competitive pressures, a firm's ability to extract more surplus out of the highvaluation segment is limited. High-valuation consumers can not only buy the low-quality product of the same firm, but also the high-quality product of the competitor. Therefore, if either firm tries to make the high-valuation consumers just indifferent between purchasing its high-quality and low-quality products, its price for the high-quality product will end up being too high, and it will lose market share in the highvaluation segment to the competing firm. Similarly, neither firm can extract all the surplus from any lowvaluation consumer, because doing so will result in a loss of market share to the competing firm.</p><p>Interestingly, the price that the high-valuation segment pays depends only on that segment's characteristics and not on the characteristics of the low-valuation segment, as in the standard self-selection models. Because the high-valuation segment has stronger taste preferences, the equilibrium price-cost margins are higher for the higher-quality product. This is in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armstrong and Vickers (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Rochet and Stole (1999)</ref>, who assume that both segments have the same strength of taste preferences and find that the price-cost margins are the same for all items in the product line in the efficient solution.</p><p>As in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hotelling (1929)</ref> model, each firm may have incentives to cut prices and attract consumers from the other firm's ''territory'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(D'Aspremont et al. 1979)</ref>.

This is in contrast to the standard self-selection result of the firm not serving the low-valuation segment when the relative valuation and size of the low-valuation segment are small. The reason for Proposition 3 results is that the rents accruing to the high-valuation segment depend on the competitor's high-quality product's price and quality and the degree of competition between the two firms; they do not depend on the relative size and valuation of the low-valuation segment. In other words, not serving the low-valuation segment does not affect the profitability of serving the high-valuation segment. This result is related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gilbert's and Matutes' (1993)</ref> result on differentiated firms choosing to offer full product lines. However, as noted before, the Proposition 3 result is based on endogenous quality choices by the two firms.

If the inactive consumers are only in the middle of the line segments, then each firm enjoys a monopoly and the analysis is nearly identical to the analysis of the monopoly incomplete coverage case discussed in §3.1.

In particular, if the two segments differ more in terms of their valuations and less in terms of their other characteristics-the strength of their taste preferences and their perceptions of the two firms-equilibrium outcome would involve both segments getting their preferred qualities from the two competitors in the equilibrium. If the segments differ less in terms of their valuations and more in terms of their taste preferences and perceptions of the two firms, then the standard self-selection results of firms distorting the quality for the low-valuations segment arise.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Consumer Welfare Implications</head><p>It is well known that in the standard self-selection results, the low-valuation consumers get no rents and the high-valuation consumers get just enough rents to make them indifferent between purchasing the high-quality product targeted to them and purchasing low-quality products targeted to the other segment. Similar results arise in my model when the low-valuation segment gets lower than its preferred quality-all high-valuation consumers get just enough rents so that they purchase the product targeted to them. Among the low-valuation consumers, only the last consumer to purchase the low-quality product in the incomplete coverage cases gets no rents. All other low-valuation consumers get rents.</p><p>A more interesting case arises when both segments get their preferred qualities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Discussion</head><p>Both efficient and inefficient quality provisions can arise in monopoly as well as in duopoly. I have identified and characterized conditions under which the cannibalization problem does not determine the equilibrium quality choices so that both segments get efficient quality. Under these conditions, the equilibrium quality levels in a second-degree price discrimination situation resemble the third-degree price discrimination solution. These conditions in general depend on three factors: (1) the trade-off between quality and taste preferences ( i and k i ) in the consumers' utility function, (2) the differences between the segments ( H vs. L and k H vs. k L ), and (3) the nature of competition between the two firms in a duopoly.</p><p>The trade-off between quality and taste preference determines whether the entire market is covered. If the taste preferences are relatively stronger, some consumers will not purchase any product. With incomplete market coverage, even a monopolist may find it optimal to provide efficient quality to each segment. On the other hand, if the market is fully covered, a monopolist will provide efficient quality only to the high-valuation segment. In a duopoly, the efficient quality provision can arise with either type of market coverage.</p><p>Firms are more likely to provide each segment with its preferred quality when the two segments differ more in terms of their quality valuations and less in terms of taste preferences. As the taste preference of the low-valuation segment becomes weaker, prices of the products targeted to that segment fall, and the high-valuation consumers have greater incentives to purchase the products targeted to the low-valuation segment. This worsens the cannibalization problem.</p><p>In a duopoly, if the firms are significantly more differentiated in the high-valuation segment than in the low-valuation segment, then lower prices for the products targeted to the low-valuation segment can make the cannibalization problem more serious. In such a case, the low-valuation segment is less likely to get its preferred quality. Thus, less differentiation in the low-valuation market makes it less likely that consumers in this market get their preferred quality.</p><p>A firm may choose not to serve all the consumer segments for a number of reasons. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kotler (2000)</ref> lists excessive design and engineering costs, inventory carrying costs, etc., as possible reasons for not having a full product line. However, cannibalization should not be a reason for dropping a product in a competitive situation when the above conditions are met.</p><p>This analysis also has interesting implications for pricing a product line. When the above conditions are satisfied, making the high-valuation consumers indifferent between choosing the high-quality product and the low-quality product is no longer a critical issue. Instead, the pricing policy for a segment depends on the characteristics of the consumers in that segment and degree of differentiation between the firms in that segment. In duopoly with full market coverage, the per-unit margins depend on the strength of taste preferences. When both segments have identical taste preferences, the per-unit margins are the same for both products. When the high-valuation segment has stronger taste preferences, the per-unit margins are higher for higher-quality products. When the markets are incompletely covered, the per-unit margins in duopoly are higher for higher-quality products.</p><p>Limitations and Directions for Future Research. I have not fully characterized the inefficient solution. Interested readers are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rochet and Stole (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Schmidt-Mohr and Villas-Boas (1997)</ref> for details on this solution, including results on bunching. I have used <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hotelling's (1929)</ref> linear market to model competition between the two firms. In practice, multiple firms compete in each segment. Therefore, it may be interesting to see if these results can be replicated in a model with a different type of competition and with multiple firms. We also observe firms occupying multiple locations in a given segment. For example, Ford Motor Company makes cars under Ford and Mercury brand names. Similarly, General Motors makes cars under several brand names. More research is needed to study how a firm's price and quality strategies change when they compete in a segment under multiple brand names, occupying multiple locations. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> consumers than the minimum necessary for the self-selection constraint to hold.

It is easy to see that low-valuation consumers to the left of x H and x L are better off buying the high-quality product of Firm A than buying the high-quality product of Firm B. It can be shown that the upward self-selection constraints are also satisfied. When the selfselection constraints are not satisfied by the unconstrained solution, the low-valuation segment gets distorted quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Moorthy 1984)</ref>. Ⅺ To prove Proposition 3, I need to show that neither firm is better off by unilaterally deviating from offering two products to offering only one product. A deviation that targets only the low-valuation segment is clearly dominated. Therefore, I now consider a case in which Firm A serves only the high-valuation segment and Firm B serves both segments. Here there are two possibilites: (1) Firm B serves the entire low-valuation segment, or (2) Firm B serves only a part of the low-valuation segment.</p><p>In Case (1) it can be shown that if the condition in Proposition 2 is satisfied, then both offer efficient qualities, and Firm A's profit is x quality for the low-valuation segment such that the low-valuation consumer at x ϭ a L gets a small positive utility ⑀. In the highvaluation segment, the consumers at H get the lowest rents. There-4 x fore, the high-valuation consumers at x ϭ a L get at least k H ( H Ϫ 4 x a L ) Ͼ ⑀ utility from buying Firm A's high-quality product, and will continue to buy the high-quality product from Firm A. Thus, Firm A can generate additional profits by introducing a distinct product for the low-valuation segment. Similar logic works if L Յ a L . Here 4 x Firm A can make additional profits by serving the low-valuation consumers at a L by choosing a price and a quality such that these consumers get a slightly higher utility from purchasing Firm A's product, than purchasing Firm B's product. Given that Firm A's high-valuation consumers are not purchasing Firm B's low-quality product, they will continue to purchase Firm A's high-quality product. This way, Firm A can make a higher profit by serving the lowvaluation segment.</p><p>Using similar arguments, it can be shown that Firm A serving only one segment (e.g., high valuation) and Firm B serving the other segment (low valuation) is not an equilibrium.
