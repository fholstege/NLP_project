<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>American corporations collectively spend over $500 billion on marketing activities; even individual companies such as Procter and Gamble spend several billion dollars on advertising and promotion. Consequently, the optimal allocation of marketing resources to multiple activities-referred to as "planning the marketing mix"-is of paramount importance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mantrala 2002</ref> for literature review). In the extant literature, dynamic planning models such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Silva-Risso et al. (1999)</ref> provide decisionsupport tools to determine advertising schedules and promotional calendars, respectively. These decisionsupport models, however, ignore the game-theoretic principle of strategic foresight, a notion that requires the brand manager to look forward, i.e., anticipate how other competing brands are likely to make future <ref type="bibr">Naik, Raman, and Winer: Planning Marketing-Mix Strategies in</ref>  decisions, and then reason backward, i.e., deduce one's own optimal decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other brands. On the other hand, dynamic game-theoretic models that advocate strategic foresight ignore the role of interactions among multiple marketing activities. Such interactions are central to the marketing-mix concept, which " emphasizes that marketing efforts create sales synergistically rather than independently" (see <ref type="bibr">Gatignon and Hanssens 1987, p. 247;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lilien et al. 1992, p. 5</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gatignon 1993</ref> for a literature review).</p><p>The joint consideration of both strategic foresight and interaction effects in dynamic response models represents an important gap in the marketing literature. For example, <ref type="bibr">Fruchter and Kalish (1998, p. 22</ref>) acknowledge " the limitations of current studies <ref type="bibr">[not]</ref> to take into account the interactions among the different instruments. A challenge which we see for a future direction is to develop a model which incorporates interactions between promotional instruments."</p><p>The challenging problems arise for the following two reasons. First, as we show later, in the presence of interaction effects, the optimal plans for all activities are interdependent, thereby requiring managers to account for the interactivity trade-offs in budget allocations. In other words, the optimal level to spend on advertising depends on the optimal level to spend on promotion (and vice versa). Second, managers need to know the joint effectiveness of marketing activities of all other brands to be able to determine their own optimal marketing-mix plans. This demands a new methodology for estimating dynamic models of oligopoly markets using market data. Thus, both the substantive problems-the determination of optimal marketing-mix strategies and the estimation of dynamic models for oligopoly markets-are unsolved research topics because the necessary methodology does not yet exist in marketing, economics, or management science (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Erickson 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Kamien and Schwartz 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Dockner et al. 2000</ref>.</p><p>Given this gap in the literature, one cannot answer basic questions of managerial interest: Do advertising and promotion amplify or attenuate their impact on market outcomes (e.g., brand share) when used together? How should managers allocate resources to advertising and promotion in the presence of interaction effects? What is the level of optimal budget and its allocation to promotional activities in the presence of strategic foresight? Is own (or competitor's) brand underadvertising or overpromoting, or both? If brand A's interaction effect increases, should brand B optimally respond by increasing advertising or increasing promotion?</p><p>To help answer such questions, we develop two methods: (i) a marketing-mix algorithm to plan optimal marketing-mix strategies and (ii) an estimation method to determine the effectiveness of marketing activities and their interaction effects for each brand in dynamic competitive markets.</p><p>The proposed marketing-mix algorithm solves the multiple-player differential game resulting from the dynamic models of oligopoly markets. Specifically, it yields optimal marketing-mix strategies that are (a) in equilibrium across multiple brands and over time, (b) accounts for intertemporal trade-offs across multiple periods (i.e., now versus later), and (c) balances interactivity trade-off among multiple marketing activities (e.g., advertising versus promotion). Because this algorithm solves a general nonlinear two-point boundary value problem, its applicability extends to several differential game models in marketing, not only the Lanchester model that we present for the sake of exposition (see Remark 2 for details). In addition, it furnishes both the open-loop and closedloop marketing-mix strategies (see the unabridged manuscript, which is available from the authors upon request).</p><p>The proposed estimation method calibrates a simultaneous system of coupled differential equations that arise in the differential game competition in an oligopoly. We note that standard time-series techniques are applicable for discrete-time difference equations (e.g., ARIMA-type models; see <ref type="bibr">Blattberg and Neslin 1990, Ch. 9</ref>) but not for continuoustime models based on differential equations. Hence, we develop an estimation approach for estimating continuous-time models using discrete-time observed data (e.g., weekly). Specifically, this approach provides maximum-likelihood estimates and standard errors that incorporate (a) the temporal dependence in brand shares, (b) their nonstationary dynamics, and (c) the marketing-mix interactions and competitive interdependencies.</p><p>To illustrate the application of these dual methodologies, we extend the Lanchester model in §2. Section 3 analyzes the N -player differential game and constructs the marketing-mix algorithm. Section 4 develops the continuous-discrete estimation approach to estimate dynamic oligopoly models. We present an illustrative example in §5 and conclude in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Extended Lanchester Model</head><p>We extend the classical Lanchester model by introducing the following phenomena: multiple brands in competition, multiple marketing activities that each brand employs to influence its own and competing brands' shares, and interactions between marketing activities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Multiple Brands</head><p>In the classical Lanchester model, two brands compete for market shares using advertising. Let m i t and u i t denote market share and advertising effort, respectively, for brand i, i = 1 and 2. Then, the Lanchester model iṡ</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m 1 = 1 u 1 1 − m 1 − 2 u 2 m 1 (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>whereṁ i = dm i /dt is the rate of change in m i , and i denotes advertising effectiveness. In Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), the change in market share of the first brand is due to two sources. First, the first brand captures some market share from the other brand m 2 = 1 − m 1 via its own advertising (i.e., by increasing 1 or u 1 . Second, it loses market share when the other brand increases advertising or improves effectiveness (i.e., as u 2 or 2 increases).</p><p>Next, we extend this model to an oligopoly market with N brands. For each brand i, i = 1 N , let f i be the force of one's own marketing activities; for example, f 1 = 1 u 1 and f 2 = 2 u 2 in (1). Then, generalizing (1) to N brands, the market share of brand 1 evolves as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dm 1 dt = f 1 1 − m 1 − f 2 m 1 − f 3 m 1 • • • − f i m 1 • • • − f N m 1 (2)</formula><p>We further simplify (2) to obtainṁ 1 = f 1 − F m 1 , where F = N i=1 f i denotes the marketing force of all the brands (including the first brand). Thus, we formulate the N -brand Lanchester model as the simultaneous system of coupled differential equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">  ṁ 1 ṁ N    =    f 1 f N    −    F • • • 0 0 • • • F       m 1 m N    (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Multiple Marketing Activities with Interaction Effects</head><p>Marketing activities such as advertising and promotion generate the marketing force of a brand. Denoting advertising and promotional efforts by u i v i , we specify the marketing force of brand i, i = 1 N ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f i = i u i + i v i + i u i v i (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">where i i</formula><p>represent the advertising and promotion effectiveness, respectively, and i is the interaction effect. Equation (4) states that the marketing force depends not only on the weight of advertising and promotion but also on their interaction; both the weights and effectiveness are brand-specific. Furthermore, each activity can amplify or attenuate the effectiveness of other activities. Assuming positive effect of advertising, when brand i increases u i , it not only increases its brand share m i (directly via Equation ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)) but also influences the effectiveness of the other activity v i because of the nonzero i (indirectly via Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>)). The two activities strengthen the marketing force by creating synergy when &gt; 0; they weaken the marketing force when &lt; 0. Finally, we focus on two marketing activities because no new conceptual issues arise in extending (4) to multiple activities.</p><p>Remark 1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows how the extended Lanchester model augments the marketing literature on important dimensions. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sethi (1977)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Little (1979)</ref> review the literature on dynamic monopoly models with single activity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Erickson (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dockner et al. (2000)</ref> summarize dynamic competitive models with a single activity. By introducing multiple activities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chintagunta and Vilcassim (1994)</ref> and Fruchter and Kalish (1998) extend these differential game models but ignore interactions among these activities. By introducing interaction effects, which are central to the marketing-mix concept (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gatignon and Hanssens 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gatignon 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lilien et al. 1992, p. 5</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Naik and Raman (2003)</ref> establish empirically the existence of synergy and offer theoretical insights into budgeting and allocation decisions. However, they investigate monopoly markets, which ignore a competitor's response to one's own budgeting and allocation decisions. Hence, the extended Lanchester model via (3) and (4) fills this gap in the literature by incorporating both the interaction effects and dynamic competition. Next, we analyze the differential game for this extended model and construct an algorithm that yields equilibrium marketing-mix plans.</p></div>

It further reveals that, in the absence of interaction effects (i.e., when i = 0), advertising plans do not directly depend on the promotion plans. In contrast, in the presence of interaction effects (i.e., when i = 0), optimal advertising u * i t depends directly on the promotion plan v i t . Hence, the interaction effect qualitatively changes the planning of the marketingmix by requiring managers to account for interactivity trade-offs.</p></div>

This switch depends on the co-state variable i t , which involves the strategies of all competing brands. Consequently, each brand forms an expectation of whether other brands would promote or not. By taking expectations, we find that brand i's policy is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">v * i = v i E I D i &gt; 0 = v i Pr −m i + i 1 − m i i + i u i &gt; 0 = v i Pr m i &lt; i i + i u i 1 + i i + i u i = v i i i + i u i 1 + i i + i u i (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where the last equality follows by noting that the support of brand share m i is the unit interval (0, 1), which like the standard uniform variable U yields Pr U &lt; c = c.

Specifically, to look forward, we apply the state dynamics in (3) and (4); to anticipate competitive moves, we evaluate the best strategies using ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">11</ref>); to reason backward, we solve the co-state dynamics in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) from the terminal period to the initial time. Thus, we can systematically create equilibrium marketing-mix plans with strategic foresight by stacking the two systems of differential equations ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) and solving them simultaneously together with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), and (11). To solve the resulting two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP), we next construct a marketing-mix algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Marketing-Mix Algorithm</head><p>We note that extant algorithms in marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deal 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Thompson and Teng 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Erickson 1991</ref> are not applicable to solve the above TPBVP because they ignore the coupling between and within the state and the co-state equations. For example, the coupling of differential equations arises because of the market force F = f i + f j in both (3) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>). Hence, we construct the following algorithm that not only accounts for interequation coupling but also permits a general nonlinear TPBVP specified bẏ</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">y = g y (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>where y andẏ are vectors with 2N elements (i.e., N state and N co-state variables), and denotes the parameter space. Specifically, the algorithm consists of the four steps:</p><p>Step 1. Boundary conditions. Choose M grid points on a timeline, k = 1 2 M, and specify two points for the boundary conditions: the initial k = 0, and the terminal k = M + 1.</p><p>Step 2. Finite difference equations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Create difference equations E k ≡ y k − y k−1 − hg w k , where h = t k − t k−1 , and w k = y k + y k−1 /2.

Using state and co-state trajectories obtained from step 3, determine the marketing-mix plans via (7) through (10), and evaluate their performance via (5).</p><p>For further details, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> in the unabridged manuscript (available from the authors).</p><p>Remark 2. This algorithm is not restricted to the extended Lanchester model; it encompasses other alternative model specifications for dynamic oligopoly markets. Its generality stems from the mathematical structure of a TPBVP, which subsumes several differential games in marketing because all of them are expressible in the form of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">13</ref>). After expressing a game as Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">13</ref>), the above algorithm yields the optimal strategies-only the shape of the link function g • and the set of input arguments y change to accommodate different specifications and phenomena. Specifically, it accommodates different state dynamics instead of (3); different marketing forces instead of (4); different marketing objectives instead of (5); and different phenomena such as channel members, reference prices, or cost functions. Furthermore, it is not restricted to open-loop marketing-mix plans; it also furnishes closed-loop marketing-mix strategies (see §5.3 in the unabridged manuscript). Next, we develop an approach to quantify the effectiveness and interaction effects for each brand in the oligopoly and to infer their statistical significance based on market data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Continuous-Discrete Estimation Method</head><p>We note that the brand-share dynamics in (3) are in continuous time; that is, the time parameter t in the model is continuously differentiable on any interval t t . In contrast, brand-share data arrive at discrete points in time (e.g., weeks).

The estimation of continuous-time models (e.g., Equation (3)) via the ordinary leastsquares (OLS) regression results in biased estimates for the following three reasons. First, the OLS regression requires independence between brand shares at two points in time, Y k and Y k . Clearly, such temporal independence cannot exist because the differential equation (3) explicitly induces dependence over time. Second, this temporal dependence does not vanish or diminish because brand-share dynamics are nonstationary, a fact evident from the transition matrix k in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">14</ref>), which is time-varying because it depends on k. Finally, the shares of all N brands in an oligopoly are highly interdependent on each other's marketing activities. Specifically, we observe from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">14</ref>) that both k and k depend nonlinearly on the marketing forces F and f i . Therefore, in the proposed method, we explicitly account for temporal dependence, nonstationary dynamics, promotional mix interactions, and competitive interdependencies in estimating dynamic oligopoly models. We next illustrate its application to the dynamic oligopoly of detergents brands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Empirical Application</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Data</head><p>We use single-source data for the five detergents brands Tide, Wisk, Era, Solo, and Bold, whose average percentage shares are 43, 19, 16, 13, and 9, respectively. The data consist of the purchase histories, prices paid, cents-off deal, and TV viewing by households over 84 weeks (see <ref type="bibr">Winer 1993 for details)</ref>. Because the Lanchester model is specified at the brand level, researchers usually use market-or storelevel data for calibration (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Little 1979, Chintagunta and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Vilcassim 1994)</ref>. While aggregate market data furnish information on competing brands for many nongrocery products, the household-level data provide opportunities not available in aggregate data. For example, we can identify the advertisements seen by each household, the deal it received, and the brands it bought subsequently. Using this detailed information, we can operationalize better measures of advertising and promotion. For example, to measure advertising, we use opportunity-to-see (OTS), which is defined as the number of exposures viewed by a household within a purchase cycle <ref type="bibr">(Lilien et al. 1992, pp. 272-274)</ref>. For further details, see the unabridged version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Empirical Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Model Selection, Cross-Validation, and</head><p>Hausman Test. We apply the proposed continuousdiscrete estimation method to estimate several alternative model specifications: dynamic model with interactions, dynamic model without interactions, price effects with interactions, price effects without interactions, diminishing returns (square-root), increasing returns (quadratic). Based on information criteria (not presented here for brevity), we retain the extended Lanchester model in ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>)it is not only parsimonious but also fits the data well for all five brands. In addition, to assess predictive validity, we conduct cross-validation using  72 observations for calibration and 12 observations for out-of-sample validation, and we find high R 2 for outof-sample forecasts across all five brands. Finally, we apply the Hausman test, find m = 10 23 and critical 2 20 0 95 = 31 41, and thus cannot reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity of advertising and promotion. We present the parameter estimates and standard errors (in parentheses) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Advertising and Promotion Effectiveness.</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> indicates that ad and promotion effectiveness vary considerably in this detergents market. Specifically, ad effectiveness of all brands, except Bold, is significant (p-values &lt; 0 05). Tide's advertising is the most effective, whereas Solo's advertising is the least effective. Similarly, promotion effectiveness of all brands, except Bold, is significant (p-values &lt; 0 05). Tide's promotion is the most effective, while Wisk's promotion is the least effective. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> also shows that all brands, except Era, exhibit negative interactions between advertising and promotion. For assessing joint significance, we test the null H 0 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 = 5 = 0 by using the likelihood ratio (LR) test. The LR statistic is 20.6, which exceeds the critical value 2 5 = 11 1 (p-value = 0 00096). Hence, we reject the null hypothesis of no interaction effects. In addition, multiple information criteria (not reported here for brevity) reinforce the finding that interaction effects exist in this detergents market. Thus, when advertising and promotion are used together, their impact on brand shares is attenuated. One interpretation of negative interaction, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mela et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jedidi et al. (1999)</ref>, is that "promotions are bad"-but not because they directly hurt brand shares. Indeed, the direct effect of promotion is positive, making it an effective marketing activity. Rather, promotion negatively moderates the impact of advertising, thereby reducing the effectiveness of advertising in building brands. Another interpretation of this negative interaction is that advertising lowers consumer sensitivity to promotion activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3.">Interaction Effects. Table</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4.">Optimal Advertising and Promotion.</head><p>We apply the proposed marketing-mix algorithm to find optimal advertising and promotion and present the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. We observe that all brands underadvertise (i.e., actual advertising is below the optimal level). In contrast, some brands overpromote whereas others underpromote. These findings are not sensitive to marginal changes in unit cost (not reported here for space constraints). Specifically, Tide and Wisk, who underadvertise, tend to promote excessively. It appears that large brands allocate fewer resources to advertising relative to promotion, a finding consistent with the notion of escalation of promotion due to managers' lack of strategic foresight <ref type="bibr">(Leeflang and Wittink 2001, p. 120</ref>). On the other hand, some small brands (e.g., Era) both underadvertise and underpromote, perhaps due to lack of resources. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.5.">Optimal Competitive Responsiveness.</head><p>Managers can gain further insights via comparative statics analyses. For example, if Tide's interaction effect increases, would Wisk respond with increased advertising or should it increase promotion? Would Solo's response differ from Tide's? Managers can answer these strategic questions by first applying the proposed marketing-mix algorithm to characterize the optimal advertising and promotion strategies for own and competitors brands, and then changing the parameter of interest (say, Tide's interaction effect), while keeping other parameters constant, to find the new optimal strategies.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> displays the comparative statics results with respect to interaction effects i for each brand i = 1 5 . Specifically, it reveals that the optimal competitive response is not symmetric. For example, based on the second column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>, when Tide's negative interaction increases, it decreases advertising and increases promotion; all other brands' follow Tide's actions. By contrast, based on the third column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>, when Wisk's negative interaction increases, it increases advertising and decreases promotion (unlike Tide's actions in column 2); other brands' follow suit, but not Tide whose best response is to decrease advertising and increase promotion. While this finding of asymmetry is new, the main point of this illustration is the ability afforded by the proposed marketing-mix algorithm for managers to gain such insights into their product markets. Thus, in practice, managers can also learn competitive responsiveness with respect to other parameters (e.g., what if ad or promotion effectiveness changes?).</p><p>Remark 4. We close by noting a useful property of this marketing-mix algorithm. Consider a typical brand manager who decides whether to promote or not in each week of the annual horizon. This brand manager then encounters 2 × 2 × 2 × • • • 52 times = 2 52 possibilities, which represents thousands of trillions of promotion plans. Brand managers cannot enumerate trillions of plans to select the best one, even with the availability of modern computers. Consequently, the determination of the "best" promotion schedule is practically impossible. Hence, it is remarkable that the proposed marketing-mix algorithm finds the optimal plan in a few minutes via the powerful concept of "switching functions" (see Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and the unabridged manuscript for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We acknowledge limitations of the model and identify avenues for future research. <ref type="bibr">Wittink et al. (1988, p. 4</ref>) make the point forcefully that, although managers have strong interest in market share, category sales may fluctuate over time. Market share models, such as the Lanchester model, ignore the fluctuations in category sales. To capture this feature, let M t denote category volume at time t so that Equation (3) becomesṠ i = M t f i t − F t S i t , where S i t is the sales of brand i i = 1 N . Then, the first-order conditions for the resulting sales game are structurally equivalent to Equations ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>). Consequently, we can apply the proposed marketingmix algorithm to obtain the optimal strategies in the presence of fluctuating category sales (see Remark 2). Thus, managers can investigate how over-or underspending changes across various patterns of category sales (e.g., seasonality).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Alternative Specifications</head><p>Another limitation of the Lanchester model is that it misses lead and lag effects for advertising and promotion. Recently, <ref type="bibr">van Heerde et al. (2000)</ref> studied the role of lead and lag effects of promotion and detected pre-and postpromotion dips in store-level data. To incorporate this feature in the Lanchester model, let u i t+ * and v i t+ * denote the lead variables and u i t− and v i t− be the lagged variables for advertising and promotion, respectively. Then, by extending (4), we obtain the marketing force f i = i u i +</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">i v i + i u i v i + K * * =1 i * u i t+ * + K =1 i u i t− , for each brand i = 1</formula><p>N , where K * and K denote the number of lead and lagged variables in the model. Note that these new regressors in the extended specification naturally (i.e., without any modifications) enter into the transition matrix k and the drift vector k via F k and f k in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">14</ref>). Consequently, managers can apply the proposed estimation method (see §4) to estimate the lead effects</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">i 1 i 2 i K *</formula><p>as well as the lagged effects</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">i 1 i 2 i K .</formula><p>To determine the optimal values of K * and K, classical information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC) can be applied for parametric model specifications. When model specification is semiparametric or nonparametric (for example, local polynomial regression; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">van Heerde et al. 2004)</ref>, then the corrected criterion AIC C <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Naik and Tsai 2001)</ref> or RIC <ref type="bibr">(Naik and Tsai 2003)</ref> needs to be applied. Thus, managers can investigate the number and nature of lead and lagged effects of both advertising and promotion in dynamic competitive markets.</p><p>Finally, our model specification misses the support variables such as features and displays, which are shown to interact with price discounts (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">van Heerde et al. 2004</ref>). While we focused on advertising-promotion interactions in order to develop general methods for estimating dynamic game-theoretic models and computing optimal strategies, we note that no new methodological issues arise in applying the dual methodology to study other interaction effects. Indeed, different model specifications would influence empirical results and yield new marketing insights. Hence, to enrich our understanding of marketing, future researchers should investigate the impact of interaction effects of support activities on optimal budgeting and allocation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Dynamic Endogeneity</head><p>We conducted the Hausman (1978) test and rejected endogeneity of advertising and promotion. Furthermore, we applied the notions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Engle et al. (1983)</ref> and reached the same conclusions (see the unabridged version). Both the approaches reinforce each other to enhance confidence and convergent validity. However, parameter estimates could still be biased due to the possibility of serial correlation causing dynamic endogeneity in advertising and promotion. Thus, future researchers need to develop statistical tests for detecting dynamic endogeneity, characterize the profit impact of such biased estimates, and recommend approaches for de-biasing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Naik and Tsai 2000</ref> for such efforts in dynamic errors-in-variable problem).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Role of Retailers</head><p>We formulated and examined an extended Lanchester game that describes dynamic competition among multiple manufacturers who incorporate strategic foresight in making intertemporal decisions for multiple marketing activities in the presence of interactions. Our analysis ignores the role of retailers. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moorthy (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Besanko et al. (2005)</ref> investigate retailers' pass-through behavior but ignore the effects of intertemporal dynamics, multiple marketing activities, and interaction effects. Future researchers could combine these strands of research by analyzing dynamic competition among manufacturers over time, among retailers, and among manufacturer-retailer dyads. This problem is not only challenging but also an important unsolved problem in marketing science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>In dynamic competitive markets, managers should recognize the presence of interactions within marketing activities and between competing brands. To this end, they should incorporate strategic foresight in their planning by looking forward and reasoning backward in making optimal decisions. By looking forward, each brand manager forecasts his own future plans and anticipates the decisions to be made by other competing brands; by reasoning backward, they deduce their own optimal decisions in response to the best strategies of all other brands. To incorporate the interaction effects and strategic foresight in dynamic oligopoly models, this paper contributes to the marketing literature by creating two methods: marketingmix algorithm and continuous-discrete estimation method. These dual methodologies enable the computation of optimal marketing-mix plans and the estimation of dynamic game-theoretic models.</p><p>We apply the dual methodologies to (a) determine the optimal budget and allocation decisions, and (b) estimate the effectiveness of advertising and promotion and their interaction effect for each of the five brands in a detergents market. We caution the readers that our empirical conclusions about over-and underspending can change under different, more realistic model specifications. Hence, managers should first fit several alternative specifications using the proposed estimation method (see §6.1) and then determine the specification to retain using appropriate information criteria <ref type="bibr">Tsai 2001, 2004)</ref>. Finally, when managers apply the marketing-mix algorithm to their specific markets, they may discover optimal marketing-mix plans that could appear different from the "business-as-usual" norm. In such situations, managers should use the resulting insights to conduct a small-scale experiment in real markets to generate further market-based evidence and to gain support from other constituencies, both internal (e.g., sales force) and external (e.g., channel members), for successful implementation of marketing-mix strategies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the Presence of Interaction Effects 26 Marketing Science 24(1), pp. 25-34, © 2005 INFORMS</figDesc><table /></figure>
