In cases where a firm has the same brand in multiple categories, existing models implicitly assume that brand equity is the same in each category. Because most firms have the same brand in multiple categories and the same brand can have different performance outcomes in different categories, these models can provide incorrect estimates of brand equity. For example, the Hewlett Packard (HP) brand is competitively stronger in the printer category, but competitively weaker in the computer server category. Moreover, approaches that assume a single-category brand do not capture the spillover effects of a brand name from one category to another (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balachander and Ghose 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Erdem 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Erdem and Sun 2002</ref>, resulting in incorrect estimates of its equity.</p><p>Current models of brand equity do not study the relationship of brand equity to advertising or shareholder value. Marketing executives need to better understand how advertising efforts are related to brand equity so that they can make appropriate decisions on advertising spending. More important, at the senior management and board of director levels, a clear understanding of the relationship of brand equity to shareholder value is critical for making appropriate marketing investment decisions and providing valuable guidance to the investors and analysts about the value of the brand to the stockholder.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a model and decision support simulator (BRAN * EQT) for estimating, track-Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 567-584, © 2008 INFORMS ing, and managing brand equity for a multicategory brand based on a combination of financial and customer-based measures. In addition, we study the relationships between brand equity and advertising and between brand equity and shareholder value. Our model is a general model with the brand in a category as the unit of analysis. It can be applied to a good or service in a business-to-consumer (B2C) or a business-to-business (B2B) context. We apply our model to measure the brand equity of the flagship brand (hereafter, "the focal brand") of Allstate Corporation, a leading insurance company (hereafter, "the company"), and its closest competitor, each of which offers its brand in multiple categories. We validate this model by comparing the relative brand importance (RBI) and brand equity obtained from a brand choice model to those from a brand perception score method. We examine the relationship between advertising and brand equity and between brand equity and shareholder value for the focal company, using data on multiple brands and categories. We discuss the implications for tracking, building, and managing brand equity based on these results.</p><p>We extend prior brand equity models in several ways. First, we extend models that treat brand equity as price or revenue premiums <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ailawadi et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Dubin 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Hjorth-Anderson 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Holbrook 1992</ref>) by incorporating cash flows that truly reflect the financial value of the brand. Second, we build on models of volume premiums based on consumer choice models estimated using scanner panel data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kamakura and Russell 1993)</ref> by including cash flows, separating the effects of multiple marketing variables, and including spillover effects across categories. Third, we go beyond models measuring marginal contribution of brands based on consumer surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Park and Srinivasan 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Srinivasan 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Srinivasan et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Swait et al. 1993</ref>) and those using brand outcomes and sources based on consumer surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Roberts et al. 2004</ref>) by incorporating cash flows and further isolating the role of brand in total cash flow. Fourth, we extend models based on expert judgments <ref type="bibr">(CoreBrand Analysis 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Interbrand 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">, Young and Rubicam 2006</ref>) by using objective financial data and consumer perception data and performing a rigorous analysis of the role of brand in consumer choice. Fifth, we extend models based on market capitalization <ref type="bibr">(CoreBrand Analysis 2004, Simon and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sullivan 1993)</ref> by rigorously separating the effects of brand from those of other variables and by basing brand equity estimation on cash flows rather than on potentially speculative investor behavior. Sixth, we go beyond single-category accounting approaches that treat investments as a measure of brand value and do not isolate the effect of brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Damodaran 2006</ref>) by using projected cash flows and consumer data and by isolating the relative importance of brand. Seventh, we extend models based on only customer survey <ref type="bibr">(Young and Rubicam 2006)</ref> and those that combine consumer choice data and financial measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fischer 2004</ref>) from single category to multicategory brand equity by including spillover effects of the brand across categories. Our model estimates RBI at the individual level, allowing the firm to segment and target customers based on its ability to leverage the brand's value. We also extend all prior models by investigating the relationship between brand equity and advertising expenditures and between brand equity and shareholder value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A Conceptual Framework and Model for Estimating Multicategory Brand Equity</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> provides a conceptual framework relating brand equity to its components, drivers, advertising, and shareholder value. In this framework, advertising impacts brand equity, which in turn affects shareholder value. Brand equity has two multiplicative components: offering value and RBI. Offering value is the net present value or financial worth of an offering (a good or service or a bundle of goods and services) carrying a brand name and can be computed based on financial measures such as expected revenues, margin ratio, and tax rate. Relative brand importance is derived from consumer brand choice and is determined by brand image and other marketing-mix elements. Brand image is driven by perceptions of several brand image driver dimensions. We focus on developing a model for estimating brand equity using financial and consumer survey data, identifying the main brand dimension drivers, and relating brand equity to advertising and shareholder value. A model that estimates brand equity would have to identify and isolate the effect of the brand image on the anticipated cash flow values of the offerings (goods or services or their combinations) carrying the brand name and determine the anticipated cash flows attributable to the brand name. To obtain an isolated effect of brand image, we need a measure that captures the contribution of brand image to consumer utility relative to those of the other attributes that also influence consumer choice of the offering. The RBI measure, explained subsequently, is an appropriate measure of the effect of brand image. For a multicategory brand, brand equity can be defined as the sum of the products of RBI and offering value in each category. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We decompose brand equity, the incremental NPV of earnings from a product or service attributable to brand image, into two multiplicative components: the discounted cash flow value that earnings from the product or service offer (offering value), and that part of the offering value attributable to the brand (RBI).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BE it = J j=1 OV ijt RBI ijt (1)</formula><p>where BE is brand equity, OV or offering value is the discounted cash flow value, RBI is relative brand importance, i is brand, j is product category, t is time, and J is the total number of product categories carrying brand i's name.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Offering Value</head><p>The offering value of brand i in category j at time t is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">OV ijt = t e f t −r it t R ijt 1−x it EBITDAMR ijt −v it dt (2)</formula><p>where f is the expected long-term inflation rate, r is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the firm owning the brand, R is the expected or anticipated average periodic revenues from the offering that carries the brand name, x is the marginal tax rate for the firm, EBITDAMR is the Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization Margin Ratio, 3 v is the firm's investment rate, and the other terms are as defined earlier. We assume that anticipated average periodic revenues can be computed based on past revenues and expected or projected growth rate of revenues.</p><p>When the time horizon is infinite, as is the case for a going concern, this offering value expression becomes the following perpetuity formula of financial valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Copeland et al. 2000, Copeland and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Weston 1988</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">OV ijt = R ijt 1 − x it EBITDAMR ijt − v it r it − f t (3)</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> provides a summary of the variables, their definitions, and potential data sources used in our model. Potential data sources and the suggested time periods for their measures are also indicated. The data on most of these variables can be obtained from company internal records and publicly available databases such as Bloomberg, Compustat, Yahoo! Finance, and Thomson Financial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Relative Brand Importance</head><p>We define RBI as the incremental choice probability of an offering that can be attributed to brand image  divided by the sum of incremental choice probabilities due to all factors-including brand image and marketing-mix variables-that drive offering choice. As we will show subsequently, RBI can also be viewed as the proportion of consumer utility derived from a brand's image over total utility for that brand. Such a variable, when multiplied by the offering value, captures the relative contribution of brand image toward the offering value estimated in the previous section. To determine RBI, we estimate it at a consumer level using a brand choice model and aggregate it across consumers. Let U ijkt denote the utility of brand i in category j to an individual k at time t. Let U ijkt comprise a deterministic component V ijkt and a stochastic component ijkt such that U ijkt = V ijkt + ijkt . Furthermore, assume that individuals maximize their utility and that the stochastic component ijkt is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to Gumbel or type I extreme-value distribution. The probability of individual k choosing brand i at time t, Pr ijkt , is given by the ubiquitous multinomial logit model of brand choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Guadagni and Little 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Erdem et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, McFadden 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Roberts and Lilien 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Roberts and Nedungadi 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Roberts and Urban 1988</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Pr ijkt = e V ijkt L l=1 e V ljkt (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where l is brand, L is the total number of brands in a given product category, and the other terms are as defined earlier. The deterministic part of the utility function, V , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">V ijkt = 0ij + X ijkt 1j + 2j Y ijkt + Z ijkt 3j (5)</formula><p>where X is a vector of the offering's attributes/ factors/marketing-mix elements, including brand image that influences consumer utility <ref type="bibr">(Dillon et al. 2001, Erdem and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Swait 2004)</ref>; Y is a variable representing past brand choice that captures the effect of state dependence or past choice or longevity of ownership on brand choice, Z is a vector of brand image scores from other categories that carry the same brand name (to capture the spillover effects of the brand from other categories); 4 and is a vector of coefficients associated with the variables. In the context of the insurance industry, it can be shown that RBI for the individual k is given by the following expression 5</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">RBI ijkt = V Bijkt V Bijkt +V Qijkt +V Pijkt +V Dijkt +V Cijkt +V Sijkt (6)</formula><p>where V B is the utility due to brand image, V Q is the utility due to product quality, and so on. B = brand, Q = quality, P = price, D = distribution, C = communication, and S = sales force are the key marketing-mix elements; that is, B Q P D C S ∈ X.</p><p>The choice of the X variables is consistent with the brand choice literature, which formulates utility primarily in terms of marketing-mix elements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Guadagni and Little 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Erdem et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Roberts and Lilien 1993</ref>. Furthermore, by including the marketing-mix decision variables, we can better separate the role of the brand in consumer choice. Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) can be further written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">RBI ijkt = Bj X Bijkt Bj X Bijkt + Qj X Qijkt + Pj X Pijkt + Dj X Dijkt + Cj X Cijkt + Sj X Sijkt (7)</formula><p>We aggregate RBI over consumers to get the RBI. In aggregating over consumers, each consumer's RBI needs to be weighted by the quantity of purchases made by the consumer. Further adjustments can be made to this expression of brand importance, if necessary, with the availability of additional relevant data or data on other relevant variables. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For each product category, we use a multinomial logit, mixed-logit, or heteroscedastic extreme value model of brand choice after determining the appropriate model through suitable tests.</p><p>Our model satisfies the considerations for valuing brand assets from an accounting perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barth and Clinch 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Barth et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Damodaran 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Kallapur and Kwan 2004</ref>. Some firms, notably European companies such as Celemi and Skandia, have used supplementary statements valuing intangible assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Celemi 2003)</ref>. Our model meets many of the considerations of accounting research for valuing intangible assets, and importantly in the United States, the Generally Accepted Accounting Practices' (GAAP) and Financial Accounting Standards Board's <ref type="bibr">(FASB 2001a, b)</ref> accounting criteria of relevance, reliability, comparability, understandability, and costeffectiveness. The model also reflects future orientation, completeness, and verifiability, which are also important characteristics of intangible assets from an accounting standpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Company Background</head><p>The company is the largest publicly held personal insurance company in the United States, with approximately $156 billion in assets under management and approximately $37 billion in market capitalization.</p><p>It sells about $29 billion worth of auto, property (home), and life insurance products and financial services to approximately 17 million households through 14,000 exclusive agencies, finance professionals and other channels, including online. About one out of every nine autos and one out of every eight homes in the United States are insured by the company. It has a huge advertising budget (several hundreds of million dollars) and was one of the official sponsors of the 2006 Winter Olympics.</p><p>Our work has important implications for the realization of the value of marketing within the company. We began this brand equity project when the company was in the throes of a marketing transformation. A new chief marketing officer was hired by the company to enable the following transformations. The view of marketing, which was equated to advertising, needed to be changed to one that encompassed the entire marketing mix. The view of the brand needed to be changed from that of brand as a symbol of an advertising slogan to that of an asset with measurable equity. Advertising needed to be treated as an investment rather than as an expense. The company wanted to fully use its position as a multicategory insurance company and not be centered on the automobile category. To enable these changes, brand equity quickly emerged as the central issue in understanding the value of marketing.</p><p>Our brand equity project is particularly important to the company not only from the perspective of enhancing the value of the company's flagship brand and making strategic decisions on advertising, but also in tangibly linking brand equity to its advertising efforts and its shareholder value. Because the insurance industry and the company's earnings are vulnerable to catastrophes such as hurricanes (e.g., Katrina) and earthquakes, from the standpoint of guiding managers, investors, and Wall Street analysts, senior management needs a tool to estimate and communicate the company's brand equity (which is more reflective of the core value of the firm than are catastrophe-dependent earnings).</p></div>

These data cover brand choice, perceptions of attributes that influence choice-including brand Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 567-584, © 2008 INFORMS image (variables contained in X and Z) and items reflecting brand dimensions. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In addition, advertising expenditures are available for the focal brand of insurance during the period from 1998 to 2005. These data are particularly useful in analyzing the relationship between brand equity and advertising expenditures. The results of such an analysis can provide important guidelines for tracking, building, and managing brand equity. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model Estimation</head><p>To determine RBI for a brand in each category, we estimate three possible choice models: a multinomial logit model, a mixed-logit model, and a heteroscedastic extreme-value model, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fischer (2004)</ref>. We select the appropriate model based on fit and interpretation of results. We first estimate the standard multinomial logit model, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref>. Next, we test for heterogeneity among consumers through fixed and random effects using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hausman (1978)</ref> test. If the test result suggests the need for controlling for heterogeneity, then we use a mixed-logit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hensher and Greene 2003)</ref>. We also test for the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption using the Hausman-McFadden test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Greene 2000)</ref>. If the IIA assumption is violated, we estimate the model using the heteroscedastic extreme-value model <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Train 2003)</ref>. We use the likelihood ratio statistics to determine if individual brand-specific constants need to be included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> provides the parameter estimates from the final brand choice model for each category for data collected in 2004. The best-fitting models for auto, property, and life insurance were heteroscedastic extreme value, multinomial logit, and multinomial logit model, respectively, based on the Bayesian information and likelihood ratio criteria, so we report the results for these models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>. The model fits are fairly good with McFadden LRIs of 0.66, 0.56, and 0.46 for auto, property, and life, respectively. The model fit is lower for the life category than for the auto and property categories mainly because the sample size is lower for life than it is for auto or property (158 for life versus 443 for auto and 441 for property). The relative importance of a particular brand in a product category can be determined once the coefficients of all the variables in the model are estimated. The coefficients for the other covariates are in the expected directions. As outlined earlier, the overall RBI of each brand in each category is computed by determining the predicted RBI for each respondent and aggregating it over all the respondents for each brand in each category.</p><p>The spillover effects of the brand from other categories to the focal category also appear in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>. The spillover effects of auto on property and life categories, and of property on the auto category, are positive and significant (p &lt; 0 05 or better). However, the spillover effects of life on the other two categories are not significant (p &gt; 0 10). Furthermore, the spillover effects of the auto brand on the other two categories are higher than the other spillover effects. The results on spillover effects suggest that sustaining and enhancing the brand is more critical in the auto category than in the other two categories.</p><p>The parameter estimates associated with state dependence (inertia) and outside good preference variables were not significant (p &gt; 0 05), so we do not report them, consistent with all insignificant effects. Inertia is likely to be high among most insurance consumers with little variance, so the inclusion of inertia or past choice in the choice model does not account for much variance in insurance brand choice across consumers. Because insurance services are almost necessary or mandatory (e.g., auto and property), outside good preference is also not significant. Thus, state dependence and outside good preference do not influence brand equity in the context of the data.</p><p>From the offering value (computed from financial data) and the RBI estimate, we calculated the estimates of brand equity for the focal brand and its closest competitor, the overall market leader. These estimates are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>. The focal brand has a multicategory brand equity of $2.928 billion, but lags behind the overall market leader which has a multicategory brand equity of $3.978 billion. The market leader has a huge lead over the focal brand in the auto category and its auto brand equity is higher than the focal brand's by about $1.32 billion. In the property and life insurance categories, however, the focal brand's equities are higher than those of the overall market leader. In the property insurance category, although the focal brand is ahead of the market leader in estimated offering value, it is behind the market leader in estimated RBI. The estimated offering value is lower for the market leader mainly because of lower cash flows due to catastrophic damages. In the life insurance category, both the market leader and the focal brand have almost the same estimated RBI, but because the focal brand has a higher offering value (due to superior cash flows) than that of the market leader, it has greater estimated brand equity as well.</p><p>The contributions of spillover effects of the auto brand to the equities of the property and life brands are about 23% and 21%, respectively, while that of the property brand on the auto brand is about 12%. These differences underscore the importance of estimating brand equity by category and across categories so that the true picture of the brand's health can be seen. Moreover, the significant differences in RBI across fairly similar product categories suggests that such differences are likely to be higher for a brand present in multiple dissimilar categories, highlighting multicategory brand equity.</p><p>We also collected data on brand perception scores for each brand on a set of 24 items on a five-point scale that extends previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaker 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Fischer 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Keller 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Young and Rubicam 2006</ref>. Based on a factor analysis of the survey data, we identified eight key brand dimensions or factors. 9 <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We could also use constrained component analysis (CCA) proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dillon et al. (2001)</ref> to disentangle ratings on general brand impressions from those on offering attributes. However, in our case, because the product attributes are already captured in the choice model, a factor analysis is more appropriate.</p><p>These are: brand reputation, brand regard, brand uniqueness, brand fame, brand trust, brand fit, brand association, and brand innovation. The correlations among the dimensions are low (0.07 to 0.22), suggesting that they measure different facets of brand image.</p><p>We carefully checked the brand dimension constructs for convergent validity (reliability) and discriminant validity, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lam et al. (2004)</ref>. We calculated the average variance extracted by the constructs and the variance shared between the constructs. The reliability of items within each construct is very high (Cronbach's Alpha ranging from 0.71 to 0.90). The discriminant validity of the measures for the constructs is also high because the variance shared between the constructs is smaller than the average variance extracted by the constructs. For example, brand trust and brand reputation are different constructs because different measurement items load on different constructs. Items f , p, and q load on brand trust, whereas items a, j, and m load on brand reputation.</p><p>Our dimensions of brand perception extend <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fischer's (2004)</ref> proposed dimensions to include brand fit, brand association, and brand innovation components. The dimensions of uniqueness, innovation, fit, regard, and reputation can be viewed as equivalent to the dimensions of differentiation, adrenaline, relevance, esteem, and knowledge, respectively, advanced by <ref type="bibr">Young and Rubicam (2006)</ref>. We also identify three additional dimensions-trust, fame, and association-offering a comprehensive set of drivers of brand image. The five-point brand perception scale is more formative than reflective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Model Validation</head><p>To validate our brand equity model, we performed several additional analyses. First, we compared the brand equity estimate from our model with that from the brand perception method-an alternative method based on self-explicated brand importance and brand perceptions obtained from the survey data. We chose  the brand perception method as a benchmark over other complex methods such as conjoint experiments because self-explicated brand perception scores do a reasonably good job of eliciting consumer preference structures and are easy to administer <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Srinivasan and Park 1997)</ref>. In this method, we first determined the general relative importance of brand in each category through a self-explicated brand importance measure.</p><p>To obtain the RBI for the focal brand, we adjusted the category-level brand importance by the overall image of the focal brand relative to other brands based on the brand image scores for each brand in each category. Although we can use the overall brand image scores for each brand, one could argue that this measure is potentially endogenous. To surmount this criticism, we use a predicted brand image score obtained by regressing the self-explicated brand image score on the brand perception dimensions. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref> shows the relative importance of the brand in the category and the means of the brand perception dimensions. The general importance of brand is highest in the life category (5.49%) and lowest in the property category (4.13%). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref> shows the results of the regression of brand image score on brand perception components. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The goodness of fit (adjusted R 2 ) for each category is high given that the data are purely cross-sectional <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hanssens et al. 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We also estimated RBI through the brand perception method using the actual brand image scores, and the results were substantively similar to those obtained by using the predicted brand image scores. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The correlations among the brand dimensions were not very high. The variance inflation factors (VIFs) were between 1.3 and 2.7, suggesting that multicollinearity is not a problem in our data.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref> provides a comparison of the results for RBI between the choice model and the brand perception score method. The RBI values obtained from these two methods are not very different, suggesting strong face validity of our proposed approach. From a theoretical standpoint, the proposed choice modeling approach explicitly considers the role of brand relative to other attributes (such as quality, service, and salesperson influence). From an empirical perspective, because both the proposed choice modeling approach and the brand perception score method provide similar estimates of RBI for the focal brand, we evaluated the predictive validity of the choice model by comparing the results from its estimation to those derived from the brand perception score method. The proposed method based on choice model outperforms the brand perception score method in each category. Therefore, we retain the proposed approach for estimating brand equity.</p><p>Second, we compare the relative positions of the focal brand and the overall market leader based on estimates of brand equity from our model and estimates of price premiums that consumers are willing to pay to stay with the chosen brand. Price premium has been used as a measure of brand equity by prior studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hjorth-Anderson 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Holbrook 1992</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> shows the average switching price premiums for the different brands in the three categories. These data are obtained directly from the consumers through a specific question in the survey that asks the respondent to report the percentage price decrease needed for the respondent to switch from her or his current brand of insurance. The price premiums are directionally consistent with the estimated brand equities, suggesting face validity for our brand equity  approach. We recognize, however, that price premium may be one component of brand equity, so this is not a strong validation test. Third, we compare the relative positions of the focal brand and the market leader based on brand equity estimates from our model and measures of loyalty toward the chosen brand, intention to repurchase the brand and intention to recommend the brand to others, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lam et al. (2004)</ref>. These brand loyalty items are measured on a five-point scale. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref> shows the average estimates of brand loyalty, which are consistent with the estimates of brand equity for different brands in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref>. The correlations of brand equity with the repeat buy and recommend measures of loyalty are positive and significantly high (p &lt; 0 01) at 0.73 and 0.92, respectively. We note that, like the price premium measure, the loyalty measures are only indicative of the directional consistency of our brand equity measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Robustness Checks</head><p>We performed several robustness checks for the proposed choice model. First, because there could be marketing-mix interaction effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Naik et al. 2006)</ref>, we tested for interactions between brand image and each attribute or marketing-mix element in the choice of a brand. The likelihood ratio tests did not reject the null hypothesis of no interactions (p &gt; 0 10) in each of the three categories. Second, we compared a  multiplicative attraction model with log-transformed variables to our choice model using nonnested model tests and found that our proposed choice model offers a better fit than alternative models (p &lt; 0 05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davidson and</ref><ref type="bibr">MacKinnon 1981, Pollack and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wales 1991)</ref>. Third, we included demographic variables as additional covariates and tested for model differences using LRTs. The tests rejected the additional demographic covariate model for auto and property categories (p &lt; 0 10). For the life category, the test was rejected at a marginal level (p &lt; 0 12), so we do not view the inclusion of demographic variables as necessary. In sum, the robustness checks showed that the proposed choice model can be used to estimate RBI fairly well for all three categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Brand Equity Driver Dimension Diagnostics</head><p>In addition to estimating brand equity, managers need to understand its driver dimensions to use them for diagnostic purposes. For example, if the focal brand equity is different from that of the main competitor brand, its managers would be interested in knowing the dimensions in which the focal brand is stronger or weaker than its rival brands. Analyses of the brand dimension scores and of the regression of brand image on brand dimensions provide such diagnostic information to managers. The perception scores in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref> vary by dimension and brand. In the auto category, the focal brand's perception scores are the highest on the brand fame (3.58) and brand reputation (3.54) dimensions and lowest on the brand fit (3.13) and brand innovation dimensions (3.15). The market leader also has high and low scores on the same dimensions. However, the market leader's average scores on these dimensions are higher than the corresponding scores of the focal brand. For example, the market leader's brand fame score is 3.66 and brand innovation score is 3.23. The patterns in the property and life categories are similar to those in the auto category; only the average  scores in the property and life categories are higher than those in the auto category.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>, brand uniqueness and brand fit are significant determinants of brand image in each category (p &lt; 0 001). For the auto and property categories, brand innovation is a significant driver of brand image (p &lt; 0 05). Brand association is significantly related to brand image for the life category (p &lt; 0 01), unlike its relationship to brand image for the auto and property categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Relating Brand Equity to Advertising and Shareholder Value</head><p>A firm's advertising efforts lower its systematic risk and may be related to its shareholder value <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McAlister et al. 2007</ref>). Advertising can preserve and enhance brand equity and shareholder value <ref type="bibr">(Keller 1993, Joshi and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hanssens 2004)</ref>. One way in which advertising could be related to shareholder value is through brand equity. To explore this link, we investigate the relationships between brand equity and advertising and between brand equity and shareholder value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Relating Brand Equity to Advertising Spending</head><p>To examine the role of advertising spending in creating brand equity, we estimate a model relating brand equity and advertising stock using advertising spending data over multiple time periods. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Broadbent (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rizzo (1999)</ref>, we first develop the advertising stock variable using a Koyck form that captures the distributed lag structure of advertising's effect as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ADS it = 1 − A it + ADS i t−1 (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where ADS is advertising stock in dollars, A is advertising spending in dollars, is the periodic advertis-ing carryover or decay rate, and t is the time period. 12 For the focal brand's advertising spending data, this formulation produced a decay rate of 0.20. We then formulate a brand equity equation, which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">BE it = 0 + 1 ADS it + 2 RMS i t−1 + it (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where RMS is the relative market share (relative to the market share leader); is an error term; 0 , 1 , and 2 are parameters; and the other terms are as defined before. For a general brand that is not a market leader, in addition to its advertising stock, its past period market share relative to the market leader may influence its equity. A greater relative market share will likely be associated with a greater role for the brand in brand choice and an enhanced ability to contribute to the cash flow. For the market leader, its relative market share could be computed with respect to the brand with the next-highest market share. We do not have a theoretical basis to expect relative market share to have any direct effect on advertising stock, so it is reasonable that relative market share is a potential exogenous determinant of brand equity.</p><p>Advertising stock could be endogenous, so we tested for its endogeneity using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hausman (1978)</ref> test. Indeed, the 2 test of exogeneity was rejected (p &gt; 0 10). Because advertising is endogenous, advertising stock could also be driven by brand equity. Therefore, consistent with , we specify a model in which advertising stock is determined by brand equity and sales growth</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ADS it = 0 + 1 BE it + 2 SG i t−1 + it (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where SG is the percentage growth rate in sales revenues; is an error term; 0 , 1 , and 2 are parameters; and the other terms are as defined earlier. A brand's advertising stock is built through sustained advertising spending. Typically, advertising spending increases or decreases with momentum in sales. The sales growth rate variable in the past period captures this momentum well. Moreover, it does not have a significant effect on brand equity . Therefore, it is reasonable to include it as an exogenous variable in the advertising stock equation. Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>) and (10) form a system of simultaneous equations that are just identified. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref> shows the two-stage least-squares estimation (2SLS) results of the brand equity-advertising simultaneous equation model for the focal brand. Although the sample size is small, the model has a high degree of fit (system wide R 2 = 0 81). More important, advertising stock is significantly positively related to brand equity (p &lt; 0 001) in the brand equity equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Relating Brand Equity to Shareholder Value</head><p>To examine the relationship between brand equity and shareholder value, we compute the correlation between the net present value (NPV) of abnormal stock market returns for the company and its brand equity. Consistent with prior event studies in finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fama and French 1993)</ref> and in marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gupta and Zeithaml 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Kalaignanam et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Sorescu et al. 2007</ref>), we use abnormal returns as a measure of stock market performance. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fama and French (1993)</ref>, we compute the monthly abnormal returns for the company owning the brand using the following three-factor model 13</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">R pt − R ft = p + p R mt − R ft + p SMB t + p HML t + pt (11)</formula><p>where R pt is the rate of return of the firm p owning the brand during month t, and R ft is the rate of return on a U.S. Treasury bond f during the same period. R mt is the average rate of return of all stocks trading on the U.S. stock market, SMB t is the difference between the rate of returns of small and big firm stocks (small minus big), and HML t is the difference in returns between high and low book-to-market stocks (high minus low), all during month t. pt is an error term, is the model intercept, and , , and are parameters associated with the three factors used in the model. We multiply the monthly abnormal returns by 12 and the market capitalization of the firm at the end of the year to obtain the change in NPV or aggregate abnormal returns for the firm in the year. We examine the correlation between the change in the firm's NPV and its brand equity predicted from the brand equity-advertising stock model. This approach is consistent with , who analyze the relationship between share price and brand equity as reported by Interbrand. The correlation turns out to be significant (0.44, p &lt; 0 05) in our data, indicating that brand equity has a positive and significant relationship with shareholder value. It could be argued that abnormal returns could also be associated with changes in brand equity. To examine this possible relationship, we computed the correlation between annual abnormal returns and changes in brand equity from the end of the previous year until the end of the current year. This correlation is also positive and significant (0.47, p &lt; 0 05).</p><p>We also computed the abnormal returns using the buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHAR) method. The BHAR method measures the difference between the compounded actual abnormal returns and the compounded predicted abnormal returns. An advantage of this method is that it better captures the compounding effect of a construct or variable change or event than many alternative approaches. A drawback of the BHAR method, however, is that it can compound errors in short-term abnormal returns and can lead to right-skewed abnormal returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kothari and Warner 2005)</ref>. Nevertheless, the results from the BHAR method for our data were similar to those from the three-factor model. Our results are consistent with the finding that corporate branding strategy (the use of the firm name across categories) is positively associated with firm performance as measured by Tobin's q <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rao et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a time plot of the focal brand's equity, advertising stock, and abnormal returns from the three-factor model and buy-and-hold method. At higher levels of advertising stock and brand equity, the abnormal returns are less volatile. Therefore, we conclude that advertising efforts are positively linked to brand equity, which in turn is positively correlated with shareholder value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Tracking and Managing Multicategory Brand Equity</head><p>Brand equity is dynamic and needs to be measured, tracked, and managed through suitable marketing initiatives, including advertising campaigns. To track brand equity and to generate answers to "what if" scenarios, counterfactuals, or policy experiments, we developed a brand equity simulator. The simulator is based on an Excel spreadsheet and takes as inputs the financial variables such as long-term inflation rate, the firm's WACC, marginal tax rate, investment rate, and EBITDA margin ratio with and without catastrophes for each product category. In addition, an executive can input the quarterly or annual projected revenues and operating costs for the brand by category. The simulator provides the upper and lower bounds of brand equity for the company's brand and the corresponding advertising spending for that period that would maintain the particular value of brand equity. Conversely, for given financial rates and ratios and a target value of brand equity, one can determine the operating profits or the advertising spending needed to achieve the targeted brand equity. The simulator offers useful managerial guidelines. First, managers can use the simulator to estimate the equity of their brands, particularly in situations where their brands are in multiple categories. Second, they can perform sensitivity analyses by exploring the impacts of financial measures such as cash flows, investment rate, and discount rate, and of survey measures such as attribute ratings. They can better estimate the return on improving specific brand equity dimensions through "what-if" sensitivity or simulation analyses of the effect on brand equity together with cost estimates of such improvements. Third, an executive can track the levels of brand equity by category over time and take suitable actions based on the changes to the equity. He or she can drill down into the components of brand equity to assess the relative effects of changes in the components. Fourth, by analyzing the relationship between advertising and brand equity and shareholder value, managers can better estimate the impact of advertising and change their advertising expenditures appropriately for desired results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Organizational Impact</head><p>Our work has had significant organizational impact along several dimensions-methodological, strategic, financial, portability, business practice, and cultural.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1.">Methodological Impact: Use of Marketing</head><p>Science Methodology Our model and the simulator have brought innovative and rigorous applications of marketing science (economic and econometric) models to the largest publicly listed company in one of the most important industries, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lilien and Rangaswamy (2002)</ref>. Although the company could have chosen an approach from a large number of alternative brand equity models, it chose our model because of its value over the other models (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and the next section).</p><p>The most innovative aspects of our approach relate to how we developed a model for estimating the equity of a brand that cuts across multiple product categories and how we implemented it. First, our brand equity model combines financial data with marketing data, and secondary data with primary data in a way that is both economically and econometrically sound. Second, our analysis goes beyond estimation of brand equity to determination of the relationships between brand equity and advertising spending and between brand equity and shareholder value. Analysis of these relationships provides managers with the diagnostics and insights into formulating effective advertising budgets. Third, our model satisfies many of the considerations of accounting research for valuing intangible assets, namely, the U.S. GAAP and FASB criteria of relevance, reliability, comparability, understandability, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the model has a future orientation and is complete and verifiable, which are also important from an accounting viewpoint. Fourth, the model captures the spillover effects of the brand from one category to another. Fifth, it enables the brand managers to identify the key dimensions that drive brand equity and take suitable actions to improve the brand's position. Sixth, in addition to being a rigorous model, it is easy to implement through the brand equity simulator. Finally, a unique feature of our model is that it accounts for the impact of catastrophes, which is critical in the insurance industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.">Strategic Impact</head><p>The estimation of brand equity from a consumer perspective-particularly, the RBI-quantified the trade-offs involved in spending on brand building, price reductions, and customer experience enhancements. Furthermore, the relative importance of the brand dimensions provided useful directions in setting brand communication objectives. In addition, the model and simulator enabled the company to determine the areas in which the company was stronger and weaker than its competitors and plan appropriate strategic actions. It has also helped the company better understand how its brand equity is derived from the auto, property, and life insurance businesses and how changes in its product mix across these categories could impact brand equity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3.">Financial Impact</head><p>The financial impact of BRAN * EQT is hard to estimate because many of its benefits will likely be realized in the long term. 14 However, one estimate of the return on investment (ROI) for the development and implementation of BRAN * EQT is more than 2,500%. This estimate is partly based on a short-term net savings of about $10 million, resulting from a reallocation of advertising budget to improve the value of the company's offerings and brand equity, after accounting for the cost of building the model and the simulator. The model supported an increase in advertising allocation of 70% for one of the categories. As a result of the reallocated advertising efforts, brand awareness increased by 18% in the first year after reallocation, although the share of advertising in the product market did not significantly increase.</p><p>The spillover effects enabled the company to redirect advertising efforts more toward the auto category than it had in the past. Furthermore, by understanding the key drivers of brand equity, the company could determine ways to improve its brand equity by about 5% and its contribution to market capitalization by 11%. The model and the simulator helped senior management reallocate fixed marketing expenses among different product categories (brand tax). An insightful financial result is that the benefits experienced by the life insurance product category or business from the company's focal brand were disproportionately greater than the marketing resource allocation it received. The long-term benefits of the model and simulator are expected to be substantial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.">Portability or Cross-Functional/Knowledge</head><p>Management Impact The BRAN * EQT simulator is truly cross-functional in that it can be used by executives from marketing, finance, accounting, and strategy. It is also portable in that the learning and best practice derived from BRAN * EQT can be leveraged to measure the equities of other brands owned by the company and outside brands that could be potential acquisitions. The model is broad, that is, it can be used for both goods and services and in both B2C and B2B contexts. Importantly, it represents a rare case of the marketing function taking the leadership and owning a strategic initiative that is scientifically and tangibly linked to the fundamental goal of the enterprise, namely, the maximization of shareholder value in the largest publicly traded insurance company. In this regard, it has the backing of the senior management team, including the senior vice president and chief marketing officer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.5.">Cultural Impact</head><p>Culturally, our model and simulator have changed the way senior management looks at the value of the company's flagship brand in four ways. First, prior to our work, the value of the brand within the company had always been fuzzy (e.g., statements such as "We have a valuable asset" or "Our brand has national or international recognition or appeal" were the common ways in which the value of the brand was articulated). Not much effort had gone toward determining the equity of this brand and how top management could use this measure to track the health of the company and improve its return on its advertising efforts and shareholder value and guide investors. Our modeling approach brought about a fundamental change in the mindset and culture of the company with regard to branding and advertising. The mindset has changed from a view of these activities as warm and fuzzy to one that considers branding and advertising as a scientific way to Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 567-584, © 2008 INFORMS leverage a key marketing asset for improving shareholder value. Second, the model has convinced nonmarketing functional executives of the value of brand and marketing in general. Third, our approach has brought accountability to senior managers because it enables them to focus on brand equity and on ways to improve it. Finally, there is a change in top managers' view of marketing as an expense to marketing as an investment.</p><p>In summary, our brand equity model and project served as a turning point for the company to rediscover the value of marketing. The model's strategic, financial, operational, and cultural impacts have been significant, and the company's marketing team is now perceived as leading the industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Some Practical Issues and Managerial Learning</head><p>We had to cross several implementation hurdles to successfully design and implement our model, leading to valuable managerial lessons. The first hurdle relates to data collection. Although the financial data for the company appear to be easiest to collect because they are internal in nature, data on variables such as EBITDAMR at a category level turned out to be challenging because it needed accurate measures of all costs, involving inputs from finance and accounting departments at different business units. Moreover, financial data for some competitors proved elusive. For example, GEICO, a competitor, is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, so its detailed financials are not available by category. Furthermore, the market leader is a mutual company, so its category-level financials are not publicly available. We learned to be prepared to triangulate from different sources to arrive at reasonable and reliable estimates.</p><p>The second problem concerns forecasting catastrophes and estimating their potential costs that go into the future earnings estimates. Although we could use past incidences of catastrophes and their financial consequences as a guide, an accurate assessment of the incidence and severity of catastrophe is difficult because even the best meteorologists' predictions are unreliable. To overcome this problem, we computed earnings estimates for different scenarios to determine the upper and lower bounds of equity.</p><p>The third problem relates to linking brand equity to advertising in an intuitive and user-friendly manner so that executives can make decisions on reallocation of advertising expenditures. Our model estimates an advertising stock and relates it to brand equity over time. The principle guiding the computation of advertising stock was not readily understood by nonmarketing executive users of the BRAN * EQT simulator tool. The simulator had to be redesigned in such a way that it provided a step-by-step account of how a change in advertising spending affected brand equity. We learned that when it comes to a decision support simulator, ease of understanding, not just ease of use, is important.</p><p>The fourth issue relates to setting up a system to track brand equity. To update brand equity estimates, the company needs to collect consumer survey data periodically. However, some team members who are involved in the data collection might get promoted or transferred to different positions in the company during the course of the year. To ensure that data collection and estimation are consistent, the company needs to follow a standard procedure. We learned that documentation of survey data collection procedure is critical to successful adoption of a brand equity model.</p><p>The fifth challenge concerns revisions to financial estimates. The simulator allows users to revise the inputs, including projected revenues and interest rates as and when they get more accurate estimates of these variables. These revised inputs may lead to changes in the levels of effective advertising expenditures. If decisions on advertising allocations and media-buying have already been made, it is not practical to change the budget. To limit this problem, the company needs to plan for flexibility in the advertising budget and media-buying decisions. The company has already moved in this direction. For the 2006 TV season, out of a total TV network advertising budget of about $100 million, the company slashed its upfront spending to $10 million from $70 million two years before <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angwin and Vranica 2006)</ref>. Thus, keeping the model and simulator flexible to receive new or revised input data is important to the success of a brand equity model and simulator.</p><p>The sixth challenge was to disentangle the cash flows attributable to the offerings carrying the focal brand name during the data period when the company acquired another small brand. With the help of the company's finance department executives, we followed a careful and systematic process of separating the cash flows by the brand based on the original accounting data. However, the cash flows associated with the acquired brand were relatively very small, so the removal of the cash flows related to this brand did not result in a significant change in the estimate of the focal brand's equity. Our key takeaway in this regard is that although the composition of cash flows needs to be scrutinized, the time spent on such an effort should be commensurate with the anticipated gains in improving the quality of the brand equity estimate to justify such an onerous task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">Limitations, Future Research, and Summary</head><p>Our approach has certain limitations that could be addressed by future research. First, our consumer survey data may contain measurement errors. Second, although the assumptions on the financial variables such as cost of capital and investment rate are fairly accurate for the company, we may not have reliable private information on these variables for the competitor firms. Third, the empirical analyses of the relationships between brand equity and advertising spending, and between brand equity and shareholder value, are based on limited sample size, so the results need to be treated with caution. Fourth, survey data were available only for a limited number of periods, so the estimates of brand equity in some periods are based partly on imputations. Fifth, the logit models did not account for error correlations across the product categories because they were low. A multivariate probit model that takes into account error correlations would be more appropriate in a general context. Sixth, the spillover effects across the categories could be based on the sequence of category purchases that may depend on customer life-cycle stage. Addressing these issues in future research may lead to a better estimate of brand equity and the discovery of more interesting relationships between brand equity and firm value.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a robust model and decision support simulator for estimating, tracking, and managing brand equity for multicategory brands based on a combination of customer survey and financial measures. To our knowledge, this is the first model to rigorously and reliably estimate the equity of a multicategory brand, capture spillover effects across categories, identify brand image drivers, and relate brand equity to advertising and shareholder value. The results of our model applied at the company show that advertising has a strong long-term positive influence on brand equity for the company. The model and the simulator are used by key executives in the company from multiple functional areas such as marketing, strategy, accounting, and finance. They have enabled the company to substantially gain by realizing the value of marketing, reallocating its advertising resources to improve brand equity and shareholder value, and offering better strategic guidance and insights to managers, investors, and analysts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Standard errors in parentheses. * p &lt; 0 10, * * p &lt; 0 05, * * * p &lt; 0 01.</figDesc></figure>
