<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Firms in many industries, including banking, education and health care, allow customers to access and manage their accounts online. Online self-service applications can save money and time for both firms and customers compared with traditional call centers or face-to-face interaction. They also allow firms to improve customer service, target new customers, and cross-sell.</p><p>Prior research suggests, however, that online applications have not fully lived up to their productivity promises <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gordon 2000)</ref>. This is in part because despite widespread Internet diffusion, customers often fail to use these services consistently <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goldfarb and Prince 2008)</ref>. For example, only 20%-25% of Italian and French online banking customers transferred money or paid bills online during the three months of an empirical study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ensor 2008, Ensor and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hesse 2008)</ref>. Sparse usage of the services' full capabilities such as online transactions reduces profits, because active users of online banking generate higher revenues for the bank even after controlling for selection effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hitt and</ref><ref type="bibr">Frei 2002, Lambrecht 2005)</ref>.</p><p>One notable feature of these technologies is that they require users to navigate a multistage adoption process. In online banking, customers often need to first sign up and then log in to the service before they can complete a transaction and ultimately become regular users. In this paper, we explore whether the multistage nature of the adoption process and the possibility of interruptions in this process can explain why customers often do not use online self-service technologies consistently. We use detailed data on individual users' completion of different stages of the adoption process of an online banking service. Our customer-level data from a German retail bank contain information on the customer's timing of sign-up for and initial login into the bank's online banking service, as well as information on subsequent usage of the platform. The setting is ideal for studying a multistage adoption process, because German banks have to comply with a complex series of security requirements that has led to a clear separation of different stages of adoption.</p><p>The presence of multiple stages to adoption allows for interruptions to the adoption process that persistently affect whether regular usage ever occurs. One possible mechanism for this effect is that learning to use and becoming familiar with the technology are costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Johnson et al. 2003)</ref>. Customers need to recall this information and behavior to move to the next stage, but if they forget, they have to relearn how Marketing Science 30(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">355-367, Â© 2011 INFORMS</ref> to use the technology. This would explain the lack of regular usage that we observe, providing a separate explanation for the usage gap from those currently proposed in the literature, which emphasize the degree of a technology's "usefulness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Davis 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Interruptions in moving through the stages of the adoption process are common: 37% of users do not log in to the service in the same month they signed up, and 29% do not conduct an online transaction in the same month they first log in. The adoption process resembles an "adoption funnel" both because of these multiple stages and the level of attrition by the end of the adoption process. Only 28% of customers who have experimented with making an online transaction continue to make at least one online transaction per month after their first transaction. If interruptions significantly affect the desired outcome-regular usage-it is crucial for a firm to manage interruptions by ensuring that customers move swiftly through the adoption funnel.</p><p>It is difficult to identify empirically a causal effect of interruptions in the initial stages of the adoption process on later regular usage. A positive relationship between customers being interrupted in the completion of the early stages of adoption and a lack of regular usage may not represent a causal relationship but instead merely customer heterogeneity such as differences in technological aptitude. Both the timely completion of the initial stages of adoption and the customer's usage decisions may therefore reflect customer characteristics that are only partially observable to the researcher.</p><p>We address this endogeneity concern by exploiting exogenous sources of interruptions to a customer's adoption process. We use variation in the number of school vacation days and public holidays across months and German states as a shifter of a customer's ability to progress through subsequent adoption stages that is unrelated to the individual customer's propensity to adopt. Vacations and public holidays affect whether customers are able to receive the initial mailing from the bank with log-in details promptly after sign-up, allowing them to complete the initial login to the website. Public holidays may at the same time counter later interruptions in the adoption process by providing customers with the option to conduct banking transactions online at a time when branch banking is not available.</p><p>We estimate a discrete choice model of the customer's decision to conduct an online transaction once he has completed the sign-up and log-in stages of the online banking adoption process. We allow the propensity of conducting online transactions to vary with the incidence of interruptions to the earlier stages of adoption. Instrumenting for interruptions with vacations and public holidays yields, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heckman (1978)</ref>, a simultaneous-equations model with endogenous dummy variables. We find a strong negative effect of early-stage interruptions on usage: an interruption of the adoption process between signup and initial log-in, or between initial log-in and the completion of an initial transaction, reduces a customer's probability of using the technology in subsequent months by 16 and 28 percentage points, respectively. This slowdown effect of interruptions on a customer's usage behavior declines with time spent in the adoption stage, providing additional evidence that we identify the causal effect of an interruption rather than underlying customer-level heterogeneity. We use the parameter estimates in rough back-of-theenvelope calculations of the magnitude of savings to the bank from being able to eradicate interruptions. These imply additional cost savings to the bank from the introduction of online banking of 6.4% if customers conduct at least one transaction through the online instead of the off-line channel. This highlights the importance to firms of actively managing the customer adoption processes to ensure that there are no interruptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Literature</head><p>Our work draws upon two literatures: research on diffusion and adoption of new technologies-in particular, where adoption involves multiple stages; and work from the psychology and consumer behavior literature on memory, learning, and momentum.</p><p>Much of the literature on technology adoption recognizes that adoption frequently involves the completion of several distinct stages (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rogers 2003)</ref> but lacks data to estimate the process with sufficient accuracy. Instead, research into the adoption of new technologies, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tellis et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Van den Bulte and Stremersch (2004)</ref>, typically treats the outcome of the individual adoption decision as a single discrete choice. Other approaches include work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kalish (1985)</ref>, who distinguishes between awareness and adoption of innovations in his theoretical model but employs only the adoption part of the model in estimation because he does not observe whether individuals are aware of an innovation. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Van den Bulte and Lilien (2007)</ref> build a model of an adoption process to derive the implicit relationship between the observed final adoption outcome and factors that affect behavior in the unobserved interim stages and exploit this theoretical relationship in estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beal et al. (1957)</ref> circumvent the unavailability of outcome data at different stages of the adoption process by collecting ex post survey data on reported behavior in these stages.</p><p>We build further on behavioral research that has explored, in other consumer-choice contexts, how delays and interruptions affect behavior. We draw on laboratory evidence from psychology on learning and memory loss that suggests that interruptions early in a given process damage recall and hinder the successful completion of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bjork and Bjork 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Richardson-Klavehn 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bjork and Geiselman 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Speier et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Speier et al. , 1999</ref>. In our setting, it is critical for customers to remember the banking website they need to navigate, its features; and their log-in details and password.</p><p>The psychology literature also points to a number of reasons for such interruptions to increase the cognitive costs of completing a new task-here, the subsequent stage in the adoption process-making it less likely for customers to engage in regular usage of the technology even if they do not abandon the service altogether. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahrick (1979)</ref> suggests that because of the lack of repeated recall early in the process, people remember less of the information and behavior relevant for the transition to regular usage, making the incremental adoption decision more costly. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schwarz (1998)</ref> finds that the perceived quality of an experience declines in the difficulty of the task, so these cognitive costs may be evaluated as particularly high if memory loss has previously led to a more difficult usage experience. Last, research points to the importance of customers having adopted an "implementational" mind-set in completing a sequence of tasks, which can be lost through interruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gollwitzer et al. 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gollwitzer 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gollwitzer , 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gollwitzer and BrandstÃ¤tter 1997)</ref>. In other words, an interruption between sign-up and evaluation or between evaluation and trial may lead customers to lose sight of their goal of conducting more transactions online. Returning to that implementational mind-set may require an additional persistent cognitive cost. In summary, we expect that in settings where adoption spans multiple stages and interruptions are common, early interruptions affect the adoption outcome because they depreciate accumulated knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data and the Online</head><p>Banking Industry We use data on the 2,130 customers who signed up for the service during the 23-month span of the data and went on to make at least one online transaction during the sample period. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For each customer, the data include the date of sign-up for online banking, the monthly number of log-ins, and the monthly number of online transactions. This means that we have data on the precise date for sign-up, but only data on the month that customers log in for the first time or conduct their first online transaction. We do not have data on other drivers of customer sign-up for online banking, such as bank-level marketing activities.</p><p>The data further include information on the number of off-line transactions that a customer conducts each month. This includes automated transactions, such as direct debits, as well as ATM withdrawals. As a result, a customer makes approximately 17 offline transactions in the average month. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The available information on off-line activity is therefore more likely a proxy for the customer's overall banking needs rather than representing the actual number of user-initiated off-line transactions.</p><p>Last, the data include several customer attributes, such as the age and gender of the primary account holder, 4 and whether a customer has a brokerage account in addition to a checking account. The data also cover the postal code of the customers' branches, which we take as their postal code of residence. We use information from Hoppenstedt Marketing Science 30(2), pp. 355-367, Â© 2011 INFORMS Firmeninformationen GmbH on the bank's number of physical branches in the local postal code.</p><p>Using official state historic records, we collect data on state-level public holidays and school vacations, which we use as instrumental variables. We calculate the length of each vacation period including weekends, as we are interested in identifying periods when people are away from home, rather than merely being off work.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides summary statistics for customer characteristics, banking usage, and vacations. Customers are located in all 16 German states. The average customer is 35.6 years old, 51% of customers are male, and 27% of customers have a brokerage as well as a checking account with the bank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Adoption Funnel</head><p>"Adoption" frequently refers to the customer's decision to purchase or begin using a product or service. For customer self-service technologies, it is difficult to identify one discrete decision that indicates adoption. In the case of online banking, the customer goes through four successive stages before the bank realizes cost savings. Our empirical measures are developed in the specific context of online banking, but the general framework applies to other self-service technologies. We call this adoption process the adoption  funnel. The different stages of the adoption funnel are as follows:</p><p>(a) Sign-up: A customer signs up for a new Internet service.</p><p>(b) Evaluation: A customer logs into the service for the first time.</p><p>(c) Trial: A customer processes the first transaction using the service.</p><p>(d) Regular usage: A customer regularly uses the service to process transactions.</p><p>Sign-up occurs when a customer submits a paper form to a bank branch indicating the wish to use online banking. The bank sends back a letter detailing the log-in ID. This system allows the bank to verify the user's identity and to transmit the log-in details securely. Creating the log-in details is automated and takes between one and two working days.</p><p>At sign-up, the customer learns three types of information: the features of the service (types of transactions that can be done online), the benefits of the service (time savings and 24/7 accessibility compared with branch services), and the actual steps involved in using the service. The customer needs to recall this information to transition to all later stages.</p><p>Evaluation occurs after a customer receives the log-in details that were sent by the bank following the sign-up stage. At evaluation, the customer logs in to the website and is able to check account details online and to investigate what the new service can do. In the evaluation stage, the customer learns new behavior. First, customers need to log in to the online banking website. This requires remembering the login ID and where they noted it down. Second, customers learn how to navigate the banking website <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Johnson et al. 2003</ref>), a potentially difficult task for an inexperienced user.</p><p>Trial occurs when customers initiate their first online transaction. Although evaluation (first log-in) and trial (first transaction) are often used synonymously, in our setting they are separated both functionally and empirically. First, a customer can log in at any time but typically has a specific need for a transaction that results in the trial of the service. Second, the separation is due to security practices that are mandated for German banks. In a mailing separate from (but simultaneous to) the mailing of the login details, the customer receives a list of six-digit transaction authorization numbers (TANs). An online transaction can only be executed if it is verified with a TAN. Trial therefore requires the customer to jump through an extra security hoop, making the customer's interaction with the online banking site more complex than at evaluation. Learning involves understanding website navigation for transactional purposes, filling out the online transaction form, and authorizing transactions. The customers need to further remember where they stored their TANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(WÃ¼bker and Hardock 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Regular usage occurs when the customer uses the technology to conduct transactions in each month. We evaluate this by studying whether, in the months after initial trial, the customer uses the technology to make transactions. Only when a customer attains regular usage can the customer and the bank fully benefit from the service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Interruptions in the Adoption Funnel</head><p>In moving to regular usage, customer learning of the online platform can be facilitated by a speedy transition through the adoption process, thereby reinforcing the memorization of newly learned information and behavior through repeated recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bjork and Bjork 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Richardson-Klavehn 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Bjork and Geiselman 1978</ref>. At the same time, the fact that adoption is not a single one-time event opens the possibility for exogenous interruptions to the process. An interruption slows movement through the adoption funnel by causing customers to forget the knowledge they previously accumulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Speier et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Speier et al. , 1999</ref>. If a vacation, for example, interrupts the adoption process after the initial sign-up, a customer may not remember the service's features, benefits, or steps required for usage upon return. A similar interruption later on in the adoption process after trial may result in forgetting how to log in or navigate the banking website.</p><p>Empirically, we consider a customer's adoption process to be interrupted between sign-up and evaluation if a customer fails to log in during the month of sign-up. The only exception to this is if sign-up was in the week prior to the end of the month (meaning that the observed delay in logging in to the website could plausibly be explained by the time it took the bank to mail the envelope). We similarly consider customers to be interrupted between evaluation and trial if they fail to conduct their first online transaction in the month of their first log-in. By this definition, a significant share of customers experience interruptions of different lengths during the adoption process. As reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, 37% of customers do not log in during the month of their sign-up, and on average, customers take 1.05 months to complete their move from sign-up to evaluation. Twenty-nine percent of customers do not conduct their first transaction in the month of their first log-in, taking on average 0.57 months to move from evaluation to trial. After customers make their first online transaction, they conduct another online transaction in only 59% of subsequent months. We explore the impact of these interruptions on regular usage of online banking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Exogenous Sources of Interruptions</head><p>We want to infer a causal relationship between interruptions in initial stages of the adoption funnel and subsequent usage. The challenge is that a positive relationship between a customer being interrupted in the completion of an early stage of adoption and a lack of regular usage may merely be the result of customer heterogeneity along a variety of dimensions, including technological aptitude, cost of time, or availability of Internet access.</p><p>To identify the causal relationship, we need a plausibly exogenous source of interruptions in the earlier adoption stages that is not correlated with the customer's unobserved attributes that lead to regular usage. We exploit the unusually regimented system of school vacation and public holidays in Germany that vary across the 16 German states. This provides an exogenous source of events that shift an individual customer's propensity to interrupt the adoption process and to move to the next stage of the adoption funnel, but are unrelated to the unobserved characteristics of that customer.</p><p>Vacation days affect a customer's ability to receive the mailing containing the online banking details and to initially log in to online banking, because they usually separate customers from their computer and their mail. This exogenous variation in computer usage caused by vacations has also been exploited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf (2007)</ref>. It implies that customers who sign up for the service in a vacationheavy month would be more likely to interrupt their adoption process and delay their first log-in than customers who sign up in another month, for reasons unrelated to unobservable customer tastes for technology. Therefore, similar customers have different likelihoods of interrupting the adoption process between sign-up and evaluation merely because they sign up in different months.</p><p>Public holidays represent an additional source of exogenous variation in whether a customer interrupts the adoption process. Similar to vacation days, they cause a delay in the customer's receipt of login details, an obvious deciding factor for whether a customer interrupts the adoption process after signup and hence delays their first log-in. However, once a customer has received both the log-in details and the TANs, there needs to be a specific reason why that customer decides to make an online transaction. One reason independent of customer-specific drivers of transaction behavior may be that, as is the case on public holidays, bank branches are closed, and consequently there are no other ways of making a transaction on the particular day. Also, customers may use public holidays to catch up with chores such as paying bills. This logic suggests that customers are more likely to make a transaction if they experience a larger Marketing Science 30(2), pp. 355-367, Â© 2011 INFORMS number of public holidays and that otherwise identical customers move through the adoption funnel at different speeds if they face different numbers of public holidays in a month. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> illustrates the extent of variation in public holidays and vacations days across customers and months. There are up to four public holidays and up to 31 school vacation days in a month, with an average of one holiday and six vacation days. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This reflects the fact that public holidays are largely set at the state level, with German states setting between 9 to 12 public holidays each year, and that the federal government coordinates the timing of school vacations to minimize overlap across states.</p><p>In estimation, we use the number of vacation days and public holidays in the 14-day window after each customer signs up for online banking as instruments for whether a customer's adoption process is interrupted between sign-up and first log-in. For example, if a customer signs up for online banking on August 14, we use vacations and public holidays that occur from August 15 to August 28. Because we only have monthly data on the timing of log-in and transactions, we use the number of vacation days and public holidays in the month following the first log-in as an instrument for an interruption between the initial log-in and the initial online transaction. The monthly data are less precise, but we were able to use the exact sign-up date to improve the precision of the instrument for an interruption before a first transaction. In cases where the first log-in falls in the same month as sign-up, we use only the public holidays in the 30-day window beginning one week after the sign-up date as an instrument for an interruption between the first log-in and first transaction.</p><p>As shown by the median splits in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, vacation days and public holidays are strong predictors of interruptions. Customers with an above-median number of vacation days or public holidays in the sign-up month have a significantly higher incidence of interruptions between sign-up and log-in than customers with a below-median number of vacation days and public holidays. Customers with an above-median number of public holidays are also significantly less likely to interrupt the adoption process between first log-in and first transaction.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reports the estimates of a linear probability model of the incidence of an interruption. Column (1) Notes. The percentage of customers who were interrupted before their first log-in or first transaction among customers with holidays or vacation days below versus above the median number of vacation days or holidays in the sample is compared. Sample: 2,130 customers who made at least one online transaction during the 23-month period. * * * Significant at the 0.001 level.</p><p>in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> displays the results of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of whether a customer experienced an interruption in the transition to log-in (evaluation stage) on customer characteristics, public holidays, and vacation days following sign-up.</p><p>The results suggest that public holidays and vacation days in the sign-up month are positively and significantly associated with interruptions, controlling for seasonality, customer demographics, and customer bank attributes. Column (2) similarly displays the results of an OLS regression of the incidence of interruptions in the transition to the first transaction (trial stage) on customer characteristics, public holidays, and vacation days in the log-in month. Vacation days are not significant here, so we did not use them as instruments in our main specification. Our ability to use the number of vacation and public holidays as instrumental variables depends on their satisfying the exclusion restriction. This requires that the instrument affects the outcome variable only through the single known causal channel. In our context, this causal channel is that prior public holidays  and vacation days affect regular usage only through earlier interruptions and not through other means. Although there are no formal statistical tests to support the exclusion of the instrumental variables from our main modeling equation of regular usage, it is important to ensure as far as possible that previous occurrences of public holidays and vacation days are independent of other factors that influence a customer's adoption behavior in later stages of adoption. For example, it would be problematic if the bank changed its marketing campaigns to match vacations or state public holidays. Conversations with the bank assured us, however, that the bank conducted such marketing efforts at a national level only. In our estimation, we also control for possible month-or state-specific factors by including seasonal and state fixed effects.</p><p>We also checked whether customers who sign up before a vacation or public holiday differ in observable attributes from the remaining customers. Our assumption that our instruments are a random treatment across customers could be violated if there are proportionally fewer customers who sign up in these periods or if the customers who do are less likely to use the Internet or are older. There are, however, no statistically significant differences in the shares of customers or in the demographic features of the customers who sign up before a vacation or public holiday compared with other times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Modeling a Multistage Adoption Process</head><p>In this section, we outline our empirical approach to estimating the determinants of a customer's decision to use online banking and how the customer's experience earlier in the adoption funnel affects this decision. We focus on the customer's decision to make at least one online transaction in a given month following the initial trial. We assume that a banking customer i who has completed the initial stages of adoption of the service uses the online banking service in month t, where t = 1 T i , provided that he or she derives positive utility from using the service. In the data, we observe only whether the customer uses the online banking service, U it , but not the underlying latent utility from doing so, U * it . We capture the benefits of using the service by a vector of customer attributes, X it . These include the number of bank branches near a customer and whether he or she holds a brokerage account (to proxy for the likely value of a physical branch location), the customer's age and gender (to reflect possible differences in cost of time across these demographic groups), and the customer's overall demand for banking services, which we approximate by the number of off-line transactions the customer makes in that month. We further include seasonal and state controls and the number of public holidays and vacation days in a month to allow for systematic differences in the attractiveness of online banking in different months or in different locations within Germany.</p><p>The costs of using the online service reflect a customer's perceived cost of returning to the website that month and reusing the service, which are cognitive costs that the customer incurs in the adoption process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Johnson et al. 2003</ref>). As we discuss in Â§3.3, cognitive costs could span learning how to navigate the banking website, remembering log-in details, and remembering where those details were stored and how to use TANs. Such learning costs likely decline as customer experience with the service grows. Accordingly, we include a vector of indicator variables, it , that reflects how long the customer has been making transactions using online banking. We include an indicator for whether a customer used the service in the last month, U i tâ1 , as a separate cost shifter; this reflects the potential for state dependence in cognitive costs. Int_Login i captures whether that customer experienced an interruption between signup and initial log-in. Int_Trans i similarly captures an interruption between initial log-in and the first online transaction.</p><p>Because customers can relearn and reengage in an implementational mind-set, the effect of Int_Login i and Int_Trans i on utility may not persist forever and instead may be most important in the initial periods where cognitive costs are highest. In our main specification, we represent this potential for the decreasing importance of interruptions flexibly with nonparametric interactions between it and the interruption indicators Int_Login i and Int_Trans i . <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We further recognize that a customer's usage decisions reflect individual-specific, unobserved shifters of the customer's utility of usage. We allow for both random customer-and month-specific shocks, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> it , to the utility from using online banking, such as random fluctuations in the amount of bills that the customer needs to pay in a given month, and persistent individual heterogeneity in the utility of usage, 3 i , that is possibly correlated with unobserved determinants of the incidence of interruptions. As in the linear probability models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we specify the likelihood of being interrupted in adoption as a function of customer attributes and, importantly, exogenous determi-Marketing Science 30(2), pp. 355-367, Â© 2011 INFORMS nants of interruptions.

Z 1 i contains, as discussed in Â§3.4, the number of public holidays and the number of school vacation days in the two-week period following the customer's initial sign-up for online banking, and Z 2 i contains the number of public holidays in the month after the customer first logs in. These are exogenous sources of variation in interruptions between sign-up and the first log-in or between the first log-in and first transaction that are excluded from the customer's subsequent usage decisions and are uncorrelated with the unobserved determinants of that decision, 3 i . The instruments allow us to identify a causal effect of interruptions on customers' regular usage that abstracts from differences in customers' underlying adoption and usage propensities as captured by i .</p><p>We assume that the unobserved customer attributes i are freely correlated and follow a mean-zero trivariate normal distribution with variance-covariance matrix [ 1 12 13 12 1 23 13 23 2 3 ]. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The correlations between i are the source of endogeneity concerns in identifying the effect of interruptions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heckman (1978)</ref> shows that under weak conditions satisfied here, all parameters of the multipleequations model are econometrically identified with the exception of the variances of 1 i and 2 i , which we normalize to one.

It also discusses the difficulty of implementing an alternative modeling approach, a simultaneous-equations-hazard specification for the time a customer spends in each stage of the funnel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> presents the results of multiple empirical specifications for the customer's repeated usage decisions. We begin with linear probability models that explore the relationship between regular usage and interruptions. Model 1 presents results from an OLS regression of the customer's usage decisions in every month after the initial trial on indicators of interruptions earlier in the adoption funnel and customer attributes.</p><p>Model 2 repeats this specification, instrumenting for the interruption variables with the number of vacations and holidays in the month following sign-up and the number of holidays in the month following the first log-in in a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation. In the systems-of-equations estimates that follow, we allow the effect of such interruptions to vary with the number of months passed since the trial. Here, we focus simply on the aggregate effect of interruptions to facilitate the interpretation of standard instrumental variable tests.</p><p>The coefficients suggest that interruptions affect customer usage in statistically and economically significant ways. In the OLS specification in column (1), the probability of conducting at least one online transaction in a given month is 10.2 and 15.9 percentage points higher for a customer who does not experience an interruption before the first log-in or the first transaction, respectively, relative to an otherwise identical customer who is interrupted. The 2SLS specification in column (2) entails a similar effect for an interruption before log-in on regular usage, suggesting that endogeneity concerns do not generally bias the results downward. The effect of an interruption before the first online transaction on regular usage increases in absolute terms under 2SLS. This may be because the measurement error introduced by our monthly data means that we include some interruptions in moving from the evaluation to the regular usage stage that are only artifacts of someone's adoption spanning the end of one month and the beginning of another month.</p><p>The specification in column (1) allows us to obtain conventional instrumental variable test statistics for the endogenous interruption variables. The Anderson canonical correlation likelihood-ratio test for underidentification suggests that we can reject the hypothesis that the first-stage equation is underidentified (p &lt; 0 0001). Our instruments are therefore good predictors of interruptions. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The remaining specifications in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> recognize both the discrete nature of our outcome variables as well as the panel nature of the usage decisions. Model 3 is a random effects probit specification of the probability of regular usage. This specification includes the effect of interruptions on transaction behavior but like model 1 does not treat interruptions as endogenous. Controlling for unobserved customer attributes with the random effects framework yields similar results to the earlier models for the effect of interruptions in significance and direction. Model 6, our main specification, controls for the possible endogeneity of interruptions using the system-of-equations estimator from Equation (1).</p><p>As above, the parameter estimates for our main model, model 6, suggest that both an interruption before the first log-in and an interruption before the first transaction significantly reduce the probability that a customer moves to regular usage. We calculate marginal effects for each individual by computing the difference in predicted marginal probability of usage if the customer has an interruption and if he does not. Across individuals, this suggests an average 15.7 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, 12.3%-19.1%) in the likelihood of a customer conducting an online transaction in the first month after making a transaction from eradicating the interruption between sign-up and evaluation, and a 28 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, 24.3%-31.7%) from eradicating the interruption between evaluation and trial. These averages compare to 37% and 29% of customers in the sample who experienced interruptions between sign-up and log-in and between log-in and the first transaction, respectively. This indicates that the effect is economically significant.</p><p>The interactions with the month dummies suggest that the impact of an interruption before the first log-in becomes very small roughly three months after the first online transaction. For the more recent interruption before the first online transaction, the impact is more persistent, and the marginal effect implies a 14.8 percentage point decrease in the probability of conducting a transaction even after nine months. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Although the marginal effects are similar to the 2SLS coefficients on average, they also suggest significant heterogeneity in the effect of interruptions with time passed.</p><p>The control variables indicate that regular usage increases at a decreasing rate in terms of the customer's age and is higher for men relative to women. These variables may proxy for customers' opportunity costs of time or computer experience. Our results also show that the availability of physical bank branches is correlated with a greater probability of regular usage, possibly reflecting the fact that banks are more likely to be present in regions with higher needs for banking. Similarly, customers with a greater number of off-line transactions who are likely to have 10 These marginal effects do not represent the marginal effects of the full interaction variable but rather the conditional marginal effects of moving from Int_Login or Int_Trans = 0 to Int_Login or Int_Trans = 1, holding fixed the particular number of months the customer has so far spent in the usage stage. We therefore focus purely on the marginal effect on the usage probability of experiencing an interruption if the customer is in months 0-3 in the usage stage, months 4-6, etc.  Our main specification also allows for state dependence in customer usage decisions by including an indicator variable for whether a person made a transaction in the prior month. As expected, the coefficient on prior usage is positive, indicating a positive association with transaction behavior over time.</p><p>The bottom panels of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> contain the parameter estimates of the remaining ancilliary equations. In line with the median splits presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, an interruption before the first log-in is positively correlated with the presence of both public holidays and vacations after sign-up. These results suggest that the more school vacation days or public holidays there are after sign-up, the more likely a person is to get interrupted in moving to initial log-in for online banking, possibly because of the increased amount of travel at these times. We find a negative and significant effect from public holidays on interruptions occurring before the first online transactions, consistent with either the increased value of online banking during times when branches are closed or with an increased focus on household tasks on public holidays.</p><p>We use the proportional chance criterion (PCC) to examine the fit of our main specification. If we classify a customer as one who conducts an online transaction in a month provided his predicted adoption probability exceeds 0.5, we correctly predict 64.02% of customers' decisions to make at least one online transaction in a month. This is statistically significantly higher than the PCC of 51.62%.</p><p>As robustness checks, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> contains in columns (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) two alternative specifications of the usage model. Model 4 jointly estimates the probability of interruptions in the initial stages and the probability of later regular usage but does not consider the effect of interruptions on regular usage. A likelihood ratio test (significant at the 1% level) suggests that the model with interruptions better reflects regular usage behavior than the alternative specification that excludes these terms. The incidence of interruptions in early stages is thus important in explaining lack of regular usage.</p><p>Model 5 shows results from a specification that omits state dependence by excluding the previous month's usage decision as an explanatory variable. The results show that if we did not account for state dependence in our main specification, we would overestimate the effect of interruptions on regular usage.</p><p>Across specifications, we thus find that interruptions both early and later in the adoption process affect regular usage. At sign-up, customers learn information that is required for the transition to all subsequent stages. Customers need to know their TANs and the different types of transactions available online in order to move to regular usage. Our results thus suggest that an interruption prior to the first log-in hurts memorization of relevant information and results in greater cognitive costs of regular usage later on, just as does an interruption immediately prior to the stage of regular usage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Policy Projections</head><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> suggest that interruptions between earlier stages in the adoption process can affect regular usage. This section provides some rough estimates of the overall effect of these interruptions on firm costs to guide firm policy. We calculate how the marginal probability of usage would change if a bank had ensured that its customers move smoothly along the adoption funnel and had prevented interruptions in the moves to the trial or evaluation stages of online banking. Before proceeding, we should note two caveats. First, we simply compare outcomes for a customer who experiences an interruption and for an identical customer who does not, rather than varying the underlying source of interruptions. Second, our estimates strictly identify only the average local treatment effect of vacations and holidays. We are therefore making an assumption that they can be considered proxies for other sources of interruptions that the bank has some control over in these estimates.</p><p>We use the estimates presented in model 6 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> describes the results for customers in the first month following their first transactions. It compares the average predicted likelihood of someone using online banking for transactions in that subsequent month if we eradicate the interruption before the first log-in, the interruption before the first online transaction, or both interruptions. All of these projections are calculated as the mean of each individual's projected difference in marginal propensity. The projections suggest that the share of customers who use online banking in that month would increase by 15 percentage points if all interruptions were eradicated. It also suggests that preventing interruptions between sign-up and log-in (a 7-percentage point increase) would have a slightly weaker effect than preventing interruptions before the first online transaction (a 9-percentage point increase).</p><p>To get a rough idea of the cost savings involved, we use estimates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">WÃ¼bker and Hardock (2002)</ref> as well as those from the bank, which suggest that replacing an off-line transaction by its online equivalent reduces a bank's variable costs by approximately  E0.50-E1.00. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We use the E0.50 figure, assuming only one transaction per month, even though the average number of transactions in our sample is 4.3 per month. A retail bank with 1 million new users of online banking such as the user base of the bank we study could therefore save at least E6 million in the first 12 months if these customers made at least one transaction online. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> suggest that the bank we study could therefore expect to see additional savings of approximately E384,000 from the increased online transactions as a result of the prevention of interruptions in the 11 months following the month of first online usage. This represents a 6.4% increase in cost savings.</p><p>Our results suggest that moving customers along the adoption funnel faster can increase the likelihood of their using the services in subsequent months. The staggered adoption process requires that managers pay particular attention to preventing interruptions and manage customers' progress along the adoption funnel. There are a number of ways to minimize interruptions to the adoption process, such as offering inbranch or online customer education on the benefits and usage of the platform, timing promotions to coincide with periods with likely interruptions, or using price incentives or deadlines to complete the adoption process or its stages. Although we do not have access to data that could assess the relative costs and feasibility of these different techniques, our results suggest value to investigating various ways of reducing interruptions in the adoption process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Online services that firms offer customers typically have a multistage adoption process. Adoption for such services can be characterized as an "adoption funnel," where customers have the potential to experience interruptions in four incremental stages: sign-up, evaluation, trial, and regular usage. The profitability of such services relies on customers successfully navigating the multiple stages and regularly using the service afterward.</p><p>This adoption funnel is vulnerable to interruptions. An interruption can lead to forgetting information and behavior previously learned and the loss of an implementational mind-set. As a result, reengaging in the adoption process may lead to significantly greater cognitive costs, preventing customers from moving to regular usage. We explore empirically how interruptions in earlier stages of the adoption funnel affect later regular usage. We use variation in interruptions resulting from differences in state-level public holidays and vacations to address endogeneity concerns. Our results demonstrate that exogenous interruptions in early stages significantly lower the probability that a customer will later regularly use the services. Interruptions can therefore partly explain low regular usage.</p><p>Our results also highlight that the extensive regulatory efforts to ensure online data security could potentially have unintended consequences for the diffusion of online services. In the case we study, the bank initiated the multiple-stage sign-up process in response to pressure by European regulators that required individual authorization for the release of personal data. To satisfy the opaque conditions for "electronic consent" of directive 95/46/EC, the bank used traditional written means to prove that the customers had consented to their data being made accessible online and developed the system of access codes (or TANs) for each online transaction. For similar security concerns, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council recommended in 2005 that banks use multifactor identification for authentication as opposed to the commonly used username/password combination. Measures to address such security concerns are not limited to the banking sector. Increasingly complicated processes to protect the security of customers have also been suggested in many industries. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Our research emphasizes that multistage authentication processes are more vulnerable to interruptions and may lead to lower levels of adoption.</p></div>

We conducted robustness checks to make sure that such customers did not bias our results and found that the exclusion of such outlying customers did not change the results significantly.4  We do not observe whether the account is a joint account but assume instead that the primary account holder manages the household's banking activities.</note>
