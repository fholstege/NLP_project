<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An outstanding problem in marketing is why some firms in a competitive market delegate pricing decisions to agents and other firms do not. This paper analyzes the impact of competition on the delegation decision and, in turn, the impact of delegation on prices and incentives. The theory builds on the simplest framework of competition in two dimensions: prices and (sales agents') effort. Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Does competition affect the price-delegation decision and, if yes, why? (2) How do prices vary under price-delegation and no-price-delegation scenarios? (3) Do the incentives to the sales representatives vary under the delegation and nodelegation scenarios?</p><p>To address these issues, we build a game-theoretic model that consists of two firms selling through their sales representatives. These representatives are company employees. Sales are a function of prices and selling efforts. The riskneutral firms decide whether or not to delegate the pricing decision to risk-averse sales representatives. The wages to the sales representatives consist of salary plus a commission on gross margins. The commission on gross margins can be adjusted, either through communicated marginal cost of production, which we call ''virtual'' marginal cost, or directly. The firm and the sales representative are assumed to have the same information about the market, that is, there is no information asymmetry.</p><p>With competition in two dimensions, the strategic nature</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction 1</head><p>Effort and pricing are involved in virtually all selling situations. Firms that employ sales personnel let them decide on the effort level required for selling the product, because the firm is unable to monitor costlessly the interaction between a sales rep and a client. Some firms let sales reps decide on the price as well. General Electric and ASEA Brown Boveri delegate pricing decisions to their sales reps in the heavy equipment industry. So do KSB, Inc. and Wallace and Tieman, Inc. in the pumps industry. However, Allen Bradely and Cutler-Hammer in the switchgear industry and Siemens and FluroScan in medical imaging do not delegate their pricing decisions. Why do some firms delegate pricing and others do not?</p><p>This paper researches the role of the incentives to delegate prices and analyzes, in turn, the impact of delegation on prices, incentives, and competition. In a model with firms competing through sales representatives, we find that under intense price competition, firms delegate the pricing decision to the sales reps. Similar findings that greater price competition enhances the incentive to delegate price setting have been reported in the survey study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Stephenson et al. (1979)</ref>. However, they did not provide an explanation for this.</p><p>The framework of this paper differs in four ways from that of the existing literature on price delegation. First, it is the first to address the issue of price delegation in a framework with competing firms. Second, delegation is explained by its strategic commitment value, not as a result of agents' superior information, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lal (1986)</ref>. Third, the demand for the products depends on the prices as well as the efforts put in by the agents. Thus, competition is on two dimensions-price and effort-and not on prices alone, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sklivas (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fershtman and Judd (1987)</ref>. Fourth, the contracts between a firm-rep pair are unobservable to the competitors.</p><p>We posit a duopoly model in which the firms sell differentiated products. The demand for the products depends on prices (which may or may not be decided by sales reps) and effort put in by sales reps. Our 1 Mathematical details for the paper are in the technical appendixes. results indicate that the strategic nature of decision variable price depends on the relative intensity of competition in the two dimensions. Even in the region in which price is a strategic complement variable and price competition is intense, firms prefer not to delegate pricing decision when the effort competition is intense. This is contrary to what one would expect when competition is in one dimension, price, in which firms adopt decentralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Moorthy 1988</ref>). In our model, the prices that the rep would set are higher than the prices that the firm sets, which leads to softening of price competition. This is attributable to the role of risk aversion of sales reps and the unobservability of contracts. With our richer framework we get results that cannot be predicted by the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McGuire and Staelin (1983)</ref> in the channels literature.</p><p>Commissions on sales volumes and on gross margins are widely observed. When we switch the commission from margins to sales volume, delegation is never optimal. With commissions on sales volume, delegation would have the effect of reps reducing price to increase unit sales and their wages. Thus, delegation leads to increased price competition. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In the next section we review related literature from marketing and economics. We develop our model in §3 and present the results of our analysis in the context of linear demand in §4. In §5 we discuss the effects of nonlinearity in demand. In §6 we discuss the results. The final section contains concluding remarks and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The issue of price delegation by a monopolist has been analyzed in the salesforce literature. Under deterministic conditions, the use of a commission that is based on a percentage of gross margin aligns the objectives of the firm and the sales rep. Therefore, price can be delegated, and the sales rep can be expected to set prices that are optimal for the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Weinberg 1975)</ref>. When the demand is stochastic, price delegation is more profitable when the sales rep's information about the selling environment is superior to that of the firm's <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lal 1986</ref>). Thus, under monopoly, the incentive to delegating price depends entirely on information asymmetries. However, we analyze a duopoly with competition in two dimensions. An empirical study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Stephenson et al. (1979)</ref>, finds various market conditions under which price delegation is more likely to be observed, but does not provide an explanation. One of the conditions identified as favoring price delegation is that of intense price competition in the market.</p><p>A second set of literature, the channels-of-distribution literature, has analyzed the issue of centralized versus decentralized decision making in intrabrand and interbrand competitive situations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Katz 1991, McGuire and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Staelin 1983)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McGuire and Staelin (1983)</ref> show that if competing firms' products are highly substitutable in demand, then decentralization is a Nash equilibrium strategy for the firms. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Moorthy (1988)</ref> shows that a necessary condition for this result is that the firms' prices be strategic complements (i.e., when the competitor reduces its price, it is beneficial for the firm to reduce its price as well). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Moorthy (1988)</ref>, firms compete on one dimension (price), and it can be determined a priori whether the decision variables are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The strategic nature of the decision variable does not change with the intensity of competition. We find here that when the competition is in two dimensions-price and effort-the strategic nature of the decision variable depends entirely on the relative intensity of competition in these two dimensions. This makes the strategic theory of delegation richer, because no longer can the actions of the firms be determined a priori to be strategic substitutes or strategic complements. Do the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">McGuire and Staelin (1983)</ref>, as extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Moorthy (1988)</ref>, apply when competition is in two dimensions? The answer is no. We find that under intense price and effort competition, even in the region in which price is a strategic complement, no price delegation is the Nash equilibrium.</p><p>A third set of literature, strategic delegation literature, focuses primarily on the choice of managerial incentive system <ref type="bibr">(Sklivas 1987, Fershtman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Judd 1987)</ref> when the agents make decisions about price (Bertrand competition) or quantity (Cournot competition). It has not addressed the issue of when to and when not to delegate price or quantity decisions. Unlike the principal-agent literature in salesforce, this stream of research assumes that demand does not depend on the effort put in by risk-neutral agents. In our model, price delegation is publicly observable and is, therefore, a commitment to allocate the decision making between the rep and the firm without making public the decisions themselves. With competition in two dimensions-price and effort-our research analyzes when it is beneficial for firms to delegate pricing decisions to their riskaverse agents.</p><p>We are addressing the issue of price delegation to sales reps when firms compete in two dimensions. We first show that with competition in two dimensions, the strategic nature of decision-variable price depends on the relative intensity of competition. With unobservable contracts and risk-averse reps, firms delegate the pricing decision when price competition is more intense. Part of the uncertainty in demand is absorbed by the firm by keeping the ''virtual'' marginal cost greater than the marginal cost of production, c. The competing firm can logically infer this through the risk aversion of the reps. Hence, under these circumstances reps would set a higher price. This is the benefit of having risk-averse sales reps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Overview of the Model</head><p>We consider two firms selling differentiated products through sales reps. The marginal cost of production, c, is constant. The demand for each firm's product (q 1 and q 2 ) depends on prices ( p 1 and p 2 ), on efforts (e 1 and e 2 ) put in by the reps, and on a common random shock, ␦. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> An increase in effort by the competing rep decreases the demand for one's own product. Because effort is not observable by the firm, it is not contractible. We consider two kinds of contracts. The first contract, when the firm delegates pricing decisions, consists of a commission rate on gross margin and a fixed-wage rate. The second contract, in which the firm does not delegate the pricing decision, consists of the price that the rep must charge in the market in addition to a commission rate and a fixed-wage rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of the Game</head><p>Although the game is modeled as a simultaneous single-shot game in which the players choose optimal strategies, there is an implied order of the play:</p><p>Stage 1. The firms simultaneously decide whether or not to delegate price. This delegation decision is observable (to the competitor) before the next stage.</p><p>Stage 2. The firms then independently decide on contracts that are not observable.</p><p>Stage 3. Reps examine the contract offered and decide whether to accept or reject it.</p><p>Stage 4. If the reps accept the contract, then each rep chooses price and effort (or only effort, as the case may be) to maximize expected utility. The prices are observable to both the firms and the sales reps.</p><p>Stage 5. The common random shock is realized; the demand for each firm's product is determined; and the commissions are paid.</p><p>The model is a Principal-Agent setup in a competitive scenario with conventional assumptions about demand, utility, and cost-of-effort functions. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991)</ref>, we adopt a linearquadratic-normal distribution parameterization. ASSUMPTION 1. The demand for firm i' s product is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q (p , e , p , e ) ϭ h Ϫ p ϩ p ϩ e Ϫ e ϩ ␦, i i i j j i p j i s j 0 Ͻ Ͻ 1, 0 Ͻ Ͻ 1, (1) p s 5</formula><p>The qualitative results do not change with uncorrelated random shock. In the common random shock scenario, there is an implicit assumption that a rep cannot be compensated based on the profits or the sales of the competitor. This is based on a realistic consideration that a firm has much better information about its profits and sales than about its competitor's.</p><p>where ␦ is the common random shock and is normally distributed with a mean zero and variance . The parameters 2 ␦ p and s are the marginal impacts on demand of a unit increase in the competitor' s price and effort, respectively. ASSUMPTION 2. The marginal cost c for both firms is constant. The values of the intercept h in the demand function and of marginal cost c are such that the expected demand is always positive in the relevant range of price and effort.</p><p>ASSUMPTION 3. The cost of effort is a convex function given by G(e i ) ϭ e . The cost is expressed in dollars. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Model Development</head><p>General wage structures consisting of salary plus commission on sales or on margins or profitability are commonly observed in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Peck 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Churchill et al. 1991</ref>. The role of these wage structures for eliciting optimal efforts in a monopoly have been analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Basu et al. (1985)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Lal and Staelin (1986)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rao (1990)</ref> under different assumptions concerning heterogeneity in selling-effort productivity, salesperson's utility function, etc. In our research, we explicitly model competition between firms that employ sales reps. Also, the competition is in two dimensions, prices and efforts. The first step is to see if this competition is any different from competition in prices alone. To address this we examine the strategic nature of price variable when there is competition in two dimensions-prices and selling effortand the wages are on unit sales or on margins. We then consider the margin-based contracts when determining the Nash equilibrium with and without price delegation. 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Price: A Strategic Substitute or a Strategic Complement Variable When Competition Is in Two Dimensions</head><p>We consider two kinds of contracts. In the first type of contract the agent is offered a contract of the form W ϭ ␣ ϩ ␤(q i ), where ␣ is the fixed salary and ␤ is the commission on unit sales. The rep makes no pricing decisions. Under this setup, the optimization problem for each firm i is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Max E (p Ϫ c)q (p , e , p , e ) Ϫ W (2a)  i i i i j j p ,␤ i i subject to e ϭ argmax[EU(W, e)] i Incentive Compatibility Constraint, EU(W, e) Ն ū Participation Constraint.</formula><p>In the second type of contract each firm offers its sales rep a contract specifying a fixed salary ␣ i and a commission rate ␤ i ϭ ( p i Ϫ y i )/( p i Ϫ c). The variable y i can be interpreted as the rep's marginal cost of production (equal to c or higher). This commission structure is equivalent to a standard form of commission on gross margin. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Under this contract the optimization problem for each firm is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Max E[(y Ϫ c)q Ϫ ␣ ] (<label>2b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">i i i y ,p ,␣ i i i subject to 2 e ∈ argmax E U((p Ϫ y )q ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) , i  i i i i i  2 E U((p Ϫ y )q ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) Ն 0.  i i i i i  LEMMA 1.</formula><p>Whether price is a strategic substitute or a strategic complement variable is determined by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 2 p (3 ϩ 8r ) Ϫ (2 ϩ 4 r Ϫ )p i ␦ p p ␦ s j 2 2 ϭ 2h ϩ 4hr ϩ (1 ϩ ϩ 4r )c.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>␦ s ␦ PROOF (REFER TO APPENDIX 1). Equation (3) allows the characterization of strategic nature, which is endogenous in our model. When the price competition is intense, as compared to effort competition ( p Ͼ s / (2 ϩ 4r )), the reaction to a decrease in price by the 2 ␦ rival firm is to decrease its own price. Thus, price is a strategic complement. However, when effort competition is intense ( p Ͻ s /(2 ϩ 4r )), price becomes 2 ␦ a strategic substitute. In the strategic substitute region, an increase in price by a competitor results in a decrease in its own demand, to which the best response is a decrease in one's own price (and, similarly, in the strategic complement region an increase in price by a competitor increases its own demand, to which the best response is an increase in one's own price). Thus, in contrast to a scenario in which price is the only decision variable, in our model, where competition is on two dimensions-price and effortprice can be a strategic substitute or strategic complement, depending on the nature of product market competition. In §6 we discuss the importance of this result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Margin-based Compensation (Plan A)</head><p>We now consider the game subsequent to the announcement by the firm of its price-delegation decision and the rep's acceptance of the contract. The equilibrium consists of the contracts offered by the firms and the price and effort levels chosen by the reps. Each firm offers its sales rep a contract specifying a fixed salary ␣ i and a commission rate ␤ i . The variable y i can be interpreted as the rep's marginal cost of production (equal to c or higher). Because the prices are observable, this wage structure is equivalent to commission on margins. By varying this ''virtual'' marginal cost of production above c, the firm can commit the rep to less aggressive behavior in a market. Because the agent is making the price decision, the firm's decision variable becomes y i . In §4.7 we consider a more complex remuneration structure and its benefits to the firm.</p><p>To determine the equilibrium delegation decision, we use backward induction that ensures that the strategy combination is a subgame perfect equilibrium. Hence, in this section we analyze the contracts between the firms and sales reps in a given delegation situation by studying the subgame subsequent to the announcement of the type of delegation-price dele-gation or no price delegation. The unobservability of contracts, commission, and salary in solving for equilibrium implies that in deciding on the contracts with the reps, the firm considers only its effect on its own sales rep's actions while regarding the competitor's contract and actions as fixed. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Reps Make Effort and Pricing Decisions</head><p>(''Price Delegation'' Subgame) Each firm, while deciding on the contract, considers the effect of the contract on its rep's actions (again, taking the actions of competing rep as given). The equilibrium contracts, prices, and efforts simultaneously solve the following maximization program for each firm:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Max E (y Ϫ c)q (p , e , p , e ) Ϫ ␣  i i i i j j i  y ,␣ i i subject to 2 (p , e ) ϭ argmax E U((p Ϫ y )q (p , e , p , e ) ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) , i i  i i i i i j j i i  (4) 2 E U((p Ϫ y )q ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) Ն 0.

Equation (4) is the incentive compatibility constraint, and Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) is the individual rationality constraint for the rep. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> From Assumption 1, the firm's profit is normally distributed. Because the rep's utility function is exponential, his expected utility can be expressed in certainty equivalent (CE ) terms as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">CE ϭ ␣ ϩ (p Ϫ y )(h Ϫ p ϩ p ϩ e Ϫ e ) i i i i p j i s j 1 2 2 2 Ϫ e Ϫ (p Ϫ y ) r .

With demand uncertainty, the risk-averse agents would set a price that is too low. However, the firm would absorb some of the uncertainty in demand by keeping the ''virtual'' marginal cost of production y i greater than c <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Mathewson and Winter 1984)</ref>. The competing firm, although it does not know the contract (because it is unobservable), can logically infer through the risk aversion of the reps that the other firm would set y i greater than c. Under these circumstances the reps would set a higher price (with y i as cost of production) than that which the firms would set (with c as cost of production). This is the benefit of having risk-averse agents. 10 PROPOSITION 1. In the symmetric Nash equilibrium under price delegation, the prices, the effort levels, and the commissions increase as the price competition becomes more intense and decrease as the effort competition becomes more intense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROOF (REFER TO APPENDIX 1B</head><p>). Prices increase with an increase in cross-price impact and so does y i . However, the increase in p i is greater than the increase in y i , and so the commission income to the rep increases as the price competition becomes more intense. This gives an incentive to the rep to put in more effort or to keep the price higher, and thereby keep the margin higher.</p><p>Rewriting the firm's payoff as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Max E[(y Ϫ c)q (␦) Ϫ ␣ ] i i i y i 1 2 2 2 ϭ (p Ϫ c)E[q ] Ϫ e Ϫ r (p Ϫ y ) , i i i ␦ i i 2</formula><p>we can see that the firm's payoff is the payoff when the firm sells directly (i.e., with no sales rep) at the same price and effort, less the risk premium that has to be given to the sales rep. When y i is set equal to marginal cost c, a small increase in y i from c has no marginal effect on the firm's profits, but has a negative effect on the risk premium to the agent, which is a gain for the firm. This private incentive, attributable to the reduction in the risk premium, makes it credible for the firm to increase y i over the marginal cost c. This is an example of the proposition put forth by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Katz (1991)</ref> that even unobservable contracts can be manipulated for strategic purposes when the agents are risk averse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Reps Make Only Effort Decision (''</head><p>No-Price-Delegation'' Subgame) Now let us consider the case in which the firm sets the retail price and the agent selects the effort level, given price and the demand. PROPOSITION 2. In the symmetric Nash equilibrium under no-price delegation, the prices, the effort levels, and the commission increase as price competition becomes more intense but decrease as effort competition becomes more intense. In either case the values of prices, the effort levels, and the commission under no-price delegation are lower than the values under price delegation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROOF (REFER TO APPENDIX 1D1</head><p>). In comparison to the price-delegation contract for the same commission rate, a firm under no price delegation would communicate a higher cost of production. However, if the ''virtual'' marginal cost of production is the same, the firm would set a lower price. This implies that the commission is lower, and that under no price delegation the rep puts in less effort. These observations may not necessarily hold true for the actual equilibrium prices and efforts, because the communicated costs of production are determined endogeneously.

Intuitively, the earlier analysis can be used here directly, because in finding the equilibrium conditions we did not assume any specific contract offered by the competing firm. Thus, in the equilibrium of this subgame, the contract by Firm 1 (y , satisfy the conditions (refer to Appendix 1C) given by Equations (1C.4) to (1C.7), simultaneously. The re-sults and sketch of the proof are given in Appendix 1D2.</p><p>Having looked at the equilibrium contracts under various cases, we can comment on the strategic role of price delegation. The firm, while deciding on the contract, must consider the effect of its delegation decision on the price and effort level offered by the competing firm's rep. Choosing a different delegation decision in effect amounts to committing to a different behavior in terms of price, effort, and commission. This commitment influences the competing firm in its contract design for its own sales rep. This is the strategic impact of the delegation decision. To complete the analysis, having worked out the subgames, we turn to the first stage of the game: the delegation decision.</p></div>

For a firm with a risk-averse sales rep facing an uncertain demand, price delegation is the equilibrium when the price competition is more intense and no price delegation is the equilibrium when the effort competition is more intense.</p><p>The delegation decision that will emerge in equilibrium is the one that is more effective in reducing competition in the dimension in which competition is more intense. Under price delegation, the rep tends to charge a higher price than what the firm would charge under no-price delegation. The firm does this by giving the rep a higher commission on gross margin. Under no-price delegation the rep has a lower commission, which reduces her incentive to provide higher effort.</p><p>In region DD\DD\NN\ND, ⌸ Ͼ ⌸ , so firms</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">DD NN 1 1</formula><p>collectively prefer price delegation.

Prices under Price-Delegation and No-Price-Delegation Scenarios We now turn to the converse issue: How does delegation affect prices and effort? Assuming that c, the marginal cost of production, is zero for both firms and h is large enough to guarantee a nonnegative demand, we plot the prices under price delegation and no-price delegation in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Note that for any given level of effort competition, as price competition increases the price of the product also increases. However, as Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows, the price under price delegation is always greater than the price under no-price delegation. When the effort competition is intense, firms prefer not to delegate the pricing decision. This helps in reducing competition in efforts. If there were to be an asymmetric equilibrium, i.e., one firm delegates the pricing decision and the other does not, the prices would vary in a different way. The firm that believes that there is greater effort competition would not delegate price, and the firm that believes that there is higher price competition would delegate the pricing decision. The firm that is not delegating price would set a lower price, and the firm delegating price would be setting a higher price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Wages under Price and No-Price Delegation</head><p>Again setting c ϭ 0, and a high value of h, we can plot the variation in wages to the sales reps with changes in price and effort competition. For any given value of effort competition, it is observed that the wage rate increases as the price competition increases. This is also true under no-price delegation.</p><p>We have shown earlier that as effort competition increases the firms move from price delegation to no-price delegation to ensure that the reps do not put in more than the desired level of effort. This is brought about by fixing the commission and not giving the rep the liberty to change the margin. On the other hand, as price competition increases, firms move toward price delegation, hoping to soften price competition. Higher commission rate on gross margins gives greater incentive to the reps to increase price. This, in turn, reduces price competition. The firm, whether adopting price delegation or no-price delegation, has to provide the rep with the same minimum utility to ensure that he works for the firm. The salary component under price delegation is reduced as a result of higher prices and commissions on gross margins. This results in higher salaries under the noprice-delegation scenario.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> shows the comparative statics under the two types of plans.</p><p>With Plan B, under no delegation and all else being equal, an increase in the commission rate is accompanied by a decrease in price and an increase in ''virtual'' marginal cost. However, the total derivative of price with respect to commission rate is zero; that is, the commission rate has no effect on pricing decision when the firm sets the price. This is because the firm can adjust the wages to the rep and its own profits by adjusting ''virtual'' marginal cost. Thus, under noprice delegation the two plans are the same. This is to be expected because what the firm can do with ␤( p Ϫ y)q it can also do with (p Ϫ y)q, with suitable recalibration of y. The salesperson is paid a dollar amount for each unit sold under either plan, and once the firm sets the price, any amount can be chosen using the simple margin Plan A. Under Plan A the firms can decrease the effort by increasing the ''virtual'' marginal cost. Thus, if the firms wanted to reduce the effort competition between reps it could do so by decreasing ␤ i under Plan B or by increasing y i under Plan A. Under no-price delegation by firms, the risk premium under Plan A and Plan B is the same. However, with price delegation, the risk premium under Plan A is higher than under Plan B. However, prices and efforts under delegation are higher with Plan A than under Plan B. Thus when price competition is higher, the increase in risk premium with Plan A is more than compensated for by the decrease in competition through higher prices and higher efforts. Hence, the profits from Plan A are greater than the profits from Plan B (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Plan A is better when keeping prices higher is important.</p><p>The delegation decision depends on the payoffs resulting from the equilibrium contract under each type of delegation decision, delegate (D) or do not delegate (N).

Yet one can expect nonlinearity in demand functions in several settings. In this section we analyze the issue of delegating the pricing decision to the sales reps when the demands faced by the firms are nonlinear. We begin with a general setup and then apply a specific functional form. Because of the functional complexity with two decision variables-price and (selling) effort-it is at times extremely difficult to obtain analytical solutions. When analytical solutions are hard to get, we use numerical techniques for the analysis. The mathematical software MATLAB is used for simulations.</p><p>Let the expected quantity sold by firm i be represented by the general form</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">E(q ) ϭ h ϩ f (p ) ϩ p ϩ f (e ) Ϫ e , (22) i 1 i p j 2 i s j</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">f Ј(•) Ͻ 0, f Љ(•) Ͼ 0 and f Ј(•) Ͼ 0, f Љ(•) Ͻ 0. 1 1 2 2</formula><p>The quantity sold decreases with an increase in its own price. The impact of a unit change in its own price on quantity sold is more at lower prices than at higher prices. Also, the quantity sold increases with the effort put in by its own rep. However, at higher levels of effort a unit change in its own rep's effort has a smaller effect on quantity, i.e., the demand equation reflects diminishing marginal returns to effort. The cross-price and cross-selling effort-demand derivatives are constant for any state of the world. This means that the sensitivity of demand for one product with respect to the other product's price and the other rep's effort is not a function of the level of demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coughlan 1985)</ref>. Because we are modeling a duopoly with similar firms, the prices and efforts by the sales reps are equal in the equilibrium. Thus, the cross-price and cross-selling effort-demand derivatives do not change with the level of equilibrium prices and efforts. We do not consider the Cobb-Douglas function because this class of constant elasticity functions is known to result in price strategies that are independent of the competitor's strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Moorthy 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Choi 1991</ref>.

Simulations are run in MATLAB to identify the regions in p s square in which profits from delegation are higher than the profits from no price delegation. For higher prices (Ͼ2,000), the profit from price delegation is almost linear (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The same is true for profits with noprice delegation. We therefore concentrate on values of prices that are below 2,000. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows that for a given low value of cross-selling effort impact ( s ϭ 0.2), the difference in profits from price delegation and no-price delegation increases as the cross-price impact increases.

For the same values of cross-price and cross-selling effort impacts the profit from no-price delegation decreases as the price increases.</p><p>To identify the equilibrium strategies we once again look at the contours ⌸ Ϫ ⌸ and ⌸ Ϫ</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">DN NN DD 1 1 1</formula><p>⌸ . These contours are shown as DN\NN and ND 1 DD\ND in Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref> for r ϭ 1 and h ϭ 100. Above 2 ␦ the curve DN\NN, the profit from price delegation is higher than the profit from no-price delegation. In the region marked (D,D) both firms prefer to delegate the pricing decision to the sales reps because this leads to softening of price competition. Below the curve DD\ND, the profit from no-price delegation is higher than the profit from price delegation. Hence, in the region marked (N, N) both firms prefer not to delegate the pricing decision to the sales reps. For low values of cross-selling effort impact and high values of cross-price impact it is optimal for the firms to delegate the pricing decision to the sales reps. The sales reps, because they now have a higher commission on gross margin, set a higher price than what the firm would have set. For higher values of prices, the delegation region expands to the right on the s axis and shifts up on p axis (becoming closer to the linear case). For lower levels of prices, the price delegation region shifts up. The nonlinear results, though not analytical, lend support to the linear demand function result that price delegation is the optimal strategy for the firms when the price competition is intense. Adopting the price-delegation strategy when cross-price impacts are high helps in softening the price competition in the market.</p></div>

This helps in reducing the price competition because the prices set by the reps are higher. The firms give their reps higher wages on margins that provide an incentive to set higher prices. It is important to keep in mind the unobservability of contract to the competing firm-rep pair. With risk-averse agents, the firm absorbs some of the uncertainty in demand by keeping the ''virtual'' marginal cost of production greater than c. The competing firm, although it does not know the competitor's contract, can logically infer through the risk aversion of the reps that the other firm would set y i greater than c. This leads to reps setting a higher price, and is the benefit of risk aversion. It is the risk aversion of reps that provides the commitment to positive commissions, which are risk sharing because they transfer risk back to the principal. This, in turn, implies a commitment to soften price competition even though the contract is not directly observed by the competitor.</p><p>When effort competition is more intense, the firms tend not to delegate. This keeps the prices lower and helps in reducing the competition in the effort dimension. In the linear demand case, when price competition is much lower than effort competition, price is a strategic substitute variable. Hence, if the competitor were to increase the price, it would result in greater effort put in by the competitor's rep, which in turn would reduce his own demand. Thus, the firm reacts by reducing its own price. This leads to a reduction in effort by its own rep, the reaction to which is lower desired effort by the competitor, and lower prices. With no delegation, the firms can raise the commissions without concern over excessive price. Thus, commission is freed up as an instrument to elicit effort. Here, unlike the decentralization in channels under intense price competition and strategic complementarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Moorthy 1988)</ref>, in the region in which prices are strategic complement variables, price delegation is not necessarily the equilibrium even when price competition is at its maximum ( p ϭ 1). Said differently, for every level of price competition there is a level of effort competition for which the equilibrium is no-price delegation.</p><p>Under the linear demand function case with both firms adopting price delegation, profits under Plan A are higher than the profits under commission on margin Plan B. Although the prices under both plans and delegation increase as price competition increases, the prices under Plan A are higher than prices under Plan B, but the risk premium under Plan A is higher. When both firms adopt price delegation, the profits to each are higher under Plan A in spite of a higher risk premium. This is because the higher prices soften price competition and the efforts by reps are higher under Plan A. When firms do not delegate prices, the two contracts are equivalent.</p><p>As the utility cost of uncertainty increases, the region of price delegation decreases because of increase in risk premium. Risk aversion and uncertainty affect the profits in two ways: directly through risk premium, and indirectly through prices and effort. The direct (negative) effect of an increase in r 2 will be greater when prices are higher and/or the ''virtual'' marginal cost is lower. In this respect, no-price delegation can be said to be more effective in providing insurance for the sales rep because it incurs a smaller cost. In the standard agency models, with no competition, providing insurance for the rep is often in conflict with providing proper incentives. However, when there is competition, firms may take advantage of this conflict to affect the strategic interaction, e.g., facilitate implicit collusion between the reps of the firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this research we have analyzed the impact of price delegation in a duopoly with competition in two dimensions: price and effort. With this richer characterization of the real world, it cannot be determined a priori whether price is a strategic substitute or a strategic complement. Under intense price competition, prices are delegated and the reps set a higher price. It is the risk aversion of reps that provides the commitment to positive commissions and the transfer of risk back to firms.</p><p>There are several interesting directions for future research. Firms need to make numerous marketing decisions besides price-for example, advertising, promotions, co-branding, product redesign, etc. In this situation, which, if any, decisions should the firms delegate to their sales reps? In a market-entry scenario, can an incumbent firm deter entry through delegation? Firms also sell multiple products that may have interrelated demand. In a multiple-product scenario how do the intrafirm and interfirm demand interdependencies affect the delegation decision? Another very interesting issue is the role of multiple reps in a firm in which decisions are made based on a bargaining process. The reps of a firm bargain (in a Nash bargaining sense) to set the optimal values of decision variables. It would be valuable to explore whether the firms can achieve a higher profit through delegation in which the reps compromise first through bargaining. Also, what incentives should the firms provide, for example, a pure profit-maximizing or a mix of profits and sales-maximizing, to affect the outcome of the bargaining process? Empirically testing the results of the analytical model would be meaningful. Higher price competition is to be expected in categories where products are perceived as close substitutes. However, there can be categories in which products are perceived to be very similar, but in which either price is not important or service provided by the sales reps is critical in making a choice. After identifying some of these categories a survey method may be employed to empirically test the results of the model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">1 2 2 2 e ∈ argmax ␣ ϩ ␤E(q ) Ϫ e Ϫ ␤ r , i i i ␦ 2 1 2 2 2 ␣ ϩ ␤E(q ) Ϫ e Ϫ ␤ r ϭ 0. i i ␦ 2</formula><p>The first-order conditions for the firm's optimization problem, after substituting for salary ␣ and effort e i , are</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">(1) (p Ϫ c) ϭ (h Ϫ p ϩ p ϩ e Ϫ e ), i i p j i s j 2 (2) (p Ϫ c) ϭ 2e ϩ 4e r . i i i ␦ Simplifying the above conditions gives 2 2 2 2 p (3 ϩ 8r ) Ϫ (2 ϩ 4 r Ϫ )p ϭ 2h ϩ 4hr ϩ (1 ϩ ϩ 4r )c. i ␦ p p ␦ s j ␦ s ␦</formula><p>Under margin-based contracts, each firm will simultaneously solve the following maximization program:</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Max E[(y Ϫ c)q Ϫ ␣ ] i i i y ,p ,␣ i i i subject to 2 e ∈ argmax E U((p Ϫ y )q ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) ,   i i i i i i 2 E U((p Ϫ y )q ϩ ␣ Ϫ e ) Ն 0.   i i i i i</formula><p>The first-order conditions for the optimization problem are</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">2 (y Ϫ c)(Ϫ1/2) ϩ r(p Ϫ y ) ϭ 0, (<label>a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_63">) i i i ␦ 2 (p Ϫ y )(1 ϩ 2r ) Ϫ E[q ] ϭ 0, (b) i i ␦ i p Ϫ y ϭ 2e .

Thus, a decentralized system is never a unique Nash equilibrium in their research.4  The terms strategic substitutability and strategic complementarity were introduced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bulow et al.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">The existence of Nash equilibrium has been checked in each subgame for the entire range of cross-price and cross-effort impacts. At the delegation decision stage, existence can be proved using bestresponse correspondence for the two firms and Kakutani's fixedpoint theorem. At the price and effort subgame the strategy sets are convex, nonempty, closed, and bounded. The utility functions are concave and so have quasiconcave contours.13  Refer to Appendix 2B for details of analytical solutions.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="16">When the reps are risk neutral, the firms do not have to pay a risk premium to the reps, so there is no inefficiency due to risk sharing. For all values of cross-price and cross-effort impacts the firms can earn the same profits with price delegation as with noprice delegation, and vice versa. Thus, with risk-neutral reps one can observe an equilibrium where Firm 1 delegates pricing decision and Firm 2 adopts no-price-delegation strategy.</note>
