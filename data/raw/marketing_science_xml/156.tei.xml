<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accounting-based approximations of Tobin's q (AATQ) are increasingly popular in marketing. AATQ differ from Tobin's original conception in that they use accounting data to assess the replacement cost of a firm's assets; the core problem with this is that valuable assets go unrecorded in external reports, including systematic underrecording of market-based assets. This research examines the extensive erroneous claims made about AATQ in marketing studies. We note the widespread use of the metrics and demonstrate that the AATQ used in marketing (1) are not comparable across industries, (2) do not use only tangible assets in their denominator, and (3) should not find equilibrium at 1. AATQ are often described as performance metrics and can respond appropriately to certain types of positive performance. Unfortunately, they also respond positively to performance-neutral strategic choices. Furthermore, whenever AATQ exceed 1, as is typical, they increase even with completely wasted investments. We note that AATQ are especially problematic measures of performance for marketers because they are biased toward reporting that investments in market-based assets (e.g., brand equity and customer satisfaction) are effective. The misuse of AATQ we document suggests the need for marketing scholars to pay greater attention to the theoretical underpinnings of their metrics.</p><p>History: Avi Goldfarb served as the senior editor and David Godes served as associate editor for this article.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Marketing scholars commonly use accounting-based approximations of Tobin's q (AATQ) and we show numerous cases where AATQ are used in marketing. However, these metrics are problematic when firms rely on market-based assets like brands. We detail incorrect assertions made about AATQ, indeed many of the justifications for the use of AATQ rely on citations to different metrics than the ones used by the marketing researchers. We demonstrate that the AATQ used in marketing (1) are not comparable across industries, (2) do not use only tangible assets in their denominator, and (3) show no theoretical reason to find equilibrium at 1. AATQ are often described as performance metrics and can respond appropriately to certain types of positive performance. Unfortunately, they also respond positively to performance-neutral strategic choices. We illustrate problems marketing scholars have overlooked in using AATQ as performance metrics, such as the considerable confusion as to whether AATQ measure past performance or future growth expectations. The key problem we note is that external reports typically do not record market-based assets; accountants underrecord such assets to guard against overstating values, which leads to higher AATQ for firms focused on marketing. This biases AATQ toward giving evidence of the effectiveness of investments in market-based assets. Furthermore, whenever AATQ exceed 1, as is the case for the average firm, the metrics increase even with wasted investments.</p><p>In this paper, we explain various versions of Tobin's q, describe a generic AATQ model, and use it to illustrate problems that stem from using accounting data as an input to Tobin's q. We note the current confusion about these metrics and what this means for the results of past research using AATQ. We argue that, given current accounting policies, AATQ should not be used as a performance metric for questions relating to marketbased assets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Use of Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q in Marketing</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> lists marketing studies using AATQ since the Journal of Marketing invigorated marketing/finance research with the 2004 special section, "Linking Marketing to Financial Performance and Firm Value" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lehmann 2004</ref>). To create this list, we searched academic databases (e.g., JSTOR, top-tier marketing journal websites, and search engines like Google Scholar)</p><p>Bendle and Butt: The Misuse of AATQ in a World of <ref type="bibr">Market-Based Assets Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 484-504, Â© 2018</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al.

It is clear that AATQ are widely used in marketing, a usage that shows little evidence of declining. AATQ are a popular way to link marketing to firm performance, as noted by <ref type="bibr">Park et al.</ref>, "Tobin's q has received wide acceptance in the current marketing literature as an appropriate measure of performance" (2013, p. 184). Marketers may have accepted Tobin's q but great confusion exists around what the AATQ used as measures of Tobin's q actually capture.</p><p>A key problem is that the denominator of the original Tobin's q-replacement cost of assets-is unknown, so AATQ employ accounting-based estimates. Unfortunately, financial accounting statements omit important assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sinclair 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Srivastava et al. 1998</ref>, which means estimates of asset replacement cost are biased downward in predictable ways, creating an upward bias in AATQ. Furthermore, as we will show, AATQ are impacted by (1) assessments of future performance, (2) historic performance, and (3) performance-neutral strategic choices. All three elements impact AATQ but have very different strategic implications. Failure to disentangle these impacts has led to misuse of the metrics.</p><p>We are not the first to note problems with Tobin's q <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dybvig and</ref><ref type="bibr">Warachka 2010, Edeling and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fischer 2016)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mizik and Jacobson (2009a)</ref> countered <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Srinivasan and Hanssens (2009a)</ref> advice to use Tobin's q, citing measurement error. We argue that, while this is true, problems with AATQ go well beyond simple measurement error. Bias gives false positives, making results easier to find using AATQ.</p><p>Prior criticism of Tobin's q has not impacted marketing's agenda. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows 11 papers using AATQ published in the last five years; JMR and JM together saw seven in 2015-2016 alone. Such research often cites papers recommending Tobin's q, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rust et al. (2004)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Srinivasan and Hanssens (2009b)</ref> (1,115 and 522 citations, respectively, on Google Scholar, November 24, 2017). Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mizik and Jacobson (2009a)</ref>, who criticize Tobin's q, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Srinivasan and Hanssens (2009a)</ref>, who largely accept the criticism, are not cited by the papers in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and have only 28 citations together. Marketing has enthusiastically embraced AATQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tobin's q and Its Variants: An Overview</head><p>Nobel Prize winning economist James Tobin introduced "q," a theoretical measure of the ratio of market value to replacement cost of a firm's assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Tobin 1969)</ref>. The usefulness of Tobin's q relies on market valuations being relatively accurate, so in this research, we adopt the assumption of market efficiency, which allows for the possibility that Tobin's q-based measures could be useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tobin's Original q Market Value Replacement Cost of Assets</head><p>.</p><p>We use a marketing definition, rather than a financial accounting definition, of an asset. Using our definition, an asset is something with economic value that currently exists. Our definition includes marketbased assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Srivastava et al. 1998</ref>) and other assets where value exists but is unrecorded. Obvious examples include most brands and customer relationships.</p><p>To relate this back to Tobin's q, consider an unknown parameter, Î¨. This parameter equals a firm's market value less its assets' replacement cost; so it captures firm value in excess of asset value. We call this market judgment, as it is driven by assessments of how effectively the firm will use its assets. If Tobin's q exceeds (is less than) 1, the market judgment about the future is positive (negative) and the firm is worth more (less) than the sum of its assets. We can rewrite Tobin's original q as follows:</p><p>Tobin's original q</p><p>Replacement Cost of Firm's Assets + Î¨ Replacement Cost of Firm's Assets .</p><p>(2)</p><p>Unfortunately, the replacement cost of a firm's assets is unknown, so scholars often use the asset values recorded in the external reports. As Erickson and Rothberg observe, "Since replacement cost is often hard to get, a common variation on the measure is to use book value of the assets" (2009, p. 162). All of the AATQ used in the papers in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> employ a variant of book value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lindenberg and Ross (1981)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berger and Ofek (1995)</ref> each suggest an AATQ. Chung and Pruitt introduce an easier approximation that became popular, as it captured 96.6% of the variance of Lindenberg and Ross' version <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chung and Pruitt 1994)</ref>. (Note the comparison to an earlier AATQ, not Tobin's original q.) Market-to-book measures have also been used as AATQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kaplan and Zingales 1997)</ref>. There are other q variants that may have different properties, as we discuss later, but in this paper we focus only on the AATQ used in marketing (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Scholars often suggest that Tobin's q is a financial or capital market metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gruca and Rego 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Anderson et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Dotzel et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Germann et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Koh et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Luo and Bhattacharya 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Luo and Donthu 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Mittal et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Nath and Mahajan 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Rao et al. 2004</ref>. Assuming market efficiency, financial metrics have the advantage of being forward looking, unlike measures based on historical accounting data. In addition, in efficient markets, financial measures adjust for risk by discounting future cash flows at a risk-appropriate rate. However, we believe that calling marketing's AATQ "financial metrics" may be misleading. We prefer the term "hybrid financial/accounting metrics," as accounting data clearly impact AATQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resolving the Confusion Around Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q</head><p>Next, we aim to resolve confusion around Tobin's q. Consider that there are two broad types of assets. The first is tangible (physical) assets. Tangible asset increases are either earned through performance (e.g., a successful development project), or arise through strategic choice (e.g., borrowing to purchase an asset). By earned increase we mean the asset arising is valued above the level of the investment. Spending $2 m to create an asset worth $3 m earns $1 m. (Similarly an earned decrease occurs when the assets are devalued.) Strategic choice describes when net assets are neither created nor destroyed. Assets are either moved around, for example, from cash to property, or come attached to an equivalent liability, for example, a property acquired with a 100% mortgage.</p><p>The second type, intangible assets, includes marketbased assets (e.g., brand equity). Intangible assets may be earned but they can also arise from (performanceneutral) strategic choices (e.g., investments in brand building that neither create nor destroy value). In this respect, intangible assets resemble tangible assets. Either asset type may be recorded or unrecorded in a firm's external reports (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Tangible assets (T) equal RT + UT and intangible assets (I) equal RI + UI, but unrecorded assets (UT and UI) are unknown. The replacement cost of assets equals the sum of all assets, RT + RI + UT + UI, but given that unrecorded assets (UT and UI) are unknown, this is hard to estimate.</p><p>Because numerous AATQ variants are used, we consider a generic AATQ for a debt-free company (the effect of borrowing will be seen later). This form of AATQ compares the market value of a firm to the value of its recorded assets. The denominator, accounting estimate of assets, equals recorded tangible plus recorded intangible assets (RT + RI). This is a biased estimate of the replacement cost of all assets, that is, RT + RI + UT + UI</p></div>

Note that market value must be positive, so market judgment cannot be more negative than the total value of firm assets, T + I + Î¨ &gt; 0, so Î¨ &gt; â(T + I).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Comparable Across Industries?</head><p>Accounting rules determine which type of tangible and intangible assets are captured in the external reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fischer 2016)</ref>. In other words, the accountants and other policy makers involved in FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) and similar bodies, when setting accounting standards, implicitly specify the proportions of each type of asset recorded, Î¸ T and Î¸ I . When an accounting rule change allows for a greater proportion of assets to be recognized-that is, Tobin's q is argued to be "comparable across firms in different industries" <ref type="bibr">(Anderson et al. 2004, p. 175)</ref>. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Germann et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Grewal et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Lee and Grewal 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Mittal et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Nath and Mahajan 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Park et al. 2013</ref> in the appendix supplies quotations showing claims made and notes our response to the claims.) The problem is that industries require different mixes of tangible and intangible assets (e.g., plant versus brand), and accounting conventions determine which types of assets are recorded. This means the most explicit justification for crossindustry comparability that we saw-"Tobin's q can be used across industries because accounting conventions do not affect it" <ref type="bibr">(Dotzel et al. 2013, p. 265</ref>)-is simply not true of the AATQ that these scholars use. Given that accounting conventions set Î¸ I and Î¸ T , Lemma 1 means that AATQ are impacted by these conventions.</p><p>To illustrate this point, we looked at the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) Index at the beginning of 2014, which gave us 373 companies after excluding firms for which a full 10 years of prior data was not available (e.g., due to launches, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and financial firms not disclosing all necessary information). We ran a variance decomposition model to assess the impact of industry on Chung and Pruitt's AATQ. The significant effect of NAICS code (z 24.06, p &lt; 0.01) suggests interindustry differences. AATQ are impacted by industry effects.</p><p>Indeed, if accountants do their jobs properly-i.e., faithfully follow accounting conventions-they will more reliably record tangible assets than intangible assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sinclair 2016</ref>) (i.e., Î¸ T &gt; Î¸ I ). This means we should expect that firms in industries that are more reliant on intangible assets should have higher AATQ, all else being equal. Let Ï be a difference in the level of tangible assets, so an industry more reliant on tangible assets will have a greater proportion of tangibles, +Ï, compared to intangibles, âÏ, ((T + Ï) + (I â Ï) + Î¨)/((T + Ï)Î¸ T + (I â Ï)Î¸ I ).</p><p>Lemma 2. If Î¸ T &gt; Î¸ I , then industries more reliant on tangible assets where Ï is greater will, all else equal, have lower AATQ than those more reliant on intangibles, dAATQ/dÏ (T + I + Î¨)(Î¸ I â Î¸ T )/((I â Ï)Î¸ I + (T + Ï)Î¸ T ) 2 is negative given Î¨ &gt; â(T + I) and a squared denominator.</p><p>We see this higher AATQ for industries more reliant on intangibles in our S&amp;P 500 data. In the first year of our data, 2004, Google's AATQ was 15.53 and <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 484-504, Â© 2018</ref> Starbucks scored 7.31. Firms less reliant on marketbased assets such as Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.</p><p>(1.37) and Honeywell (1.26) had a considerably lower AATQ. Strategy dictates asset usage so we expect predictable differences depending on firm strategy. (We will address the implications for marketing later.) Do Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Use Only Tangible Assets? Tobin's original theory seems to imply that q's denominator comprises all of the firm's assets-"the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of the firm's assets" <ref type="bibr">(Rao et al. 2004, p. 129)</ref>. AT, the old Compustat item number 120 ("total assets") typically used in the AATQ equals all recorded assets and RT + RI RT, since RI &gt; 0. However, confusion remains as to whether the denominator should constitute all assets, or just tangible assets. <ref type="bibr">Rust et al.</ref> assert that "Tobin's q is the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of its tangible assets" <ref type="bibr">(2004, p. 79, our emphasis)</ref>. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Erickson and Rothberg 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Groening et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Lee and Grewal 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Malshe and Agarwal 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Mittal et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">and Table A.2</ref> in the appendix for quotes.) Problems are especially obvious where an article's text contradicts the formula presented (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Grewal et al. 2010, p. 618;</ref><ref type="bibr">Park et al. 2013, p. 184;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2004, pp. 175, 177, and 183)</ref>. Some marketers may believe that accountants never record intangible assets, RI 0, but this is incorrect. Goodwill is a well-known recorded intangible <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goldfarb et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Lev 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Lusch and Harvey 1994</ref>. In our S&amp;P data, we found 24% of total assets recorded were intangibles, and 91.2% of our year/firm combinations reported intangibles.</p><p>Formulas using only tangible assets as their denominator have been outlined in economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hirsch and Seaks 1993</ref>). Yet these formulas are not used in any of the marketing papers in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>In fact, such approaches (which effectively downplay the importance of intangible assets) implicitly contradict the market-based assets approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Srivastava et al. (1998)</ref>, which 19 of the 33 papers in the table reference. The mere existence of these formulas in economics has bred confusion, as marketers cite properties derived from formulas in economics that they do not use in their research. <ref type="bibr">(For example, Germann et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Grewal et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Malshe and Agarwal 2015</ref> Will Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Tend to 1? <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tobin (1969)</ref> suggests that q should oscillate around 1, as market value approximates asset replacement value in the long run; marketers echo this sentiment. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rao et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Fang et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Hsu and Jang 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">and Table A.3</ref> in the appendix for details.) The prevailing logic is that if asset replacement cost is consistently higher than market value, the firm should be sold for parts, while consistently high market values should vanish in competitive markets.</p><p>Unfortunately, AATQ are consistently above 1, because assets tend to be systematically undervalued in external reports for the following reasons: (1) certain classes of assets are typically unrecorded; (2) accountants aim never to overstate, so recorded assets are conservatively valued; and (3) accounting rules typically prevent increasing asset values but encourage reducing asset values. Barring accounting errors, the proportion of each type of assets recorded, Î¸ T and Î¸ I , are less than 1. Indeed, given some asset values are recorded, RI + RT &gt; 0, AATQ will only fall below 1 when the market judgment is sufficiently negative to compensate for the underrecording of assets.</p><p>Lemma 3. Given (RT + RI)/(RT + RI) 1, the generic AATQ equals only when (UT + UI + Î¨)/(RT + RI) 0, meaning that market judgment, Î¨, must equal â(UT + UI .</p><p>There seems to be no theoretical reason for AATQ to find equilibrium at 1, that is, Î¨ â(UI + UT), but are AATQ typically above 1? We calculated Chung and Pruitt's AATQ for our sample of 373 S&amp;P 500 firms each year. The average value never falls below 1 (mean 1.81, median 1.44), even during the 2008 crash, which drastically reduced market values. The average AATQ value in the marketing research papers for which it was available was 1.6, also above 1 (t-test, p &lt; 0.001). That AATQ are consistently above 1 suggests they do not capture what Tobin originally proposed.</p></div>

This is far from perfect (the numerator includes market judgment and the denominator includes recorded intangibles but not unrecorded tangibles) but, all else equal, increasing a firm's reliance on intangible assets increases AATQ.</p><p>A significant problem arises, however, when reliance on intangibles and performance are treated as synonymous. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Groening et al. (2016)</ref> quoting prior work say that "[Tobin's q is] generally attributed to the intangible value enjoyed by the firm," (p. 65) yet call Tobin's q "a stock-market-based performance measure" (p. 64). <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sridhar et al. (2016)</ref> suggest Tobin's q can both "measure firm performance" and "changes in unmeasured intangible assets" (p. 40). Given intangible value and performance are different concepts, it is unclear how any metric can properly measure both.</p><p>Performance differs from intangible value because intangible assets are not, by their mere existence, evidence of value creation. Successful firms can earn intangible assets as they can earn tangible assets. Alternatively, managers can simply purchase tangibles or intangibles. There are many examples in marketing of purchasing intangibles; when P&amp;G bought Gillette they bought valuable intangibles, for example, the Gillette brand. Investments in brand-building advertising essentially are an attempt to purchase an intangible asset. If the brand equity created equals the amount spent, this investment is performance neutral (technically, after compensating for all relevant factors, for example, impact on a firm's risk profile). It is only when the brand equity generated is greater than the investment, for example, the advertising's cost, that this is positive performance. Similarly, when less brand equity is created than the investment, this is negative performance. In this way, an investment's impact has (1) a bought element, which we call strategic choice (i.e., the amount invested), and (2) an earned element (i.e., value created above/below the investment).</p><p>Even unsuccessful (value-destroying) investments in intangibles will typically create some assets (albeit less than the amount invested). This means that the mere presence of intangible assets is not evidence of value creation. Given that marketing investments typically purchase intangibles, equating intangible assets' existence with evidence of value creation means any empirical test of whether marketing investments create value is redundant. By this logic, marketing typically creates intangibles and intangibles equal value, so if one equates intangibles with value creation one has already assumed that marketing typically creates value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Measure Performance?</head><p>Many scholars claim that AATQ measure performance.

We suggest that many scholars do not clearly conceptualize what they mean by performance, or at least compare this to other scholar's conceptions. Across papers, AATQ are said to be doing a wide range of things that are plausibly, but imprecisely, related to performance and that contradict, without explicitly noting this, other scholars' conceptions.</p><p>Even before seeing our detailed arguments, it should be clear that no measure can perfectly capture "future growth expectations" as <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Torres and</ref><ref type="bibr">TribÃ³ (2011, p. 1092)</ref> claim, while also being able to "account for the firm's past performance," as Lee and Chen (2009, p. 103) assert. There is some logic behind the claim that AATQ measure historic performance and some logic behind the claim that they measure future growth expectations, but ultimately, we will show that AATQ are inappropriate for measuring either type of performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why Scholars Think AATQ Measure Performance</head><p>Equating AATQ with Tobin's theoretical q may explain assertions that AATQ are solely forward-looking performance metrics. Unfortunately, marketers do not use the theoretical q, and the AATQ used are impacted by factors unconnected to forward-looking performance. That said, AATQ do rise with increases in market judgment for firms with recorded assets, that is, RT + RI &gt; 0.</p><p>Lemma 4. AATQ rise with market judgment as dAATQ/ dÎ¨ 1/(RT + RI), and RT + RI &gt; 0.</p><p>Accountants underrecord assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mizik and Nissim 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Sinclair and Keller 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Srivastava et al. 1998</ref>, and the justification for AATQ as historic performance measures is that earned asset increases often go unrecorded. Any earned increase in an unrecorded intangible asset, such as customer relationships, increases AATQ. (Note a similar logic applies to unrecorded tangibles but the impact is less common.) All earned increases will be recognized by efficient financial markets, which means that whenever they are not recorded in the accounts, such increases cause AATQ to rise (for firms with any recorded assets).</p><p>Lemma 5. AATQ rise with an earned increase in unrecorded intangible assets as dAATQ/dUI 1/(RT + RI), and unrecorded tangibles as dAATQ/dUT 1/(RT + RI), given RT + RI &gt; 0.</p><p>Performance type (forward-looking/historic) differs between Lemmas 4 and 5, generating confusion about <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 484-504, Â© 2018</ref> what, exactly, AATQ measure. Yet, with both Lemmas 4 and 5, good performance corresponds with an increase in AATQ. If AATQ only responded to historic and future growth expectations, the metrics might be merely somewhat confusing. Unfortunately, performance and AATQ do not always move in the same direction. The fact that, as we will show, AATQ can increase as a result of performance negative actions can mislead us into thinking performance problems are actually evidence of performance success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How AATQ Fail to Effectively Measure Historic Performance</head><p>Consider a firm earning an increase in recorded assets; for instance, the firm makes a profit on a transaction and receives this in the form of increased cash. Clearly positive performance has occurred and the arguments for AATQ are predicated on AATQ increasing with positive performance. If AATQ are a valid measure of historic performance, one would expect an earned increase in recorded assets to increase AATQ. We will show that AATQ fall whenever UI + UT &gt; âÎ¨; the market judgment is not so negative that it outweighs all unrecorded assets.</p><p>Is the condition that UI + UT &gt; âÎ¨ a rarity? Hardlythe condition holds whenever the AATQ is above 1 (i.e., in normal circumstances). In every year that we analyzed (2004 to 2013), the average firm would see a decrease in AATQ for positive historic performance that created recorded assets. A total of 72.5% of all firm year combinations have AATQ above 1; a substantial majority of firms in any year would see an earned increase in recorded assets leading to a fall in AATQ. Lemma 6. AATQ fall rise with an earned increase decrease in recorded assets, intangible or tangible, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dAATQ dRI â UI+UT+Î¨ (RI+RT) 2 and dAATQ dRT â UI+UT+Î¨ (RI+RT) 2 if UI + UT &gt; âÎ¨.</formula><p>As internally generated intangible assets are rarely recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sinclair 2016)</ref>, the impact of an earned increase in recorded intangible assets is largely moot. It is hard to think of good examples where a firm would be permitted to increase recorded intangible assets through superior performance so we can largely ignore this.</p><p>What is not trivial is the way AATQ respond to an increase in earned recorded tangible assets. This is an everyday event for firms. For-profit firms eventually aim to generate cash, and any increase in cash arising from superior performance is an earned increase in recorded tangible assets. If AATQ adequately measure historic performance, they should rise with superior performance. However, earned increases in recorded assets often lead to a decrease in AATQ.</p><p>To visualize the problem, consider failure's impact. A firm makes a completely wasted investment: the cash is flushed down the toilet. This decision reduces recorded assets and Lemma 6 tells us that, all else equal, the average firm will see an increase in AATQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AATQ Change with Performance-Neutral Strategic Choices</head><p>Performance is an outcome (e.g., generating a profit), while strategic choices are decisions made in the hope of gaining an outcome (e.g., making an investment). A performance-neutral outcome is when an investment of $X creates an asset of exactly $X (after adjusting for any impact on risk, tax liabilities, etc.). A performanceneutral asset transfer from cash to brand is analogous to transfers between bank accounts: assets move around but their total (replacement cost) does not change. Performance-neutral choices should not predictably move a performance measure as, by definition, they do not impact performance. Yet AATQ can change with a performance-neutral choice of offbalance-sheet financing, dividend payments, depreciation policies, debt issuances, or equity structure, among other things.</p><p>Consider a firm that borrows cash; this increases recorded assets, which features on both the numerator and denominator. (For example, Chung and Pruitt's AATQ will see an increase in Debt (numerator) and an equivalent increase in Total Assets (denominator).) Even if this loan is performance neutral, meaning it has no impact on market judgment, AATQ will typically fall. A similar logic applies when purchasing recorded intangibles (e.g., borrowing to buy an established brand and recording the acquired intangible Fischer 2016). Let Î± 1 be an investment/borrowing that increases both the numerator and denominator of the AATQ, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(RT + Î± 1 + RI + UT + UI + Î¨)/(RT + Î± 1 + RI).</formula><p>Lemma 7. Performance-neutral increases in recorded assets, for example, investments financed by borrowing, lower AATQ where AATQ &gt; as dAATQ/dÎ± 1 â(UI</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">+ UT + Î¨)/(RI + RT + Î± 1 ) 2 .</formula><p>The archetypical marketing strategy choice is to increase unrecorded assets at the expense of recorded assets (e.g., to invest cash in an unrecorded brand asset). This strategy, all else being equal, has a positive impact on AATQ. To see this impact, let Î± 2 be any investment that reduces a recorded asset, such as cash, and creates an unrecorded intangible asset of equal value; by definition, this is performance neutral. The generic AATQ after the asset transfer is (RT + RI + UT + UI + Î¨)/(RT + RI â Î± 2 ), with Î± 2 0 being no asset transfer. Any performance-neutral transfer to unrecorded assets increases AATQ. The opposite also holds. A performance-neutral transfer of an </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">+ RT + UI + UT +Î¨)/(âÎ± 2 + RI + RT) 2 &gt; 0 as RI + RT + UI+UT&gt;âÎ¨,</formula><p>given the firm has positive value.</p><p>One might ask, "How can a firm decide to turn a recorded asset like cash into an unrecorded asset?" Arguably, the most common way to do so is to invest in marketing. For example, the explicit purpose of brand-building advertising is to spend cash creating an unrecorded market-based asset, brand equity. A similar outcome arises from customer acquisition spending, for example, banks giving tablets to students. These trade a recorded asset, cash, to create an unrecorded market-based asset, a customer relationship. The problem we note-that AATQ predictably rise with strategic choices-is not an obscure exception; Lemma 8 covers the heart of marketing strategy. Using AATQ risks giving false positives for marketing investments. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> summarizes why AATQ are messy measures of strategic choice, future performance, and historic performance. Changes inconsistent with a performance metric are in bold.</p><p>In summary, we argue that AATQ give false positives because of biases introduced by their use of accounting data, and so have problems measuring performance in marketing.</p><p>Why Are AATQ Especially Problematic in Marketing? <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mittal et al. (2005)</ref> observe that "[i]n extreme cases, not accounting for the replacement value of an intangible asset may result in 'overestimation' of a firm's true q" (p. 550). We suggest that extreme cases are not only when problems arise. AATQ give problems in most cases and, as outlined below, the problems are especially acute in marketing research. The topics that marketers study (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) often examine the effectiveness of investments in market-based assets, such as brand building, advertising, and customer satisfaction. Such investments transfer assets from a recorded tangible to an unrecorded intangible asset. These theoretically increase AATQ, even when the transfer is performance neutral and can increase AATQ even for wasted investments. That investments in marketing often aim to create unrecorded intangible assets and these can increase AATQ independently of performance makes AATQ poor measures of performance. In the following discussion, we show four problems especially relevant to investments in marketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A: Strategic Choices to Invest in Marketing Raise AATQ Independent of Performance</head><p>Lemma 8 tells us that transferring funds from a recorded to an unrecorded asset will increase AATQ independent of performance. Merely spending cash on advertising instead of machinery increases AATQ. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(A) shows how the impact of a performanceneutral investment on AATQ grows with the percentage of the investment that is in marketing (i.e., unrecorded) assets. To create this figure, we assume that the firm has an average AATQ (e.g., 1.6), that the firm makes marketing investments that create unrecorded assets while any alternative investments create recorded assets, and the investment is 10% of the replacement cost of the firm's assets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B: Problems Are More Likely to Occur When Considering Marketing-Focused Firms</head><p>As marketing-focused firms focus on less reliably recorded intangible assets, such firms will have relatively high AATQ compared to other firms at the same level of market judgment (Lemma 2). This means that there is a range of market judgment that would see marketing-focused firms have AATQ &gt; 1, but nonmarketing-focused firms have AATQ &lt; 1. AATQ have the wrong sign for a performance measure when AATQ &gt; 1 (Lemma 6), meaning that in the specified range, AATQ rise with wasted investments only for marketing-focused firms (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(B)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C: Market Judgment Would Have to Overreact to Compensate for Marketers' Wasted Spending</head><p>Investment failures not only waste funds, but may convey information about the firm's future prospects. One might conjecture that a decrease in market judgment could offset any increase in AATQ from wasted investments; this may be true but it does not address the bias in AATQ. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(C) shows the drop in market judgment necessary to stop a firm's AATQ from rising after a wasted investment, depending on the percentage of assets that are marketing assets. Consider a firm making a recorded negative tangible investment versus a similarly negative unrecorded intangible investment. The investment is Î± 3 , which is less than all recorded assets, Î± 3 &lt; TÎ¸ T + IÎ¸ I . The benefit is Î², and Î± 3 &gt; Î² &gt; 0, given that the investment is performance negative. AATQ after a recorded tangible and unrecorded intangible asset investment are, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Î¨ + I(1 â Î¸ I ) + T(1 â Î¸ T ) + TÎ¸ T + IÎ¸ I â Î± 3 + Î² TÎ¸ T + IÎ¸ I â Î± 3 + Î² ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Î¨ + I(1 â Î¸ I ) + T(1 â Î¸ T ) + TÎ¸ T + IÎ¸ I â Î± 3 + Î² TÎ¸ T + IÎ¸ I â Î± 3 .</formula><p>AATQ after the intangible investment are higher by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">âÎ²(T + I â Î± 3 + Î² + Î¨) (Î± 3 â (IÎ¸ I + TÎ¸ T ))(âÎ± 3 + Î² + IÎ¸ i + TÎ¸ T )</formula><p>, which is greater than 0.</p><p>For AATQ not to increase in response to a failed investment, one must presume that the market will "overreact" and punish marketing-focused firms more (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(C)). This overreaction would mean that marketing-focused firms would become predictably "undervalued" (relative to their assets) after a failed investment. This is hard to reconcile with the efficient market assumption underpinning the core argument for using Tobin's q.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D: Bias Toward Marketing-Focused Firms Increases with More Effective Investments</head><p>Bias in AATQ is especially significant when investments are effective. Let Î³ &gt; 0 equal a given firm's earned increase in either a recorded tangible or an unrecorded intangible asset. Starting at the same AATQ, the difference in AATQ at period 2 after these two earned increases is AATQ Tangible â AATQ Intangible DIFF â(Î³(I + T + Î³ + Î¨))/((IÎ¸ I + TÎ¸ T )(Î³ + IÎ¸ I + TÎ¸ T )). AATQ after the unrecorded intangible investment are larger, as Î¨ &gt; â(I + T), while I, T, Î³, Î¸ T , and Î¸ I are nonnegative.</p><p>Now consider what happens to this difference with increasing success, Î³ â,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">dDIFF/dÎ³ â1/(IÎ¸ I + TÎ¸ T ) + (âI(1 â Î¸ I ) + T(1 â Î¸ T ) + Î¨)/(Î³ + IÎ¸ I + TÎ¸ T ) 2 .</formula><p>The change in this difference from increasing effectiveness is negative, given the conditions immediately above, and Î¸ T &lt; 1, Î¸ I &lt; 1. Therefore, the difference between the tangible and intangible investment's impact on AATQ increases with the success of the investment. Figure 1(D) illustrates, starting at an average AATQ, how the difference in AATQ between a marketing (asset unrecorded) and other investment (asset recorded) increases when the earned asset increase is greater. When comparing two equally successful investments, the more successful the investments are, the greater the bias in favor of the marketing-focused company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AATQ Related Empirical Findings in Marketing Scholarship</head><p>Could bias have impacted marketing scholarship? Note that we are not arguing that any specific result is invalid, but that using an AATQ often allows for a plausible alternative hypothesis-the results are artifacts of the metric used. Given that marketers typically use only a single dependent variable, it is hard to spot bias. Furthermore, results from studies using alternative metrics predicted to be weaker would, presumably, have remained unpublished. This means we cannot use a formal test to examine if bias impacts prior findings, yet we can review if this is plausible. To see if it is plausible that bias has impacted marketing scholarship, we sought insights related to AATQ bias by examining marketing papers in the FT 50 journals from 2004 using an AATQ, or addressing similar questions with market value metrics free of accounting estimates, for example, stock return. (Note the insights we examined were not necessarily those central to the original study.) We excluded papers that examined mispricing/stock market inefficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aksoy et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Fornell et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Ittner et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Jacobson and Mizik 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Luo and Homburg 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Luo et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Raithel et al. 2012</ref>.</p><p>We make no conclusive claim, merely noting findings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>) of published papers in the customer satisfaction, advertising/communications, and the wider marketing literature are broadly consistent with our theory. AATQ typically record stronger effects than alternative metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer Satisfaction</head><p>Theoretically, the connection between achieved customer satisfaction and market-based assets seems strong. Market-based assets are valuable so firms with higher satisfaction should, all else equal, have higher value. AATQ, and other market value related metrics, should increase for firms earning an increase in an unrecorded customer satisfaction asset. Pursuing satisfaction however may or may not represent a good investment. If the strategy is successful, we would expect AATQs and market value metrics that do not use accounting data to increase. For a performance-neutral transfer from a recorded to an unrecorded asset, for example, cash to customer satisfaction, AATQ will increase (Lemma 7) with no change in other metrics. Failed satisfaction investments make other metrics fall but will often increase AATQ (Lemma 8). Overall AATQs have a bias to overreport the value of a strategy that pursues satisfaction (or other unrecorded intangibles). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al. (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gruca and Rego (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Luo and Homburg (2007)</ref> showed-consistent with it being a market-based asset-that achieved customer satisfaction is associated with higher AATQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mittal et al. (2005)</ref> find that customer satisfaction is significantly associated with an AATQ across all models but the relationship with Annualized Stock Return is much weaker, going away when controlling for firm efficiency. They assert that AATQ captures the long-term impact, and Annualized Stock Return captures the short-term impact. An alternative hypothesis is that the results are due to the AATQ's bias. Consistent with our theory, a marketing strategy's link to performance is stronger when performance is measured by an AATQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Morgan and Rego (2006)</ref> examined the relationship between performance and six satisfaction metrics derived from ACSI data. Four significantly predicted the AATQ but only one predicted Total Shareholder Return, also consistent with AATQ's positive bias. More recent papers often examine complex questions, making bias' impact harder to predict. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grewal et al. (2010)</ref> consider satisfaction's distribution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dotzel et al. (2013)</ref> e innovativeness versus p innovativeness, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Malshe and Agarwal (2015)</ref> leverage's impact. The latter scholars' use of an AATQ adds noise connected to their hypothesis given that if highly leveraged firms spend less on marketing (creating intangibles), they can be expected to have lower AATQ at the same level of performance.   Morgan and Rego (2009) JM AATQ (and CF) ". . . marketing spending appears to be an investment rather than an expense" (p. 70).</p><p>Using an AATQ is problematic given bias in the measure.

Replicating part of their analysis with Alpha helps allay some bias concerns.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">LariviÃ¨re et al.

Five alternative time periods show a direct effect on the AATQ in three periods, and a direct and indirect effect in the other two. Noting problems with their AATQ, they retest with Carhart's four-factor model and show a much weaker relationship: no direct or indirect relationship in the main model, and only a single indirect, never direct, relationship, in one of five alternative models. Their results are consistent with the bias we outline. We would reiterate a vital point that they make: "our findings indicate that the relationship between satisfaction and [Shareholder Value] is sensitive to the metric used to assess performance" (p. 107). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Grewal (2004)</ref> measured performance with only an AATQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Luo and Donthu (2006)</ref> used stock return and an AATQ. The AATQ strongly supports their hypothesis, but the stock return model finds less significant support. They showed the robustness of the AATQ results using a simpler model (p. 85), unfortunately not retesting the stock return model. They suggested that "[t]hese less significant results in the stock return model (compared to Tobin's q) are not totally unexpected; a recent study by <ref type="bibr">Mittal and colleagues (2005)</ref> also finds that their marketing variables strongly influence Tobin's q but do not affect stock return significantly" (p. 84). We note that this is a pattern consistent with bias in the AATQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sridhar et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advertising and Communications</head><p>Note that our research suggests that AATQs' bias is more acute for marketing-focused firms and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McAlister et al.

(2009)</ref> show similar results using an AATQ and Stock Return, that is, do not show evidence of AATQ bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Morgan and Rego (2009)</ref> show mixed results for marketing's impact on an AATQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Groening et al.

Finally, we would advise against using an AATQ to test CSR's (Corporate Social Responsibility) impact as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kang et al. (2016)</ref> do. There is a bias toward showing success as CSR strategies often create unrecorded intangible assets, for example, "stakeholder relationships" (p. 62).</p><p>In general, the empirical findings are consistent with our analytical assessment of bias in AATQ: AATQ give more positive results for marketing related questions than other metrics. Of course, we do not formally demonstrate that any papers using AATQ have reached incorrect conclusions. Many involve complex interactions, advanced models, and dynamic outcomes making bias' impact hard to predict. Indeed, as research questions become more complex, it will only become harder to be confident that any bias is corrected by econometric choices. Given the problems with the metrics, we recommend that, going forward, marketers avoid using AATQ as performance metrics. Furthermore, we support the suggestion that scholars should use multiple measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Katsikeas et al. 2016)</ref> to allow for any bias to be more easier seen. Finally, we would also like to see detailed theoretical explanations for scholars' choice of dependent variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al. (2004)</ref> note that Tobin's q is "wellgrounded in economic theory" (p. 172). Unfortunately, the AATQ used in marketing research are different from Tobin's original q, and have no such theoretical grounding. AATQ seem to be on the rise in marketing research, which is worrying, given the false positives that AATQ can yield.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>AATQ's use in finance research and the implications for marketing. While scholars in other disciplines have disputed the value of Tobin's q <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Klock and Megna 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, McFarland 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Shepherd 1986</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Mittal et al. (2005, p. 550</ref>) simply assert its widespread acceptance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sridhar et al. (2016)</ref> do give two supportive citations from finance for Tobin's q's value, but draw one from a moderately ranked journal <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Parcharidis and Varsakelis 2010)</ref>, and another uses (a slightly different version of) Tobin's q merely as "further evidence" (Giroud and Mueller 2011) in a battery of measures. While the links to justifications of Tobin's q in finance are limited, we would say this is of modest importance. A metric's suitability depends on the question being addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ambler and Roberts 2008)</ref> so referring to use in another discipline may mean little. The way marketing investments are treated by financial accounting make AATQ especially problematic for marketing-related questions. For research in finance, the bias that we show may be mere noise if it does not relate directly to the hypothesis. Acceptability in finance would not mean AATQ are useful in marketing; metric choice must be justified for the question at hand.</p><p>Accounting and Marketing. The undervaluing of market-based assets is not a mistake by a few erroneous accountants, but a design feature of financial accounting. Given this, we support calls for more work at the interface of marketing and accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bendle and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang 2017, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Nissim 2011)</ref>. If marketers develop a greater understanding of accounting, this should help in creating and using better performance metrics and avoiding the sort of pitfalls we outline in this paper. It may also allow marketers to positively influence the choices of financial accountants, such as through the work of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB).</p><p>Is Tobin's q a good way to build credibility with managers Managers do not seem to see the value of AATQ <ref type="bibr">(Bendle et al. 2015, Mintz and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Currim 2013)</ref>. Marketing accountability research aims to examine marketing's value; yet much of the research focuses on how marketing impacts AATQ, metrics that managers do not consider important. Attempts to build marketing's credibility cannot be based on metrics that managers do not use and are biased toward finding marketing's effectiveness. Researchers should use metrics that are meaningful to nonresearchers or, at a minimum, argue in detail why the metrics should be meaningful to nonresearchers.</p><p>In conclusion, we hope marketing scholars reconsider using AATQ as performance metrics given that AATQ are biased toward false positives when firms make marketing investments. Some industries will have higher AATQ merely because they employ more unrecorded assets. "not much" is not empirically or theoretically addressed. There is the same error in the Chakravarthy citation as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Grewal (2004)</ref>. A connected question is whether the proportion of assets of a specific class that are recorded is set by accounting conventions. Accounting conventions allow for most tangible assets, even those internally generated, to be recorded but generally do not allow for internally generated intangibles to be recorded. Accounting conventions, therefore, impact asset recording, which directly impacts AATQ. Many scholars erroneously make claims contrary to this.

"Mk is the replacement cost of the firm's assets (e.g., plant, equipment) and is equal to the value of the firm that is attributable to its tangible assets" (p. 175).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Use Only Tangible Assets?</head><p>Marketing scholars sometimes claim that AATQ only use tangible assets. This is incorrect as intangible assets are reported in total assets and it is total, not just tangible, assets that are used in the AATQ employed by marketers in all the papers that we reviewed. (Financial accounting does exclude many intangibles but it does not exclude all.) In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">A</ref>.2, we italicize the key problematic claims.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Will Accounting-Based Approximations of Tobin's q Tend to 1?</head><p>The theory behind Tobin's q when the idea was initially proposed suggested that efficient markets might tend to approach a Tobin's q of 1. This idea persists in the marketing literature. The theory, however, does not relate to the AATQ used in marketing. Barring accounting errors, the proportion of assets recorded is less than 1. This means AATQ will usually be above 1 even in an equilibrium where market value equals the replacement cost of assets. It would be helpful going forward to note that the properties of the AATQ metrics used in marketing differ from the properties of Tobin's original theoretical q.
