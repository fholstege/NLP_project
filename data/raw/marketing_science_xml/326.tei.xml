<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and Motivation</head><p>Considerable effort in marketing is devoted to studying the dynamics by which consumers learn from their consumption experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Roberts and Urban 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Erdem and Keane 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Ching et al. 2013a</ref>. As an example, imagine new parents who have to shop for diapers, perhaps with little preexisting knowledge about this category. As these parents find out more about diaper brands through usage experience, they face a strategic choice. They can exploit their knowledge to date and select the most appealing brand. They can also explore further, which may entail sampling a currently less-than-ideal brand, so that they can make a more informed decision in the future.</p><p>Researchers have developed theory-rich models of optimizing forward-looking consumers who balance exploitation with exploration. Pillars of these models include an explicitly specified description of consumer utility and an explicitly specified process by which consumers learn. Most models assume consumers choose brands by solving a dynamic program that maximizes expected total utility taking learning into account. Researchers argue that theory-based models are more likely to uncover insight and be invariant for new-domain policy simulations <ref type="bibr">(Chintagunta et al. 2006, p. 604</ref>). However, these advantages often come at the expense of difficult problems and time-consuming solution methods.</p><p>The dynamic programs for forward-looking experiential learning models are, themselves, extremely difficult to solve optimally. We cite evidence below that the problems are PSPACE-hard-they are at least as hard to solve as any problem that requires PSPACE computational memory. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> This intractability presents both practical and theoretical challenges. Practically, researchers have had to rely on approximate solutions. Without explicit comparisons to the optimal solution, we do not know the impact of the approximations on estimation results. Moreover, the well-known "curse of dimensionality" prevents researchers from investigating problems with moderate or large numbers of brands or marketing variables, whereby even approximate solutions may not be feasible. Theoretically, it is reasonable to posit that a consumer cannot solve optimally in his or her head a dynamic problem that requires vast amounts of memory and computation. In fact, <ref type="bibr">Lin, Zhang, and Hauser:</ref> Learning from Experience, Simply 2 Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 1-19, © 2015 INFORMS well-developed theories in marketing, psychology, and economics suggest that observed consumer decision rules are often cognitively simple (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Payne et al. 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Payne et al. , 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996)</ref>.</p><p>We propose that consumers use cognitively simple heuristics to solve learning problems. As an example of the class of cognitively simple heuristics, we investigate an attractive candidate heuristic, index strategies, whereby a consumer develops a numerical score, or an index, for each brand separately and then chooses the brand with the largest index. Index strategies are a solution concept that decomposes an intractable problem into a set of tractable subproblems. We retain basic pillars of structural modeling such as an explicit description of consumer utility and the decision process and an assumption that consumers seek to optimize. We posit, in addition, a cost to solving complex problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shugan 1980, Johnson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Payne 1985)</ref>. We assume the consumer chooses a strategy that optimizes expected discounted utility minus this cognitive cost. Whereas the cost of cognitive complexity might be observable in the laboratory, say through response latency, it is unobservable in vivo. Instead, we identify domains where index strategies are nearly optimal in the sense of maximizing expected discounted utility. If, in such domains, index strategies are substantially simpler for the consumer to implement, then it is likely that savings in cognitive costs exceed the slight deviation from optimality and, hence, provide the consumer with greater utility net of cognitive costs. In the special cases where index strategies provide optimal expected utility, we argue that index strategies are superior as a description of forward-looking learning. Following the same logic, we establish conditions where myopic learning strategies (i.e., exploiting posterior beliefs without exploration) suffice to model consumer behavior.</p><p>To motivate the viability of index strategies as a descriptive model of consumers we (1) establish whether well-defined index strategies exist, (2) explain why they are intuitive and hence might be used by consumers, (3) investigate when index strategies are (near) optimal solutions to the reduced problem of utility maximization, and whether they are computationally simpler than the approximately optimal solution, 2 and (4) test whether index strategies explain observed consumer behavior at least as well as alternative models.</p><p>We address (1) analytically by proving the "indexability" property of canonical forward-looking experiential learning models. (Indexability is hard to establish in general.) We address (2) by examining the form and properties of index strategies and arguing they are behaviorally intuitive relative to the approximately optimal solution assumed in most forward-looking learning models. We address (3) using synthetic data. We address (4) by estimating alternative models using IRI data on the purchase of diapers, a product category where we expect to see forward-looking experiential learning.</p><p>Our basic hypothesis is that consumers can use a cognitively simple index strategy to solve forward-looking experiential learning problems. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is a conceptual summary of our hypothesis. We demonstrate viability by showing that there exists a well-defined index that satisfies the four criteria. We do not argue that consumers actually use this well-defined index. Rather we argue that the well-defined index is a better "as if" description than the (approximately) optimal solution strategy. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We first describe a canonical learning problem. We next briefly review literatures that address learning dynamics, cognitive simplicity, and related optimization problems. We then examine index strategies from the perspectives of theory, synthetic data, and empirical estimation. We close with extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Canonical Forward-Looking Experiential Learning Problem</head><p>We consider the following canonical forward-looking experiential learning problem. A consumer sequentially chooses from a set A containing J brands. Let j index brands and t index purchase occasions. The consumer's utility, u jt , from choosing j at t has three components. The first component is quality, q jt , which can be defined to include enjoyment, fit with needs, weighted sum of brand features, etc. Quality is drawn independently from a distribution F j q jt j with parameters j . The F j distributions are independent across j. This independence assumption rules out learning about a brand by choosing another. The consumer, however, does not know the value of the parameters j and observes 3 quality draws to infer the value of j . A quality draw of a brand is only realized after the consumer has chosen that brand. The second component of utility is a set of observable shocks, x jt , such as advertising, price, promotion, and other control variables that are observable to the researcher and consumer. For simplicity, we assume that observable shocks affect utility directly, although the model is extendable to indirect effects through the quality component as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerberg (2003)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Narayanan et al. (2005)</ref>. The third component of utility is an unobservable shock, jt , which represents random fluctuations in realized utility that are observed by the consumer, but not by the researcher.</p><p>Consumer decision making depends on quality and the weighted sum of observable and unobservable shocks, x jt + jt , where is a vector of weight parameters. We refer to this weighted sum as utility shocks. We let utility shocks be drawn from a joint distribution, H j x jt jt , independently over purchase occasions with parameters, . <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The H j 's are independent across j. The consumer knows the distribution H j and the value of , observes the current utility shocks prior to making a purchase decision, but does not know future realizations of the shocks. Notice that, unlike the quality draws, the utility shocks of a brand are realized regardless of whether the consumer has chosen that brand. We make the conservative assumption that utility shocks are independent of q jt and thus do not help the consumer learn quality directly. However, utility shocks do shape learning indirectly by varying the consumer's utility from exploitation, which in turn affects the incentive for exploration.</p><p>In summary, we write the consumer's utility from choosing brand j at purchase occasion t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u jt = q jt + x jt + jt (1)</formula><p>For ease of exposition, in the main analysis, we assume that the consumer is risk neutral. We extend the model to incorporate risk aversion in §8.1. We model each consumer as if the consumer uses Bayes Theorem to update beliefs about the quality parameter j after each consumption experience (assumed to occur after choice but before the next choice). Let s jt be the information set that summarizes the consumer's beliefs about j at purchase occasion t. At t = 0, beliefs about j are summarized by a prior distribution, B j0 j s j0 , where s j0 is based on all relevant prior experience. After the tth consumption experience the consumer's posterior beliefs are summarized by B jt j s jt . When both F j and prior beliefs are normal, Bayesian updating is naturally conjugate. We obtain s jt = ¯ jt ¯ jt using standard updating formulae. The parameters of posterior beliefs, s jt ∈ and the realized utility shocks, x jt ∈ X and jt ∈ E, summarize the state of information about brand j. The collection of brand-specific states, s t x t t = s 1t s 2t s Jt x 1t x 2t</p><p>x Jt 1t 2t Jt represents the set of states relevant to the decision problem at t.</p><p>We seek to model a decision strategy, × X × E J → A, that maps the state space to the choice set. Without further assumptions, the consumer must choose a decision strategy to maximize expected discounted utility:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V s t x t t = max Ɛ =t −t q j + x j + j s t x t t (2)</formula><p>where is the discount factor. The expectation Ɛ is taken over the stochastic process generated by the decision strategy (in particular, the transition between states that may depend on the consumer's brand choice). The infinite horizon can be justified either by consumption over a long horizon or by the consumer's subjective belief that the decision problem will end randomly.</p><p>The optimal solution to the consumer's decision problem can be characterized as the solution to the Bellman equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V s t x t t = max j∈A x jt + jt + Ɛ q jt + V s t+1 x t+1 t+1 s t j (3)</formula><p>Although the Bellman equation is conceptually simple, the full solution is computationally difficult because, even after integrating out the utility shocks x t and t , it evolves on a state space of size J , where is the number of elements in . Not only is J exponential in the number of brands J , it becomes extremely large if contains many elements, even when the optimal solution is approximated by choosing discrete points to represent , as is common in the literature. We provide an illustrative example in §4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Related Literatures</head><p>Before we introduce index strategies, it is helpful to review concepts from literatures on learning dynamics, cognitive simplicity, and related optimization problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Learning Dynamics</head><p>Many influential papers study consumer learning dynamics and apply learning models to explain or forecast consumer choices in problems related to the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Roberts and Urban (1988)</ref> estimate a model in which consumers use Bayesian learning to integrate information from a variety of sources to resolve uncertainty about brand quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref> build on the concept of Bayesian learning and include forward-looking consumers who trade off exploitation with exploration. For frequently purchased goods, their model fits data better than a no-learning model (reduced form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Guadagni and Little 1983)</ref> and the myopic learning model of Roberts and Urban.</p><p>These papers stimulated a line of research that estimates the dynamics of consumer learning-for a comprehensive review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ching et al. (2013a)</ref>. Some models focus on myopic consumers with Bayesian learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Narayanan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mehta et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chintagunta et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Narayanan and Manchanda 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ching and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ishihara 2010, 2012)</ref>, whereas others explicitly model forward-looking consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerberg 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Crawford and Shum 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Erdem et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Erdem et al. , 2008</ref>. The computational complexity of forwardlooking learning has been one of the reasons that some applications assume myopic learning. However, if a theory is accurately descriptive, more-complex forwardlooking models should improve policy simulations.</p><p>Because forward-looking choice problems that involve continuous state space generally cannot be solved optimally, significant effort has been spent on developing approximate solutions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Keane and Wolpin (1994)</ref> use Monte Carlo integration and interpolation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rust (1997a)</ref> introduces a randomization approach, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Imai et al. (2009)</ref> develop an estimator that combines dynamic programming solutions with a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Although these solution methods vary in speed, all attempt to approximate the Bellman equation to the overall problems and thus may suffer from the curse of dimensionality ( J .</p><p>At the same time of technical developments, there is a growing recognition of the need for richer theories of consumer behavior. For example, <ref type="bibr">Chintagunta et al. (2006, p. 614</ref>) suggest that "the future development of structural models in marketing will focus on the interface between economics and psychology."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Cognitive Simplicity</head><p>Parallel literatures in marketing, psychology, and economics provide evidence that consumers use decision rules that are cognitively simple. In marketing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Payne et al. (1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Payne et al. ( , 1993</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bettman et al. (1998)</ref> present evidence that consumers use simple heuristic decision rules to evaluate products. For example, under time pressure, consumers often use conjunctive rules (require a few "must have" features) rather than morecomplicated compensatory rules. Using simulated thinking costs with "elementary information processes," <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Johnson and Payne (1985)</ref> illustrate how heuristic decision rules can be rational when balancing utility and thinking costs. Methods to estimate the parameters of cognitively simple decision rules vary, but such rules often predict difficult consumer decisions as well as or better than compensatory rules (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bröder 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Gilbride and Allenby 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Kohli and Jedidi 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Yee et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Hauser et al. 2010</ref>.</p><p>Building on <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Simon's (1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Simon's ( , 1956</ref>) theory of bounded rationality, researchers in psychology argue that human beings use cognitively simple rules that are "fast and frugal" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Goldstein 1996, Martignon and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hoffrage 2002)</ref>. Fast and frugal rules evolve when consumers learn decision rules from experience. Consumers continue to use the decision rules because they lead to good outcomes in familiar environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Goldstein and Gigerenzer 2002)</ref>. For example, when judging the size of cities, "take the best" often leads to sound judgments. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In 2010-2011, two issues of Judgment and Decision Making were devoted to the recognition heuristic alone (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Marewski et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The costly nature of cognition has also received attention in economics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Camerer 2003</ref> for a review). A line of research looks to extend or revise standard dynamic decision making models with the explicit recognition that cognition is costly. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gabaix and Laibson (2000)</ref> empirically test a behavioral solution to decision-tree problems, whereby decision makers actively eliminate low-probability branches to simplify the task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gabaix et al. (2006)</ref> develop a "directed cognition model," in which a decision maker acts as if there is only one more opportunity to search. In the laboratory, the directed cognition model explains subjects' behavior better than a standard search model with costless cognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Houser et al. (2004)</ref> provide further evidence that consumers might use heuristic rules to solve dynamic programs.</p><p>Cognitive process mechanisms are debated in the marketing, psychology, and economics literatures. Our hypothesis, that consumers use heuristics such as index strategies, need only the observation that consumers favor decision rules that are cognitively simple and that such rules often lead to good outcomes. The simplicity hypothesis assumes that consumers trade off utility gains versus cognitive costs, but does not require explicit measurement of cognitive costs.</p></div>

But the principle is more general: simple solutions often perform well in complex optimization problems.</p><p>There are many examples in marketing and economics where descriptive decision rules solve more-complex problems. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> In domains such as consumer budget allocation, the choice of which information source to search, and the evaluation of products via agendas, heuristic solutions appear to describe consumer behavior well <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hauser 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Hauser and Urban 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Hauser et al. 1993</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rust (1997b)</ref> argues that it is likely consumers solve problems requiring an "infeasibly large number of calculations" by using heuristic solutions such as decomposition into subproblems. He states that "[t]he challenge is to recognize whether or not a problem is nearly decomposable, and if so, to identify its approximately independent subproblems, <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> determine whether they can be solved separately <ref type="bibr">(p. 18)</ref>." This view is closely related to our index approach to complex forward-looking learning problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Related Optimization Problems: Bandit</head><p>Problems and Index Solutions The model we formulate in §2 is closely related to the multi-armed bandit problem, a prototypical problem that illustrates the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation in sequential decision making under uncertainty. In a bandit problem, the decision maker faces a finite number of choices, each of which yields an uncertain payoff. The decision maker must make choices, observe outcomes, and update beliefs with a sequential decision rule. The decision maker seeks to maximize expected discounted values.</p><p>The bandit problem was first formulated by the British in World War II, and, for over 30 years, no simple solution was known. Then <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gittins and Jones (1974)</ref> demonstrated a simple index solution-develop an index for each "arm" (i.e., each choice alternative) by solving a subproblem that involves only that arm, then choose the arm with the largest index. This index solution reduces an exponentially complex problem to a set of one-dimensional problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gittins and Jones (1974)</ref> proved the surprising result that the index solution is the optimal solution to the classic bandit problem. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> However, the Gittins-Jones' striking result comes at the cost of a strict assumption that the states of the nonchosen choice alternatives do not evolve. When this assumption is violated, say because of random shocks, Gittins' index is no longer guaranteed to be optimal. Such problems are known as restless bandits <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Whittle 1988</ref>) and, in general, are computationally intractable (Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis 1999). In his seminal paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Whittle (1988)</ref> proposes a tractable heuristic solution. The solution generalizes Gittins' index such that the problems can be solved optimally or near optimally by associating an index, referred to as Whittle's index, separately with each alternative and choosing the alternative with the largest index.</p><p>The existence of well-defined index solutions relies on a structural property called indexability, which is not guaranteed for all restless bandit problems. <ref type="bibr">Whittle (1988, p. 292)</ref> wrote that "One would very much like to have simple sufficient conditions for indexability; at the moment, none are known" (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Niño-Mora 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Gittins et al. (2011, p. 154</ref>) also lament that "the question of indexability is subtle, and a complete understanding is yet to be achieved." <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In an important class of marketing models, choice models, consumer utility tends to be restless over purchase occasions. For example, in most random-utility choice models there is an idiosyncratic "error term" as well as other changes in the choice environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">McFadden 1986)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Without further study, we do not know whether <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Hauser et al. ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) apply Gittins' index to derive optimal "website morphing" strategies that match website design with customers' cognitive styles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Urban et al. (2014)</ref> field test morphing for AT&amp;T's banner advertising on CNET and General Motors' banner advertising on a variety of websites.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">An Index Strategy in the Absence of Utility Shocks</head><p>The learning problem we examine includes utility shocks, but it is easier to illustrate the intuition of index strategies using a problem without utility shocks.</p><p>Temporarily assume both observable and unobservable shocks are zero for all j and t, although the same result holds when there is no intertemporal variation in x jt and jt . In this special case, the consumer's decision problem is a classic multi-armed bandit. Gittins' insight is as follows. To evaluate a brand j, the consumer thinks as if he or she is choosing between this brand and a reward j that is fixed for all future purchase occasions. The consumer thus solves a subproblem at each purchase occasion-the consumer can either sample this brand to gain more information about it, or exploit the fixed reward j . In the latter case, the consumer's belief about brand j ceases to evolve, such that s j t+1 = s jt . The optimal solution to this subproblem is determined by a greatly simplified version of the Bellman equation:</p><p>V s jt j = max j + V s jt j Ɛ q jt + V s j t+1 j s jt (4)  Notice that each subproblem only depends on the state evolution of a single brand, j. The subproblem is much simpler than the full problem specified in Equation (3).</p><p>Gittins' index, G s jt , is defined as the smallest value of j such that the consumer at purchase occasion t is just indifferent between experiencing brand j and receiving the fixed reward. That is, we obtain G s jt by equating the two terms inside the maximization operator of Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). Gittins proposes that G s jt could be used as a measuring device for the value of exploring brand j-if there is more uncertainty about a brand left to explore, the consumer will demand a higher fixed reward to be willing to stop exploration. Naturally, Gittins' index is updated when new information arrives.</p><p>Gittins' surprising result is the Index Theorem. The optimal solution is to choose the brand with the highest index at each purchase occasion. A computationally difficult problem has thus been decomposed into J simpler subproblems.</p><p>Index Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gittins and Jones 1974)</ref>. The optimal decision strategy when there are no utility shocks is G s t = arg max j∈A G s jt . Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates intuitive properties of Gittins' index. We consider one brand. The solid line plots one realization of Gittins' index as it evolves when the brand is chosen repeatedly. The dashed line plots the consumer's posterior mean quality belief. It is updated by brand experience and converges toward the true brand quality. Myopic consumers would exploit experience and choose the brand that yields the highest posterior mean quality. Forward-looking consumers may want to explore further. The dotted curve, which is simply the difference between Gittins' index and the posterior mean quality, measures the value of exploration. This curve declines smoothly with experience because the value of exploration decreases as the consumer learns more about brand quality. When we plot Gittins' index as a function of the consumer's posterior quality uncertainty¯ jt (not shown), it is also intuitive-the index increases with¯ jt because the value of exploration increases with the remaining amount of quality uncertainty. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and the simple relationship between Gittins' index and posterior quality beliefs suggest that a consumer might intuit something close to the dotted curve if there were no utility shocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">An Index Strategy in the Presence of Utility Shocks</head><p>We now allow utility shocks. Observable shocks x jt include effects that researchers observe and model, such as changes in advertising, price, or promotion. Unobservable shocks jt include effects that researchers do not observe and that do not provide a signal about quality. The presence of unobservable shocks is central to many empirical consumer choice models. Because shocks enter the utility function regardless of the consumer's decisions, the consumer may, in any purchase occasion, switch among brands. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> When the model includes utility shocks, the Gittins-Jones index theorem no longer applies because the states of nonchosen brands do not remain constant. With shocks, the consumer's problem belongs to the class of restless-bandit problems as introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Whittle (1988)</ref>. In general, such optimization problems are PSPACE-hard (Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis 1999, Theorem 4) making the problem extremely difficult, if not infeasible, to solve and making it implausible that the consumer would use a solution strategy based on Equation (3). Among other difficulties, PSPACE-hard problems require extremely large memory-a particularly scarce resource for consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Lindsay and Norman 1977, p. 306;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bettman 1979, p. 140)</ref>. We develop a theoretical solution to this problem in this section.

At each purchase occasion, to evaluate a brand j, the consumer thinks as if he or she must choose between brand j and a reward j that is fixed for all future purchase occasions. The Bellman equation for the jth subproblem, which now includes utility shocks, becomes V s jt x jt jt j = max j + Ɛ V s jt x j t+1 j t+1 j</p><p>x jt + jt + Ɛ q jt + V s j t+1 x j t+1 j t+1 j s jt (5)</p><p>The index is defined as the smallest value of j such that the consumer at purchase occasion t is just indifferent between choosing brand j and receiving the fixed reward.

A brand j is indexable if, for any t, S t j ⊆ S t j for any j &lt; j . Indexability requires that, as the fixed reward increases, the collection of states for which the fixed reward is optimal does not decrease. In other words, if in some state it is optimal to choose the fixed reward, it must also be optimal to choose a higher fixed reward. Indexability implies a consistent ordering of brands for any state, so an index strategy is meaningful. However, indexability need not always hold in general and cannot be taken for granted <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Whittle 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Thus, before we can posit an index strategy as a consumer heuristic, we must establish indexability for a model that includes utility shocks. In Online Appendix A (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ mksc.2014.0868), we prove the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 1 (Indexability). The canonical forwardlooking experiential learning problem defined in §2 is indexable.</p><p>Once the indexability condition is established, then a well-defined strategy is to choose at each purchase occasion the brand with the largest index. The index strategy breaks the curse of dimensionality by decomposing a problem with exponential complexity into J much simpler subproblems, each on a state space of after integrating out the utility shocks x jt and jt . With this simplification, it is more plausible that the consumer might use the index strategy. As a bonus, Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 1-19, © 2015 INFORMS estimation is much faster. The difference in the size of the state space can be dramatic. For example, suppose we were interested in the mean and variance of quality and discretized them with M and N grid points, respectively. With J brands, the state space for index strategies is M × N for each brand, rather than M × N J for the original optimization problem given in Equation (3). For M = N = 10 and J = 6, this is the difference between a state space of 100 (for each of the six brands) and 1,000,000,000,000.</p></div>

We expect future laboratory experiments to address this issue empirically. In this paper, we argue that index strategies have intuitive properties and that it is not unreasonable for the consumer to intuit those properties.</p><p>An index strategy would be difficult for the consumer to use if the strategy were not invariant to permissible scale transformations. If it is invariant the consumer can intuit (or learn) the basic shape of the index function and use that intuited shape in many situations. Invariance facilitates ecological rationality. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> The following results hold for fairly general distributions of quality, F j q jt j , and joint distributions of utility shocks x jt and jt , as long as they have scale and location parameters and the quality belief B jt j s jt is conjugate.

In Online Appendix B we prove the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 2 (Invariance). LetW be Whittle's index for the canonical forward-looking experiential learning problem computed when the posterior mean quality (¯ jt ) is zero, the mean utility shock ( x j ) is zero, and the inherent variation of quality ( j ) is one.

To assess the value of exploration, the consumer need only intuit the shape ofW for a limited range of parameter values and scale it by j . Proposition 2 also helps researchers understand which parameters can be identified in the index-strategy model.</p><p>To provide further intuition, we prove the following proposition in Online Appendix C. The proposition shows that Whittle's index behaves as expected when the parameters of the problem vary. The consumer likes increases in quality and utility shocks, dislikes inherent uncertainty in quality and utility shocks, but values the ability to learn and, hence, resolve the uncertainty in posterior beliefs about quality.</p><p>Proposition 3 (Comparative Statics). Whittle's index for the canonical forward-looking experiential learning problem (1) increases with the posterior mean of quality (¯ jt ), the observable utility shocks ( x jt ), and the unobservable utility shock ( jt ); (2) weakly decreases with the inherent uncertainty in quality ( j ) and the magnitude of uncertainty in the utility shocks ( x j ); and (3) weakly increases with the consumer's posterior uncertainty about quality (¯ jt ). . As the magnitude of utility shocks becomes larger, it is less important for the consumer to explore, and the value of exploration decreases as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. These properties and the shape of the curve itself, are intuitive.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Proposition 3 suggest that, other things being equal, when the magnitude of the uncertainty in utility shocks is larger, the realized utility shocks are more likely to be the deciding factor in consumers' brand choices. For example, as the depth of price promotions increases, consumers are more likely to base their purchase decisions on price. When  shocks, the value to the consumer from looking forward increases.</p><p>(2) As the magnitude of the utility shocks increases relative to the consumer's posterior uncertainty in quality, the value from looking forward decreases. In this latter case, a myopic leaning strategy (i.e., exploiting posterior beliefs) may suffice, and could be the optimal strategy if it is cognitively simpler than a forward-looking learning strategy.</p><p>These results highlight the intricate relationship between the consumer's uncertainty in quality and uncertainty caused by utility shocks. The two types of uncertainty complement each other in driving the consumer's value of exploitation, but may compete with each other in shaping the consumer's value of exploration. The index solution offers an intuitive description of this relationship. In § §6 and 7, we examine the empirical performance of the index strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Examination of the Near Optimality of an Index Strategy (Synthetic Data)</head><p>We now examine whether an index strategy implies a reasonable trade-off between optimality and simplicity. Indexability guarantees existence of a well-defined index strategy but does not guarantee its optimality. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> For the canonical forward-looking experiential learning problem, the performance of the index strategy is an empirical question. Cognitive costs remain unobservable, but § §4 and 5 suggest that an index strategy could be substantially simpler than the direct solution of the Bellman equation to the overall problem. To examine whether the loss in utility is small, we switch from analytic derivations to synthetic data because the loss in utility is an issue of magnitude rather than direction. Synthetic data establish existence (rather than universality) of situations where index strategies are close to optimal. For concreteness we examine the special case when F j and B jt are normal distributions. From the perspective of consumer decision making, what matters is the joint distribution of observable shocks ( x jt and unobservable shocks ( jt . Therefore, for the synthetic-data analysis we set observable shocks to zero without loss of generality. Practically, even if there are no observable shocks (e.g., no price promotions), unobservable shocks (e.g., idiosyncratic taste fluctuations) are still likely to prevail in most choice models. We allow for both observable and unobservable shocks in the field-data analysis.</p><p>We compare four decision strategies that the consumer might use.</p><p>1. No learning. The consumer chooses the brand based only on the consumer's prior beliefs of quality and the current utility shocks. This strategy provides a baseline to evaluate the incremental value of learning.</p><p>2. Myopic learning. The consumer chooses the brand based only on the consumer's posterior quality beliefs and the current utility shocks. This strategy exploits the consumer's posterior knowledge about brand quality. The corollary predicts that this strategy will suffice when the magnitude of utility shocks is relatively high compared with posterior quality uncertainty.</p><p>3. Index strategy. This strategy assumes the consumer can intuit the shape of Whittle's index. As per Proposition 2, this strategy improves on the myopic learning strategy to take into account the exploration value of learning. Brand choices reflect the consumer's trade-off between exploitation and exploration.</p><p>4. Approximately optimal. The PSPACE-hard forwardlooking experiential learning problem cannot be solved Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 1-19, © 2015 INFORMS optimally, hence researchers resort to approximate solutions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Keane and Wolpin 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Erdem and Keane 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Rust 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ackerberg 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Crawford and Shum 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Imai et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Ching 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Ching et al. 2013b</ref>.

The simulation requires a finite horizon; we select T = 50 purchase occasions. If the discount factor is = 0 90, truncation to such a finite horizon is negligible. We discretize the state space, s jt = ¯ jt ¯ jt into a set of M × N grid points for each of J brands. We choose M × N = 200 × 50 = 10 4 , which should be close to optimal in the continuous problem. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> To simplify integration we draw the utility shocks from a Gumbel distribution with parameters j j and normalize the location parameter such that the utility shocks have zero unconditional means <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rust 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rust , 1994</ref>.

Because quality beliefs are relative, we fix the prior mean quality belief of brand 1 as¯ 10 = 0 and vary the prior mean quality belief for brand 2 as¯ 20 ∈ −0 3 0 0 3 . We normalize the standard deviation of brand 2's prior quality belief as 20 = 1 and the standard deviation of brand 1's prior quality belief as¯ 10 = 0 5. Finally, to test the corollary we allow the uncertainty in shocks to vary from relatively small to relatively large: 1 = 2 ∈ 0 1 1 .</p><p>We compute the indices and the consumer's expected total utilities for 50 purchase occasions under the four decision strategies. Details are provided in Online Appendices D and E. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes the results.</p><p>We first examine computation time as a surrogate for cognitive complexity. As expected, the no-learning and myopic learning strategies impose negligible computation time, the index strategy requires moderate <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We choose M = 200 grid points for the posterior mean quality. Meanwhile, we fix each brand's prior quality variance. Posterior quality variance evolves deterministically following Bayesian updating formulae. Because there are T = 50 purchase occasions, a brand's posterior quality variance has N = T = 50 possible values, depending on how many times this brand has been chosen. Therefore, the size of the state space for the index strategy is M × N = 200 × 50 = 10 4 . computation time, and the approximately optimal solution is substantially slower-600 times as time consuming as the index strategy even for this basic problem. Faster approximation algorithms would reduce the computational time for the approximately optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Keane and Wolpin 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Rust 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Imai et al. 2009</ref>), but they would also expedite the index strategy because we use the same algorithm for solving the Bellman equations in both models (see Online Appendix G for implementation details). Moreover, faster approximation algorithms do not address the curse of dimensionality. The ratio of computational time in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> could be made arbitrarily large with finer grid points or with a larger number of brands.</p><p>We next examine the consumer's expected utilities. In all cases, the no-learning strategy leads to the lowest utility, which suggests that learning is valuable. Furthermore, the index strategy is statistically indistinguishable from the approximately optimal strategy. As long as cognitive simplicity matters even a little, the index strategy will be better on utility minus complexity.</p><p>Finally, the results are consistent with the corollary. When there is relatively low uncertainty in utility shocks (upper panel of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), the index strategy and the approximately optimal strategy generate higher utility than myopic learning, and, in two of the three cases, significantly higher utility. When there is relatively high uncertainty in utility shocks (lower panel of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), the myopic learning model performs virtually the same as either the index strategy or the approximately optimal strategy. The differences are not significant. In this case, the consumer might achieve the best utility minus complexity with a myopic strategy, among the models tested.</p><p>Analysis of synthetic data never covers all cases. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> is best interpreted as providing evidence that (1) there exist reasonable situations where an index solution is better than the approximately optimal solution on utility minus complexity and (2) there exist domains where myopic learning is best on utility minus complexity. We now examine field data.</p></div>

Parents typically begin purchasing diapers based on a discrete birth event, and their entry to the category is arguably exogenous . Even if the birth is a second or subsequent child, diaper quality may have changed. Informal qualitative interviews suggest that parents learn about whether diaper brands match their needs through experience (with often more than one purchase), that diapers are sufficiently important that parents take learning seriously, and that parents often try multiple brands before settling on a favorite brand.

Finally, diapers have the advantage of being regular purchases, where the no-choice option is less of a concern, and consumers tend to be in the market for many purchase occasions.</p><p>To isolate a situation favoring forward-looking learning, we apply the following sample screening criteria. First, to focus on consumers whose purchases are likely triggered by a birth event, we select households whose first purchase occurs 30 weeks after the start of data collection (73% of the entire sample). Second, we focus on frequent buyers. Compared with occasional buyers who might be shopping for a baby shower, frequent buyers are more likely to have both the motivation and the opportunity to explore different diaper brands. Therefore, we select households who have made at least five purchases during the observation window (39% of the entire sample). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Third, to focus further, we eliminate any consumers who have purchased private labels and restrict attention to consumers who buy exclusively branded products (64% of the entire sample).

The standard deviation of x jt is observed in the data. We can then compute x j from j because the observable and unobservable shocks are independent. As in most dynamic discrete choice processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rust 1994)</ref>, the discount factor is difficult to estimate; we set it to 0 90. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Finally, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref>, we suppress "parameter heterogeneity" among households. We continue to allow each household's quality beliefs to evolve idiosyncratically, but we do not attempt to estimate heterogeneity in prior beliefs, true mean quality, or the magnitude of utility shocks. We abstract away from parameter heterogeneity for the following reasons. First, there are, on average, only 13 purchases per household. We would overly strain the model by attempting to estimate heterogeneity in all of the parameters. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Second, we wish to focus on behavioral heterogeneity that arises endogenously from forward-looking learning. Even if households start with exogenously homogeneous prior beliefs, different quality realizations and utility shocks lead to different posterior beliefs, different exploitation-versus-exploration trade-offs, and different learning paths (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ching et al. 2013a</ref>). We seek to evaluate heterogeneous learning dynamics based on the data, rather than using heterogeneous parameters to fit the data. For an initial test of an index strategy, this simplification is conservative because it biases against a good model fit.</p><p>We estimate each model's parameters with maximum simulated likelihood estimation. Estimation details are provided in Online Appendices F and G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Estimation Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> summarizes the fit statistics for the 1,538 diaper purchases in the in-sample estimation and the 1,841 purchases in the out-of-sample validation. An information-theoretic measure, U 2 , calculates the percent of uncertainty explained by the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hauser 1978)</ref>; the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) attempt to correct the likelihood function based on the number of parameters in the in-sample estimation, BIC more so than AIC. (There are no free parameters in the out-of-sample validation.)</p><p>For comparability, we estimate the index strategy in two ways. The first estimation discretizes the state space in the same manner as the approximately optimal model M = N = 5 . This enables an "apples-to-apples" comparison. Then, because the index model does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we reestimate the model with a finer grid (M = 200 N = 75 . There are only trivial differences. For example, U 2 = 88 18% for both estimations, and parameter values are not significantly different (nor different from the approximately optimal model). We report the results associated with the finer grid for the rest of the paper.</p><p>First, on all measures there are sizable gains to learning-all learning models explain and predict brand choices substantially better than the no-learning strategy. Second, the index strategy improves in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictions relative to myopic learning. The likelihood is significantly better (Vuong test significance is p = 0 0002 in-sample and 0 0429 out-of-sample). <ref type="bibr">24</ref> This result is consistent with our expectation that frequent buyers of branded diapers are forward looking. Third, the index strategy performs as well as the approximately optimal solution in terms of both in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictions. This result is consistent with the synthetic-data analysis-when two strategies yield almost the same expected utilities and hence predict almost the same brand choices, they are observationally equivalent and statistically indistinguishable.</p><p>As a further visualization of model fit, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>(b) reports the predicted market-share-weighted switching patterns. The predicted switching patterns are qualitatively similar to actual switching patterns in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>(a). For example, the index strategy model picks up the fact that consumers are more loyal to Huggies than to the other brands because, as we discuss below, the true mean quality is higher for Huggies and it is likely more rewarding to learn about Huggies ( x j being relatively small). Although predictions are not perfect and could be improved if other x-variables were observed, the overall mean absolute error (MAE) is within 0 8% of actual switching. Moreover, the predicted switching patterns from the index strategy model are virtually identical to those from the approximately optimal solution model (reported in Online Appendix H). The market-share-weighted MAE is approximately 3/100ths of 1%.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> summarizes the estimated parameter values. As expected, the price sensitivity coefficient is negative in every model. Across all learning models, all four brands increase in mean quality relative to prior beliefs, which implies that diaper buyers learn to appreciate these brands more through experience. These results are consistent with the switching patterns in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2(</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a).</head><p>Forward-looking models identify the magnitude of utility shocks relative to inherent quality uncertainty (last panel of Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Because the relative shock uncertainty varies across brands, the index curve implies different behavior than myopic learning for those brands. This explains why forward-looking models fit and predict better than myopic learning. For example, Huggies has lower relative shock uncertainty than other brands, which may provide greater incentives for consumers to explore Huggies. Because the myopic learning model ignores this difference, it compensates by overestimating the mean prior belief of Huggies.  a This is the time required to compute one likelihood function using a university computing system based on Sun Grid Engine and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The approximately optimal model is estimated using the original grid (M = N = 5). For the index strategy model, the computation time is 1.4 seconds for the original grid and 22 seconds for the finer grid (M = 200, N = 75 .</p><p>Managerially, Huggies has a higher true mean quality than Pampers and Luvs, but also higher inherent relative uncertainty in quality across consumption. (The table reports the ratio of shock uncertainty to quality uncertainty-a smaller number means higher relative quality uncertainty.)</p><p>Both the index strategy and the approximately optimal strategy lead to similar parameter estimates. Parameter estimates of either model are usually within confidence regions of the alternative model. This result is consistent with the synthetic-data analysis, which suggests that both strategies lead to near optimal utility. The index strategy will be a more plausible description of consumer behavior if it is cognitively simpler. We explore this last point below.</p><p>Computation time in the embedded optimization problem is one surrogate for cognitive complexity. The last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> reports the time necessary to compute one likelihood function in each model. For the index strategy model we report the computation time for both the original grid (M = N = 5 and the finer grid (M = 200, N = 75 -the latter is in parentheses. Consistent with the synthetic-data analysis, the index strategy is substantially faster than the approximately optimal strategy (74-to-1 ratio based on the same grid density of M = N = 5 .</p><p>The size of the state space is another surrogate for cognitive complexity (e.g., a consumer's memory). The state space for the approximately optimal strategy is 15,625 times as large as the state space for the index strategy given the same grid density of M = N = 5. Computational-time ratios are not equal to state-space ratios because of computational overhead. Nonetheless, if we were to attempt to use the finer grid of M = 200, N = 75 for the approximately optimal strategy, we would increase the state space of the approximately optimal solution by a factor of 130 billion. It is unlikely that approximately optimal computations would be feasible for the finer grid. Detailed calculations are presented in Online Appendix G.</p><p>In summary, using IRI data on diaper purchases we find that (1) learning models fit and predict substantially better than the no-learning model; (2) forwardlooking learning models fit and predict significantly better than the myopic learning model; (3) the index strategy and the approximately optimal solution achieve similar in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasts, as well as reasonably close parameter estimates; and (4) computational (and cognitive) simplicity favors the index strategy model relative to the approximately optimal model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Risk Aversion</head><p>For ease of exposition, in previous sections we assumed that consumers are risk neutral. However, risk aversion can be an important issue for decision making under uncertainty (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ching et al. 2013a</ref> for a review). We generalize our model to incorporate risk aversion following the standard discounted-utility approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Samuelson 1937, Erdem and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Keane 1996)</ref>. At each purchase occasion t, the consumer maximizes =t −t u w , where w is the net payoff the consumer receives at purchase occasion , and u • is the consumer's utility function. Utility increases with net payoff (i.e., u &gt; 0 . In addition, the curvature of the utility function captures general risk preferences: the consumer is risk The indexability result allows us to test for risk aversion at low computational costs. We do so using the diaper data. To parameterize the test, we assume that consumers exhibit constant absolute risk aversion: u w = 1 − e −rw , where r &gt; 0 measures the degree of risk aversion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Roberts and Urban 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Based on this utility function, we reestimate the index strategy model. In addition, we reestimate the myopic learning model to see whether general risk preferences as opposed to the exploration incentive suffice to explain consumer choices. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> reports the fit statistics. Allowing for risk aversion brings little improvement to the likelihood and U 2 , and worsens the AIC and BIC because of the extra risk-aversion parameter. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> reports the parameter estimates. The risk-aversion parameter is insignificant for the myopic learning model; it is marginally significant for the index strategy model but the magnitude is small. Diaper buyers in our sample do not seem to be strongly risk averse. Because the approximately optimal model provides parameter estimates that are close to the index model for the risk neutral case, we expect similar results if we were to estimate the approximately optimal model for the risk averse case.</p></div>

However, from the good fit and predictive ability of the three tested heuristics (Whittle's index, one-period look-ahead, and modified Gittins' index), we are comfortable in our hypotheses that (1) cognitively simple heuristics are plausible alternatives to modeling forward-looking behavior and (2) an index strategy is one viable model.</p></div>

We assume there are two latent consumer segments that represent the two "extremes" of the foresight spectrum. One segment engages in myopic learning and the other segment has perfect foresight.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.">Private Labels</head><p>Our primary analyses eliminated any consumer who purchased a private label during the observation window.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Summary, Conclusions, and Future Research</head><p>Models of forward-looking experiential learning are important to marketing. These theory-driven models examine how consumers make trade-offs between exploiting and exploring brand information. Managerially, these models enable researchers to investigate effects due to quality uncertainty, learning, and the variation in utility shocks. However, the consumer problem in these models is computationally intractable (PSPACE-hard). Existing solutions via the Bellman equation require vast computational resources (time and memory) that may contradict cognitive simplicity theories of consumers.</p><p>In this paper we propose that consumers use cognitively simple heuristics to solve forward-looking experiential learning problems. We explore one viable heuristic-index strategies. Index strategies represent a solution concept that decomposes a complex problem into a set of much simpler subproblems. We prove analytically that an index strategy exists for canonical forward-looking experiential learning models and that the index function has simple properties that consumers might intuit. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that a well-defined index solution achieves near optimal expected utility and is fast to compute. Using IRI data on diaper purchases, we show that at least one index solution fits the data and predicts out-of-sample significantly better than either a no-learning model or a myopic learning model. Compared with an approximately optimal solution, the index strategy fits equally well, produces similar estimation results (and hence managerial implications), requires significantly lower computational costs and, we believe, is more likely to describe consumer behavior.</p><p>We address many issues, but many issues remain. We do not model advertising as a quality signal (the IRI data set for the diaper category does not track advertising). The consequence of incorporating advertising signals depends on how consumers learn. We abstract away from inventory problems. Inventory effects are found to be insignificant in previous research , but nevertheless add a dimension to consumers' dynamic planning. We study standard settings where consumers do not learn from nonchosen alternatives. It would be interesting to model correlated learning or extend index strategies to incorporate hypothetical reinforcement of nonchosen options <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Camerer and Ho 1999)</ref>. Technically, it would also be interesting Marketing Science 34(1), pp. <ref type="bibr">1-19, © 2015 INFORMS</ref> to examine the indexability of learning models when there are switching costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">29</ref> Diaper buyers are likely forward looking, but consumers in other product categories may not be. Our theory suggests that consumers are most likely to be forward looking when shock uncertainty is small compared with quality uncertainty; we expect myopic learning models to do well when shock uncertainty is large. This prediction is testable using cross-category analysis. For instance, shock uncertainty may be large in hedonic goods categories where consumption value swings with idiosyncratic mood. Shock uncertainty may also be dominant in markets characterized by volatile marketing mix variables. The recent rise of flash sales introduced remarkable price volatility to categories such as food, gadgets, and apparel. It will be interesting to study whether this change serves to promote myopic purchase behaviors.</p><p>Finally, an index solution appears to be a reasonable trade-off for diaper consumers, but our basic hypothesis is that consumers use cognitively simple heuristic strategies. Other cognitively simple heuristics might explain consumer behavior even better than index strategies. Section 8.2 suggests testable alternatives. Future research can explore these and other heuristics using either field data or laboratory experiments.</p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">PSPACE is the set of problems that use polynomial-sized memorymemory proportional to n , where is a measure of the size of the problem and n can be extremely large. PSPACE-hard problems are at least as hard as NP-hard problems, which are themselves suspected of being unsolvable in polynomial time.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">We use computational simplicity as a surrogate for cognitive simplicity in this paper.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">An empirical search among heuristics would risk exploiting random variation in the data. Instead we demonstrate that an index strategy, and at least one other cognitively simple heuristic, performs well on the data.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Observable shocks can be independently distributed over purchase occasions for a number of reasons. For example, firms may intentionally randomize price promotions in response to competition. Such "mixed strategies" can generate observed prices that appear to be independently drawn at each purchase occasion from a known distribution<ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Narasimhan 1988</ref>).</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">The take-the-best rule is, simply, if you recognize one city and not the other it is likely larger; if you recognize both use the most diagnostic feature to make the choice.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Professional athletes use more-complicated heuristics that give them greater range, for example, in baseball, prepositioning based on prior tendencies and the expected pitch, and the sound as the bat hits the ball.8  Of course, the empirical performance of descriptive solutions is not guaranteed.<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gilovich et al. (2002)</ref> provide a comprehensive survey of human decision heuristics and their possible biases.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">Even when there is no learning, a typical empirical model of consumer choices may include a shock, or an idiosyncratic error, jt , that is treated as unobservable by researchers. Without this shock, the model would predict that the consumer makes the same choice over purchase occasions if all other observable factors remain constant. In the context of learning, incorporating this shock allows for switching among brands even when the consumer has learned much about brand quality.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="22">Sensitivity analyses with other discount rates (e.g., 0.95 and 0.99) yield almost identical log-likelihood statistics and similar parameter estimates for the index strategy model. Anticipating the results of §7.4, we expect a similar lack of sensitivity for the approximately optimal strategy. The ease with which such sensitivity checks can be run is a benefit of the computational tractability of the index strategy model.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">Doing so is technically feasible, but would likely over-parameterize the model and exploit noise in the data. More importantly, our goal is to demonstrate that an index solution is a viable representation of cognitive simplicity and that cognitive simplicity is a phenomenon worth studying in structural models. We leave explicit modeling of parameter heterogeneity to future research. Section 8.3 explores foresight heterogeneity.</note>
