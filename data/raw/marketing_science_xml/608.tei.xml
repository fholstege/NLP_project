<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the last decade, the grocery-retailing landscape has changed dramatically in most Western economies. The emergence of the hard-discount format, popularized by companies such as Aldi and Lidl, has altered the dynamics of the industry significantly. Hard discounters are distinct from every-day-lowprice retailers such as Wal-Mart (studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Singh et al. 2006 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. 2009</ref>) in the United States, and from large supermarkets such as Albert Heijn and Tesco in Europe. First, they offer much fewer categories of goods, and stock only a limited selection of items-typically fewer than 1,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs), compared to the 15,000+ items carried in most supermarkets or the 80,000+ items in a Wal-Mart supercenter. Second, they offer very few, or even no, manufacturer brands. Their assortment is dominated by private labels whose quality is often as good as that of leading national brands. Third, their stores are relatively small, with a trading area often not exceeding 11,000 square feet <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(PlanetRetail 2006a)</ref>. The shopping environment is very functional (even minimalistic), and few services are offered to consumers. For example, discounters tend to have bare walls, and customers typically have to select their groceries from cardboard boxes stacked on pallets. Above all, prices are very low. They can be up to 60% lower than the price of leading name brands and as much as 40% lower than traditional retailers' private-label products.</p><p>Early on, conventional retailers dismissed hard discounters as an anomaly from Germany, where the <ref type="bibr">Cleeren et al.: Intra-and Interformat Competition Among Discounters and Supermarkets Marketing Science 29(3), pp. 456-473, Â© 2010 INFORMS 457</ref> format originated. However, its two most successful discount chains, Aldi and Lidl, which together operate over 13,000 stores and account for more than 50% of the discount sales in Europe, have brought their tactics (mimicked by many other chains) to other parts of Europe and far beyond. In countries such as Austria (18.9% discount share), Denmark (15.8%), and Belgium (10.9%), the discount share of the grocery market already exceeds 10%, and shares as high as 26.9% and 34.7% are obtained in Germany and Norway. At the moment, there are around 35,000 discount grocery stores in Europe, a number forecasted to increase nearly 30% to 45,000 in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(PlanetRetail 2006a)</ref>. Apart from Aldi and Lidl, well-known European discount chains include Plus and Penny in Germany, NORMA and Ed in France, Dia in Spain, Asda Essentials in the United Kingdom, and Dansk in Denmark. In the United States, comparable stores are price-aggressive grocery discounters, such as Save-A-Lot, who witness rapid growth as well. Several leading European players, among which are Aldi and Lidl, have recently announced plans to considerably expand their U.S. presence.</p><p>The success of discounters has become a major source of concern for traditional retailers. Discounters not only have a direct effect on traditional retailers' market share, but they also put pressure on other players to increase operational efficiency and/or decrease prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(van Heerde et al. 2008)</ref>. Conventional retailers can fight back on two fronts. First, they can become involved in the discount format themselves. Carrefour, Casino, and Rewe, for example, have already established discount chains of their own (i.e., ED, Leader Price, and Penny), whereas Auchan and Tesco are experimenting along the same lines. In so doing, these retailers hope to capitalize on the growth of the discount-prone segment and to curb the growth of competitors such as Aldi and Lidl, who only operate through the discount format. Still, this practice may well cannibalize their core business, i.e., their conventional supermarkets. At the other side of the spectrum, retailers may emphasize the intrinsic strengths of the conventional supermarket format, such as the higher service level and the more extensive choice offered to maximally differentiate themselves from the no-frills, limited-choice discounters.</p><p>To assess the relative merits of both strategies, insights are needed on the nature and extent of competition between supermarkets and discounters. On the one hand, retail competition is unlikely to be restricted completely to intraformat rivalry, as different formats essentially compete for business from most, if not all, consumer segments. On the other hand, the actual level of interformat competition is attenuated by the formats' degree of diversification <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Soberman 2005)</ref>. Given the substantial differences in positioning, assortment composition, pricing, and store environment, the extent of interformat competition is expected to be smaller than the extent of intraformat competition. However, it is hard to predict a priori how large this difference will be. It is also not clear whether interformat competition is symmetric. In other words, are conventional supermarkets and hard discounters equally vulnerable when a store of the other format enters their trading zone, and how does this vulnerability compare to the competitive impact of a same-format entry? Moreover, does this competitive threat vary with the number of incumbents of either format?</p><p>To answer these questions, we adapt recent empirical entry models from the industrial organization literature. Although several studies have already looked at interformat competition (as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), few considered simultaneously intra-and interformat competition. Within the subset that does so, only two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gijsbrechts et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, GonzÃ¡lez-Benito et al. 2005</ref> focused on the competition between supermarkets and discounters. In these studies, however, the presence of the different chains was predetermined (exogenous). As such, no insights could be obtained on how the extent of competition would vary as the number of players of either format varied. Such insights are one of the key outputs of our approach and are of vital importance (as recognized by the UK Competition Commission) in any competitive assessment. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The general idea of our approach is to infer information on the competitive impact of new entrants from the observed entry decisions of supermarkets and discounters in a broad cross section of local markets, as opposed to a focus on a single market (e.g., city) in most prior research. Rather than looking at consumers' choices among existing stores, we focus on the observed entry decisions of the different retailers and link these decisions to their unobservable profit. Retailers are assumed to only enter into (and stay in) a local market if profitable. This profitability falls with the entry of additional players, even though the extent of this decline may differ across formats. As such, observed market structures result from the different firms' profit-maximizing decisions, taking into account the expected conduct and performance of both incumbent and potential competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bresnahan and Reiss 1991b)</ref>.</p><p>The model we develop is very flexible. First, we allow for differential (asymmetric) effects both within and between formats. Moreover, we estimate the effect of the number of intra-and interformat incumbents in a semiparametric way. As such, we  allow for differential effects of different numbers of competitors and quantify whether the competitive impact increases (perhaps even disproportionally) as the number of incumbents increases-or alternatively, whether this effect is largest for the first entry of a certain format in a local market. We control for various local market characteristics when estimating the competitive impact of new entrants, and these effects are allowed to vary across formats. We apply our modeling approach to the German grocery industry, which offers a good setting to study how the discount format affects the competitive structure within the sector. Although the discount phenomenon is still growing in most Western countries, the German discount market has recently stabilized after almost a half century of continued growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Development</head><p>Store formats can be considered broad, competing categories that provide benefits to match the needs of different types of consumers and/or shopping situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(GonzÃ¡lez-Benito et al. 2005)</ref>. Although different formats provide different types of benefits, they increasingly compete with one another for the same consumers across overlapping product categories. This is referred to as interformat competition. In this paper, we focus on the competition between conventional supermarkets and discounters, as these two formats are among the most widespread formats in Europe. Retailers of the same format also compete for their respective share of the consumers' wallet, a phenomenon called intraformat competition. This is assumed to be more pronounced than the extent of interformat competition, because stores of the same format target a similar consumer segment with similar marketing policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fox et al. 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Intraformat Competition</head><p>Similar to brand competition, the degree of competition between stores is linked to the similarity of benefits they offer. Because store formats consist of relatively homogeneous groups of stores in terms of positioning strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fox et al. 2004)</ref>, we expect intense intraformat competition for both supermarkets and discounters.</p><p>We expect a particularly intense intraformat competition among supermarkets, as they are known to fight a fierce market-share battle because of an increasing saturation in their market, culminating in frequent promotional and advertising (re)actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rao and Syam 2001)</ref>. However, for discounters as well, we expect some extent of intraformat competition. Although they differentiate themselves less on dimensions such as assortment and service level, and even though they are known to use fewer advertising and promotional campaigns, they do compete on the price dimension. By estimating format-specific intraformat competitive effects, we will be able to infer whether, and to what extent, the intraformat competition is indeed more pronounced among supermarkets than among discounters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Interformat Competition</head><p>Supermarkets and discounters emphasize different consumer benefits and can therefore be seen as targeting different consumer segments. In practice, however, no full differentiation is expected. Although supermarkets usually have a much broader and deeper assortment, product offerings in both formats show considerable overlap. As such, stores in both formats may still experience considerable interformat competition.</p><p>We have no firm priors as to which format has the highest clout (or is least vulnerable). On the one hand, discounters may influence the overall price sensitivity in the market because of their focus on very aggressive prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(van Heerde et al. 2008</ref>). On the other hand, supermarkets can use frequent and/or deep price promotions to attract customers from the lower-price-tier discounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rajiv et al. 2002)</ref>. Also, other marketing instruments matter. Supermarkets often use the diversity in their assortment as the main selling proposition. Discounters, in turn, increasingly add national brands to their assortment to strengthen their competitive position relative to supermarkets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Deleersnyder et al. 2007</ref>). To compare the vulnerability and clout of both formats, we allow for asymmetric intercompetitive effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Control Variables</head><p>We control for several factors that may impact the attractiveness of a local market.</p><p>As population size can be considered a proxy of market size (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bresnahan and Reiss 1991b)</ref>, the demand for groceries is expected to increase with the number of inhabitants in the local market. This will have a positive impact on the profitability of both supermarkets and discounters. Income reduces price sensitivity as well as the preference for private labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ailawadi et al. 2001)</ref>. Given that discounters have a lower average price and more private labels than supermarkets, a higher income may shift demand from discounters to supermarkets. People of foreign ethnicity are usually more price sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>. We therefore expect demand to shift from supermarkets to the lower-price discounters in markets with more foreign households. Larger families have been shown to be more price sensitive as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hoch et al. 1995)</ref>. A larger average household size in the local market may therefore shift demand towards the grocery discounters. Older people (age) are, on average, more price sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hoch et al. 1995)</ref> and buy more store brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>, which may shift their preference from the supermarket to the discount format. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hoch et al. (1995)</ref> have shown that unemployed customers are usually more price sensitive. Furthermore, unemployed people have an increased inclination for private labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>. Therefore, we expect a demand shift from supermarkets to discounters in markets with a higher unemployment level.</p><p>As cities may attract business from smaller towns, we expect a negative impact on the profitability of both grocery formats when a city is nearby. We add the surface of the market to control for a potential spread of competitors, which may lead to a higher markup because of softened competition. On the other hand, when markets are larger, consumers incur more travel costs, which may decrease their spending on groceries. The net effect of these opposing forces is hard to predict beforehand. We add the distance to the nearest town to control for potentially overlapping markets (see Asplund and Sandin 1999 for a similar practice). When markets overlap, consumers may cross the border to do their shopping in a nearby town. Depending on the amount of demand attraction from and loss of demand to the nearby town, the effect on supermarket and discounter profitability may be positive or negative. As population growth can be considered a proxy for market-size expectations, we predict markets with a higher population growth to attract more supermarkets and discounters.</p><p>Given that hypermarkets will, to some extent, compete for the same business as supermarkets and discounters, we predict a negative impact of hypermarket presence on the profitability of both formats. Although not comparable in demand and cost factors to stores belonging to large chains, we predict a negative impact of independent supermarkets because of overlapping product offerings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model</head><p>Our empirical entry model can be situated in the "multiple-agent qualitative-response" models introduced in the industrial organization literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berry and Reiss 2007</ref> for a recent overview). This approach aims to make inferences about unobserved profits from the firms' observed entry decisions. It extends single-agent discrete-choice models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(McFadden 1982)</ref> by allowing for the interdependence between the agents' decisions, based on gametheoretic equilibrium concepts.</p><p>The starting point in an empirical entry model is the assumption that the firms' entry decisions form a Nash equilibrium. The conceptual problem, however, is that there may be multiple Nash equilibria for the same underlying conditions, making it impossible to unambiguously infer the unobserved profits from the observed entry decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bresnahan and Reiss 1991a</ref> for a discussion of this multiplicity problem). For example, in an entry game with two potential entrants, A and B, one Nash equilibrium may be that firm A enters, whereas firm B does not; and another Nash equilibrium may be that B enters, whereas A does not.</p><p>Various solutions to the multiplicity problem have been proposed in the literature. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bresnahan and Reiss (1991b)</ref> look at the aggregate entry outcome in a game with homogeneous firms, i.e., the total number of firms for which there is a unique prediction. This approach has recently been applied in marketing <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 29(3), pp. 456-473, Â© 2010 INFORMS</ref> to examine competition between video stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cleeren et al. 2006)</ref>. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berry (1992)</ref> allows for heterogeneous firms but explicitly introduces a sequential move structure so that a unique subgame perfect equilibrium results. In the above example, if firm A moves first, the unique equilibrium will be that firm A enters, whereas firm B does not. A recent application of this approach in a retail setting is by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. (2009)</ref>. A third approach to the multiplicity problem is offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Seim (2006)</ref>. She introduces incomplete information about the other firms' profitability. Under certain parameter conditions, this modification gives a unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Finally, Ciliberto and Tamer ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) cope with the multiplicity problem by focusing on the upper-and lower-bound entry probabilities. Their econometric methodology restricts the estimated parameters to a set instead of concentrating on point estimates and thus obtains partial identification without imposing homogeneous firms or an equilibrium refinement.</p><p>Our entry model is in the spirit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mazzeo (2002)</ref>, which is a combination of the first two approaches discussed above. He allows for two types of firms and assumes that firms of the same type are identical. He considers a Stackelberg entry game where firms sequentially decide on entry and type of firm. His sequential move game generates unique equilibrium predictions on the number of firms of each type. Our modeling approach contributes to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mazzeo (2002)</ref> in two ways. First, we show how to characterize the multiplicity of Nash equilibria in a general way, which is useful for other applications in this line of research (see the appendix for a detailed discussion). Second, we consider a modified version of Mazzeo's entry game, where firms have first chosen their product type (format) before deciding whether to enter and then follow a predetermined sequence of moves. 2 Not only is this approach more realistic in our setting, it also leads to a simpler likelihood function with only rectangular areas of integration. This decreases computational difficulties in estimating the model (see also <ref type="bibr">Berry and Reiss 2007 ( Â§3.2.</ref>3) on the computational difficulties with nonrectangular areas of integration).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Econometric Framework</head><p>Stores are assumed to belong to either of two formats, f = S D, where S and D represent, respectively, the supermarket and discount format. Profits for a chain of format f in a particular market are given by the latent variable f , which consists of a deterministic part, f N S N D , and a random part, f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f N S N D = f N S N D â f (1)</formula><p>with N S and N D , respectively, the number of supermarket and discount chains in town. 3 4 Marketing policies and shopping behaviors are rather homogeneous within each format, but different across formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fox et al. 2004</ref>). Therefore, we allow for different profit functions for supermarkets and discounters while assuming identical payoffs within a format (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mazzeo 2002)</ref>. The payoff for a chain that does not enter the market is set to zero. The unobserved firm profitability can be linked to the observed number of firms by explicitly modeling the entry process. A first assumption is that chains of the same format are substitutes, which implies a negative impact of own-format entry on profitability. More formally, we can formulate this assumption as follows:</p><p>Assumption 1 (Intraformat Substitutability).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S N S + 1 N D &lt; S N S N D D N S N D + 1 &lt; D N S N D</formula><p>In addition, different formats compete, to some extent, for business from the same consumers. Therefore, interformat competitors are assumed to have a negative impact on profitability. However, as the degree of substitutability was found to be larger within than between formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fox et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, GonzÃ¡lez-Benito et al. 2005</ref>, the decrease in store payoff is assumed to be largest when the entrant is of the same format. This amounts to the following assumptions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Assumption 2A (Interformat Substitutability). S N S N D + 1 â¤ S N S N D D N S + 1 N D â¤ D N S N D Assumption 2B (Stronger Intraformat than Interformat Substitutability). S N S + 1 N D â 1 &lt; S N S N D D N S â 1 N D + 1 &lt; D N S N D 461</formula><p>Assumption 2A implies that a store's profitability is decreasing with the number of chains of the other format. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In turn, Assumption 2B states that the negative impact of entry is larger when the entrant is of the same format than when the entrant is of the other format; i.e., there is stronger intraformat than interformat substitutability.</p><p>Based on these assumptions, we now derive the equilibrium number of chains of each format and construct the implied likelihood function. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We start from the Nash equilibrium concept, according to which all potential chains enter (and stay in) the market if and only if this is profitable in the long run, given the entry decisions of the other chains. More specifically, the market configuration n S n D is a Nash equilibrium if the random profit components S and D satisfy the following conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S n S + 1 n D &lt; S â¤ S n S n D D n S n D + 1 &lt; D â¤ D n S n D (2)</formula><p>Under (2), n S supermarket chains find it profitable to enter the market S n S n D â¥ 0 , whereas one extra supermarket would be unprofitable S n S + 1 n D &lt; 0 . Similarly, n D discount chains have nonnegative payoffs, whereas one more discounter would make a loss. Therefore, the conditions in (2) indeed describe a Nash equilibrium.</p><p>However, there may be many Nash equilibria for some realizations of the error terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bresnahan and Reiss 1991a)</ref>. This precludes straightforward econometric estimation, as there is no unique relationship between the unobserved profits and the observed entry decisions. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> visualizes the problem in a simple game with one potential entrant for each format. The vertical lines indicate when the supermarket chain can profitably enter, given that the discount chain also enters (line S 1 1 ) or given that the discount chain does not enter (line S 1 0 ). The horizontal lines are similar profitability lines for the discounter, given the supermarket's entry decision. For low realizations of both S and D , the unique Nash equilibrium is 1 1 ; i.e., both firms enter. Conversely, for large realizations of S and D the unique Nash equilibrium is 0 0 . Asymmetric market configurations 1 0 or 0 1 may also be obtained as unique Nash equilibria for a range of realizations of S and D (the upper left and bottom right areas). However, for intermediate realizations of both S and D , the market configurations 1 0 or 0 1 are both Nash equilibria, as indicated by the shaded rectangle. Intuitively, for these realizations there is a coordination problem, and either the supermarket or the discounter enters the market.</p><p>In the general case with more than one potential entrant of each format, the multiplicity problem becomes considerably more complicated. When n S n D is a Nash equilibrium, there may in principle be multiplicity with many other possible market configurations. However, under Assumptions 1 and 2, the multiplicity of equilibria can be characterized by three simple claims, as we show in the appendix.</p><p>Claim 1. n S n D may only show multiplicity with equilibria of the form n S + m n D â m , where m is a positive or negative integer. Thus, 2 3 can show multiplicity with, say, 3 2 or 0 5 but not with, say, 1 5 . Hence, there is a unique prediction for the total number of entrants n = n S + n D .</p></div>

For example, in a setting with up to two supermarkets and up to five discount chains, the entry sequence could be described as SSDDDDD (all supermarkets first), DDDDDSS (all discounters first), SDSDDDD (alternating with a supermarket first), DSDSDDD (alternating with a discounter first), etc. There are, therefore, many possible sequences. However, when looking at a market configuration n S n D only the first n = n S + n D moves in the assumed sequence are relevant. 7 Furthermore, only the number of players of each type during these first n moves matters, and their exact order of entry is otherwise irrelevant.</p><p>Formally, let the number of players of format S during the first n moves be n S (so that the number of format D players during this sequence is n D = n â n S .

Notice that the second and third terms in (4) equal zero if supermarkets and discounters have no direct impact on each other's profit functions. In this case there is no multiplicity problem, and thus only the first term remains. The model then reduces to a bivariate ordered probit model with a correlation parameter .

As for the level of competition, we estimate (as described above) both intra-and interformat competitive effects. In addition, we control for the impact of other market characteristics that may influence the local market potential. We allow for asymmetric competitive effects by estimating per-type intra-and interformat competition. In addition, given that supermarkets and discounters may attract different consumer segments , we estimate format-specific parameters for the control variables. Therefore, s N S N D and D N S N D are specified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S N S N D = S ln POP + S X â N S S â N D S N S D N S N D = D ln POP + D X â N D D â N S D N D (6)</formula><p>where POP is the market population, and X is a vector of market characteristics. The parameters can be interpreted as evidence that the entry of a chain of format f has a negative impact on the performance of chains of the same format. Similarly, the parameters N âf f measure the effect of interformat players on store profitability. A significant increase in these parameter values for a larger number of other-type chains indicates a significant interformat competitive effect. We divide the</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">N âf f</formula><p>parameters by N f to reflect that the total competitive impact of an other-format competitor is actually carried by (spread out over) all same-format players. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The parameters estimated from ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) can be used directly to test the impact of the covariates on the store performance of supermarket and discount chains. However, they can also be used to derive entry thresholds, i.e., the minimum market sizes required to support a given number of chains. These thresholds offer insights on how entry affects the extent of competition. Specifically, if an additional chain provides a strong constraint on firm profits, the entry threshold to carry the extra chain raises more than proportionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bresnahan and Reiss 1991b)</ref>. The entry threshold T N f N âf f is defined by the population level at which the chains of format f would break even given that there are N f chains of the same format and N âf other-format chains.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Sample Composition and Dependent</head><p>Variables Our main database consists of the addresses of all supermarkets and discounters in Germany in 2006. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carree and Dejardin (2006)</ref>, we analyze our data at the town level. In Germany, these towns correspond to the "Gemeindes." As is common in the empirical entry literature, we exclude too-small towns, which are unlikely to be self-contained. Therefore, we eliminate all local markets with a population smaller than 3,000 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. 2009</ref> for a similar practice). Similarly, we also exclude all towns with a population of more than 25,000 because those markets are likely to contain submarkets (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carree and Dejardin 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Data on the number of supermarket and discounter chains were obtained from Trade Dimensions, a data provider specializing in store-by-store data for the retail industry. This database additionally includes information on the format of all stores. We consider discounters and supermarkets. The former are defined as food retail shops that offer a limited product range, a small depth of assortment, simple shop equipment, and a focus on aggressive prices. The latter include nondiscount stores with a sales area between 400 and 2,500 square metres (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">GonzÃ¡lez-Benito et al. 2005</ref> for similar definitions).</p><p>As indicated before, the German grocery industry is highly concentrated, with a few large companies dominating both the supermarket and discounter format. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. (2009)</ref>, we focus on the number of large chains present in the market, because independent stores are hardly comparable in terms of demand and cost conditions. For the discount format, we consider Aldi, Tengelmann (Plus), Schwarz (Lidl), Rewe (Penny), Edeka (e.g., Netto), and NORMA. We hereby capture the complete discount format. In terms of the supermarket format, we measure whether or not the Edeka, Rewe, and Tengelmann groups have a supermarket in the local market. Together, these three companies capture more than 90% of the total sales of the supermarket format. To control for the few independent stores left, we add them as an exogenous variable to the profit functions. Because there are too few local markets with more than two supermarket chains or more than five discount chains to make reliable estimates of their effects on the extent of intra-and interformat competition, we do not take these observations into account. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In total, we consider 3,593 local markets, with an average population size of 8,184. Note that our geographical scope is much broader than in most previous studies inferring interformat competition from consumer choice data (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> for an overview), as these were often restricted to a single city (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">GonzÃ¡lez-Benito et al. 2005)</ref> or metropolitan area (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fox et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> presents summary statistics on the relative occurrence of the various market structures.

In contrast, the number of towns with zero, one, or two discount chains are more or less comparable, accounting for 26% (zero), 25% (one), and 22% (two) of the sample. A minority of towns have three, four, or five different discount chains (respectively, 16%, 9%, and 3%).

Income is measured by the average net income (in 1,000 euro) per inhabitant, and the ethnic composition is operationalized as the percentage of households with a foreign nationality (foreign hh). Household composition is captured by the average household size. We operationalize age as the percentage of people 65 years or older, and unemployment as the percentage of the working population (18 to 64 years old) that is unemployed In addition, we create a dummy variable to indicate the nearby presence of a city within a radius of 10 km 14 and include the surface (in 100 km 2 ) of the market. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Asplund and Sandin (1999)</ref>, we measure the distance to nearest town as the Euclidean distance from the town centre to the nearest town centre (in kilometres). Furthermore, we calculate the percentage change in population size over the last two years to measure population growth (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bresnahan and Reiss 1991b</ref> for a similar practice). We operationalize the presence of hypermarkets with a Marketing Science 29(3), pp. 456-473, Â© 2010 INFORMS dummy variable that indicates whether a hypermarket is situated in a town within 25 km of the considered town centre. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The 25 km cutoff value is based on the trading area of hypermarkets reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campo and Gijsbrechts (2004)</ref>.

(2006)</ref> also found that the profit implications for supermarkets are limited when Wal-Mart enters their local market. An underlying interpretation is that the discounter (or Wal-Mart) draws the pricesensitive consumers out of the market for the product categories it carries, allowing supermarkets to focus on the more profitable price-insensitive segment and increase prices on their unique product offerings. Moreover, as consumers can save expenditures on the product categories offered by the discounter, they have more disposable income for the other categories of the supermarket <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gielens et al. 2008</ref>). Discounters may also initially draw their business mainly from other grocery formats, such as hypermarkets and mom-and-pop stores. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Significant and substantial interformat competition is observed from the third discounter onwards.

When the number of discounters in a market increases, the amount of product categories uniquely offered by supermarkets is likely to decrease, which reduces the opportunities of diversification (and associated higher prices) through assortment. Moreover, because more discounters are present, their combined impact on consumers' price sensitivity will be larger, increasing the pressure on supermarkets to decrease their prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hausman and Leibtag 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A similar pattern of interformat competition is found for the discounters. The first supermarket does not increase the extent of rivalry significantly p &gt; 0 1 . In contrast, the breakeven market size of a discounter increases by a significant 12% when the second supermarket enters p &lt; 0 05 . Although the formats thus appear differentiated for the first entrant (confirming our earlier results for the supermarkets), an interformat competitive effect for discounters becomes apparent when more supermarkets are present in the market. No significant differences are found between the interformat ratios obtained for both formats, suggesting no asymmetric effects in terms of their vulnerability and clout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Control Variables</head><p>We controlled for a number of covariates that may impact the attractiveness of a local market. In addition to their main function as controls, we can also interpret the parameter estimates to assess their impact on the profitability of supermarkets and discounters.</p><p>Income has a negative impact on discounter profits, which is consistent with an increased price sensitivity and private label inclination for low-income families <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ailawadi et al. 2001)</ref>. The percentage of foreign households increases discounter profitability substantially, whereas it has a negative impact on supermarkets. Foreigners have been shown to be more price sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>, which may shift their demand from the higher-priced supermarkets to discounters. The average household size has a positive impact on discounter profitability, consistent with a higher price sensitivity for larger families <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>. The percentage of elderly has a positive effect on the profitability of both formats. Older people are more price sensitive and buy more private labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hoch 1996)</ref>, which may explain their patronage of the low-price discount stores. However, older people also spend more in supermarkets. This may be due to a higher availability of time, which makes them more promotion sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(DrÃ¨ze and Vanhuele 2004)</ref>. This increases their likelihood to also visit promotion-intensive supermarkets. The percentage of unemployed has a positive effect on discounter performance and a negative impact on supermarket profits. This result is consistent with an increased price sensitivity and inclination toward private labels by unemployed people <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hoch et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Hoch 1996</ref>, resulting in a demand shift from supermarkets to discounters. The presence of a nearby city has a significant negative impact on the profitability of both formats, reflecting the predicted attraction effect of cities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carree and Dejardin 2006</ref> for a similar result). Similarly, market surface has a negative impact on the profitability of both formats, suggesting that the negative demand effect-caused by larger travel costs for consumers in larger markets-is larger than the positive markup effect caused by a decrease in competition because of a larger spread of stores in larger markets. The distance to the nearest town has a negative effect in both profit equations, indicating that nearby markets positively influence the profitability of both formats. This suggests that people from nearby markets cross the market border to purchase part of their groceries and thereby increase the demand within the local market (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bresnahan and Reiss 1991b</ref> for a similar finding). Furthermore, population growth has a significant positive impact on discounter profitability, which indicates that past growth plays a role in determining the effective market size. Rapidly growing markets attract discounters even if the market as such is not large at this moment. No such effect is found for supermarkets. Finally, both the presence of a nearby hypermarket and the number of independent supermarkets have the expected negative influence on the profits of both formats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Simulations</head><p>To provide further insight into the economic significance of the estimated parameters, we simulate the effect of an increase in the control variables on the total number of supermarkets and discounters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mazzeo 2002</ref> for a similar practice). The results can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>. Note that the reported numbers indicate the percentage change in the total number of supermarkets and discounters after a 1% increase in the value of the control variable in each market. The numbers can thus be interpreted as elasticities.</p><p>For example, we find that an increase of 1% in the unemployment level in every market leads to a decrease in the total number of supermarkets of 1.9%, and an increase in the number of discounters of 4.6%. Note that we can split this total effect into a direct effect-caused by the estimated effect of the covariate on supermarket and discounter profitability-and an indirect effect that is linked to a change in the number of interformat competitors. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> As such, for the supermarkets, the direct effect (â1 3%) contributes about </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Population +0 7 +1 0 Income +0 03 â0 4 Foreign hh â1 +2 1 Household size +0 2 +0 7 Age +2 3 +2 8 Unemployment â1 9 +4 6 Surface â0 1 â0 1 Distance to nearest town â0 1 â0 2 Population growth 0 0 Other supermarkets â0 05 â0 01</formula><p>Note.

In contrast, for discounters the total positive effect is almost exclusively caused by a direct positive effect of 4.3% (i.e., 95% of the total effect).</p><p>Another interesting result relates to the percentage of foreign households. An increase of 1% in the percentage of foreigners in every market leads to 1% fewer supermarkets and 2.1% more discounters. For supermarkets, this total effect is due to a direct effect of â0 7% (i.e., 70% of the total effect) and an indirect effect of â0 3% (i.e., 30% of the total effect). For discounters, the total positive effect is again mainly because of a large positive direct effect (2%, which is 95% of the total effect).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Robustness Checks</head><p>Four sets of robustness checks were conducted. As such, we assess the sensitivity of our findings with respect to our sample selection criteria, as well as with regard to the sequential entry assumption that we adopted. Furthermore, we acknowledge that some firms may operate chains of both formats, and we see whether this affects our results. Finally, we test for the sensitivity of our results with respect to the fact that certain chains may have multiple stores in a particular market. 21</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Sensitivity to Sample Selection Criteria</head><p>Our results are based on a sample of towns with a population between 3,000 and 25,000. First, we check the robustness with respect to the upper and lower bound of these population criteria and increase/decrease them by 10%. Furthermore, we use the population density as an additional selection criterion to prevent the occurrence of submarkets in the considered markets (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schaumans and Verboven 2008)</ref>. Specifically, we also exclude towns with a population density of more than 632 inhabitants per square kilometer. This cutoff corresponds to the 5% most densely populated towns in Germany. Moreover, we check for the robustness of our results with regard to the exclusion of observations with three supermarkets or six discounters. These were not considered because there were too few observations to make a separate category of market structures for them. As such, we create a 2+ category for the supermarkets, which also incorporates the observations with three supermarket chains. Similarly, for discounters we construct a 5+ category including the markets with six discount chains (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cleeren et al. 2006</ref> for a similar practice).</p><p>The results in all validation samples turned out to be very robust for the findings reported above. Both formats experience an extensive intraformat rivalry, although for discounters this is only apparent from the third entrant. Furthermore, in all samples intraformat competition is asymmetric in that it is more pronounced for supermarkets than for discounters. Also, with regard to the extent of interformat competition, we find similar patterns as reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. Specifically, interformat competition is only significant for supermarkets from the third discounter onwards, whereas only the second supermarket has a significant impact on a discounter's profitability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Sensitivity to Order-of-Entry Assumption</head><p>To ensure uniqueness of equilibria for every condition of the error terms, we assumed sequential entry. Given that the supermarket format was developed long before the discounters, we presumed that supermarkets entered the market first. Because we observe up to two supermarkets and up to five discounters across all markets, this amounts to the sequence SSDDDDD, resulting in the likelihood contribution given by (5). To check the robustness of our results with regard to this assumption, we also considered two alternative sequences of moves using the more general likelihood function (4); i.e., all discounters entered the market first (DDDDDSS) and the sequence SDDDDDS. Both the parameter estimates and the estimated entry threshold ratios were very robust in both scenarios, and the same conclusions as summarized in the previous paragraph held. This indicates the insensitivity of our results with respect to the order-of-entry assumption, an observation also made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Einav (2009)</ref> and Mazzeo (2002).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Sensitivity to Firms Owning</head><p>Multiple Formats The same parent firm may be present in both formats. In that case, interformat competition could be Marketing Science 29(3), pp. 456-473, Â© 2010 INFORMS less intense, as firms may want to avoid excessive cannibalization. In 788 (22%) of the markets in our sample, one of the firms operated both discount stores and supermarkets. To assess the sensitivity of our results to these specific markets, the model was reestimated without these observations. Again the same conclusions were obtained. The only difference was that while a second supermarket had a (marginally) significant effect on discounter profits in the full sample, a (marginally) insignificant effect was found in the limited sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Sensitivity to Chains Owning Multiple Stores</head><p>We model the presence of supermarket and discounter chains in local markets. However, a particular chain may actually have more than one store in a given local market, which may again have an influence on the actual extent of intra-and/or interformat competition. We therefore ran 9 (10) additional validation analyses in which each time we deleted those markets that had, respectively, more than one (i) Aldi store (138 markets), (ii) Edeka discounter ( <ref type="formula">146</ref>), (iii) NORMA store ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), (iv) Rewe discounter ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>), (v) Lidl store ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), (vi) Tengelmann discounter (48), and (vii) Edeka ( <ref type="formula">387</ref>), (viii) Tengelmann ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), or (ix) Rewe ( <ref type="formula">146</ref>) supermarket. The threshold ratios were once more very robust and led to the same substantive conclusions. The only difference was that the first interformat threshold ratio for discounters (INTER_R 1 D ) became marginally significant in the case where all markets with more than one Edeka supermarket were deleted. In that case, the breakeven market size of discounters becomes higher as soon as one supermarket is present (rather than from the second onwards). However, our key insight that the first discounter does not affect the breakeven market size required by supermarkets was very robust in all instances, as were all findings on the extent of intraformat competition. This was also the case in the extreme setting where we deleted all markets (747, or 21%) where at least one of the chains had more than one store, even though discounters then start to have an impact on supermarkets from the second (rather than the third) chain onward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Directions for Future Research</head><p>We used an empirical entry model to study competition between grocery discounters and traditional supermarkets in Germany. We find evidence for intense competition within both the supermarket and discount format. The former finding supports the common notion that supermarkets are engaged in fierce competition. However, we also find strong evidence of intraformat competition between discounters. Price comparisons are easy, especially among stores with few promotional activities. Additional discounters therefore not only attract customers from the more expensive supermarkets, but they also compete with one another. We also quantified the extent of interformat competition. Common wisdom suggests that the entry of a discount store should have an immediate negative impact on supermarkets' performance. This is indeed intuitive if one concentrates on market share and/or volume as a performance metric. Focusing on profitability, however, we find that the two first discounters have no significant effect on the performance of supermarkets in the area. This result is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhu et al. (2006)</ref>, who point out that supermarkets can focus on the more profitable price-insensitive segment when a discounter is present. When more discounters enter the local market, however, things start to change. First, the discounters' combined impact on the general price sensitivity becomes larger, putting extra pressure on incumbent supermarkets to also decrease prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hausman and Leibtag 2007)</ref>, which reduces their profit margins. Moreover, unless the assortments of competing discounters overlap completely, a smaller fraction of the supermarkets' broad assortment will not be carried by any of the discounters. Discounters increasingly try to differentiate themselves by carrying a limited number of leading national brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Deleersnyder et al. 2007</ref>). As more discounters add national brands, the selling proposition of supermarkets as the place to be to buy leading national brands becomes eroded.</p><p>Many conventional supermarket chains are currently starting their own discount banner. For example, the traditional French supermarket chains Carrefour (with ED) and IntermarchÃ© (with Netto) have added discount banners to their portfolio <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carboni 2004)</ref>. Similar developments are underway in the United Kingdom. Our results suggest that early discount entrants can avoid cannibalizing the profits of their supermarkets in the area. Managers seem to realize this sense of urgency. Discussing the type of lessons drawn from observing other retailers, including Aldi, the CEO of Tesco argues: "The trick in this business is to watch everyone and to learn from them quicker than they learn from you" <ref type="bibr">(Grocer 2007, p. 7)</ref>.</p><p>Several insights on the extent of intra-and interformat competition between discounters and supermarkets were obtained, even though the data requirements to attain these results were quite limited. To do so, however, we had to make a number of model assumptions. Relaxing these assumptions offers various avenues for future research.</p><p>First, we limited our attention to the German grocery industry. A replication of our analysis in other countries would be useful. However, the model in this paper assumes a long-term equilibrium. Specifically, we assume that the observed number of stores per type coincides with the profit-maximizing number of players. Given the maturity of both formats in Germany (PlanetRetail 2006a), this appears to be a defendable assumption. However, in other countries, the nature of competition in the grocery industry is still evolving. Our model can be used to verify our findings in these other settings once the examined formats have reached the saturation stage. Alternatively, capturing the dynamics in evolving markets could provide additional interesting insights as well. Although the estimation of dynamic games is still computationally challenging, some recent research efforts in the area are very promising (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chintagunta et al. 2006</ref> for a similar observation).</p><p>Second, in this paper, we focus exclusively on supermarkets and discounters, as they can be considered the main local competitors. Although we considered the hypermarket presence as an exogenous control variable; future research could endogenize this entry decision. This would not only involve extending the model to allow for more than two types but also require accounting for the fact that hypermarkets compete in larger geographic markets. One could also envision modeling the entry decision of each chain in our sample separately to capture withinformat heterogeneity. This would not only allow us to estimate chain-specific competitive effects, but the results would also provide insights on the role of multimarket contact. Although an extension of the number of types renders the econometric specification more difficult given the complex regions of integration for the unobservables, simulation techniques can be used to compute the required integrals (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhu et al. 2009</ref> for a recent application). Finally, we derived inferences on the overall level of competitiveness among discounters and supermarkets under different market structures. It would be useful to assess in future research whether this overall level can be attributed mostly to competition along the price dimension, the promotional strategy, the assortment composition, and/or the service dimension. Although it would be difficult to get accurate measures on each of these dimensions for all (or even a subset of) players in the market, the insights obtained in that way could complement our more aggregate insights.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>is not necessary to divide the own-formatN f f parameters by N f ; this would simply amount to a rescaling of the parameters,</figDesc></figure>

We first provide an example to show the possible complexities and then provide a general characterization of the multiplicity of Nash equilibria.</p><p>Consider an example where up to two supermarkets and up to two discounters can enter. Figure A.1 shows the possible equilibria in the S D space. The horizontal and vertical lines have a similar interpretation as in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Figure A.1</ref> shows that there are many areas with two equilibria: 2 0 and 1 1 ; 2 1 and 1 2 ; 0 2 and 1 1 , and 1 0 and 0 1 . Furthermore, there is an area with three possible equilibria: 2 0 , 1 1 , and 0 2 . This suggests a very large number of possibilities. Nevertheless, not every combination of outcomes is possible. For example, there are no areas where 2 0 shows multiplicity with 1 0 or 0 1 . Furthermore, whenever 2 0 shows multiplicity with 0 2 , it also shows multiplicity with a third equilibrium, 1 1 . These properties actually hold more generally and lead to a drastically simplified characterization of the multiplicity problem.</p><p>Consider this general characterization. Suppose that Assumption 2A holds with strict inequality. In this specification, supermarkets and discounters are dependent on each other, which gives rise to a multiplicity problem. In principle, a Nash equilibrium n S n D may show multiplicity with any outcome of the form n S + m S n D + m D . Below, we prove three important claims. First, n S n D may only show multiplicity with equilibria of the form n S + m n D â m , where m is a positive or negative integer (Claim 1). Thus, 2 3 can show multiplicity with, say, 1 4 or 0 5 but not with, say, 1 5 . Second, n S n D necessarily shows multiplicity with n S â 1 n D + 1 and n S + 1 n D â 1 (Claim 2). Third, whenever n S n D shows multiplicity with n S + m n D â m , the multiplicity area is necessarily a subset of the multiplicity area with n S + 1 n D â 1 for m &gt; 0, and a subset of the multiplicity area with n S â 1 n D + 1 for m &lt; 0 (Claim 3). Taken together, these claims imply that the area of S D for which n S n D shows multiplicity with any other Nash equilibria is simply given by the areas of overlap with n S + 1 n D â 1 and n S â 1 n D + 1 . This greatly facilitates the construction of the likelihood function.</p><p>To show these claims, define A as the set of S D for which n S n D is a Nash equilibrium, as given by conditions (2). In addition, define B m S m D as the set of S D for which both n S n D and n S + m S n D + m D are Nash equilibria, where m S and m D may be any integer.</p><p>Proof. Suppose to the contrary that when n S n D is a Nash equilibrium there are also equilibria of the form n S + m S n D + m D with m S = âm D . We consider all possible cases and show that we obtain a contradiction.</p><p>(i) m S &gt; 0 and m D &gt; 0. Then the inequalities (2), Assumption 2A, and Assumption 1, respectively, imply that S â¤</p><p>This contradicts with the inequalities (2), which imply that  (2, 0) / (1, 1) </p></div>			</div>
