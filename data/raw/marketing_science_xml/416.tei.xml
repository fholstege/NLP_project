<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Research from Nielsen in 4Q 2011 found that 45% of Americans who own tablets use them daily while watching television; in fact, 26% noted simultaneous use of both media forms throughout the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Steinberg 2012)</ref>. The habits of smartphone users are also similar. The emergence of such multimedia consumption paints a worrisome picture of consumers who are "snacking on short amounts of time with different types of media channels," according to Unilever's Global Director, Media Insights, Patti Wakeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Steinberg 2012)</ref>. Many companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola are experimenting with cross-media advertising strategies, such as running a traditional print ad along with videos on the firm's website or television ads. This is consistent with an integrated marketing communications (IMC) philosophy of a cohesive message across multichannel media forms. However, as consumers rapidly switch and simultaneously consume multiple media forms, the challenge for the advertising creative has never been higher. Moreover, although the success of IMC programs hinges on the ability to harness and leverage potential synergies-i.e., "the combined effect of multiple activities exceeds the sum of their individual effects" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Belch and Belch 1998, p. 11;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Naik and Raman 2003)</ref>-there is little empirical guidance as to what combination of media forms and timing are best for tracking and targeting the "minnows" described above <ref type="bibr">(Mantrala 2002, Danaher and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Rossiter 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal is to help media planners better track and target consumers in today's complex and rapidly changing media environment. The challenge is to Lin, Venkataraman, and Jap: Media Multiplexing Behavior Marketing Science 32(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">310-324, © 2013 INFORMS 311</ref> track where a target audience may be at any given point in time and predict which media or combination of media their target audience is likely to consume given potential intermedia synergies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schultz 2002)</ref>. To this end, we develop a predictive model of consumer choice of media in a multichannel context that can be applied within a product category or vertical. This represents a significant advancement over the literature on media choice modeling, because much of this work assumes that media are consumed one channel (or type) at a time; this implies a competitive model of time and attention exposure and is inconsistent with an IMC perspective.</p><p>We investigate the phenomenon of media multiplexing, whereby people serially (and potentially simultaneously) consume small, even incomplete "chunks" of media within a small period of time and may then switch to the consumption of programming/content on another media channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pilotta et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Pilotta and Schultz 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Smith et al. 2006</ref>). The term "multiplexing" has its genesis in the telecommunications literature to describe signals or messages in a multichannel system. Our preference for this term rather than "coconsumption" is to allow for the possibility of simultaneous multimedia consumption, rather than the consumption of only two media forms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pilotta and Schultz (2005)</ref> claim that the experience of media multiplexing is a shift in the logic of cultural perception and attunement from successive experience to simultaneity and synthesis of media that, in turn, restructures attention.</p><p>We calibrate a consumer-level demand model using a proprietary data set of individual-specific media consumption. To account for media multiplexing, we relax the discrete-choice assumption of commonly employed choice models, allowing for richer sources of intermedia dependencies, including (1) media switching and coconsumption, (2) potential complementarity and substitutability of the channels, (3) observed and unobserved consumer heterogeneity and process variation (e.g., satiation), and (4) day-, time-, and media-specific variables such as technology penetration and attention span. These factors rationalize consumers' media choices, be they single media or multiplexing.</p><p>The IMC literature suggests that synergies across advertising and communication efforts exist and ought to be systematically leveraged. To this end, we introduce a utility function that directly models such cross-channel media complementarities through interactive effects of the satiation parameters of own and joint consumption of various media types. This allows us to quantify and evaluate the magnitude and direction of their combined usage. Although many suggest that multiplexing is valuable, there are neither theories nor evidence as to how various media forms should work together. We offer empirical findings to inform this debate and use the models to address the following questions:</p><p>1. What is the improvement in predicting consumers' media choices if we account for intermedia multiplexing? And what explains their media choice?</p><p>Using a data-driven approach, we examine controllable media-specific factors, attention and penetration, that impact substitution patterns across media alternatives. Ceteris paribus, the baseline utility for television is the highest relative to computer, radio, print, or any possible combination of these alternatives alone. However, the cross-media effect of attention on a media-specific baseline utility suggests interesting asymmetries across the media alternatives. For example, consumers with high attention for the computer are unlikely to multiplex traditional forms of media (radio, print, and television). In contrast, consumers with high attention for these traditional media options have higher utility for multiplexing all forms of media (including new and traditional).</p><p>2. For a given target audience, which media are substitutes and which are complements? What are the implications for old versus new media and combinations thereof?</p><p>We are also able to identify the consumer's differential utility and marginal rate of substitution for each media and, hence, which media they are willing to give up. We find that print media is the form that is most easily switched away from, although this rate can be reduced if it is paired with other forms of media. We also find that all forms of old mediai.e., television, radio, and print-benefit when multiplexed with new media-i.e., the Internet.</p><p>Collectively, our findings identify viable old and new joint media combinations that could be exploited and underscore the need for multimedia channel collaboration over competition. Our research also serves as a critical first step toward a more detailed understanding of consumers' media choices, taking into account media channel interdependencies and multiplexing behavior. For example, equipped with the proposed model, consumers' media choices, and consumer-directed advertising schedules, one can extend the models proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rust and Alpert (1984)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Rust (1996), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wilbur (2008)</ref> to a multimedia channels setting. Although our data do not allow us to examine issues such as return on investment directly, they allow us to provide some insights that would move us toward that goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The IMC literature emphasizes effective interaction, integration, and deployment of various forms of media-for example, general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relationsto clarify and make communications consistent.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Vakratsas and Ambler 1999)</ref>, radio, and Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Manchanda et al. 1999)</ref>. Within the focal media, these studies either measure the effectiveness of these individual channels for consumer-directed advertising or model the consumers' single-media choice problem such as the selection of television program channels <ref type="bibr">Alpert 1984, Shachar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Emerson 2000)</ref>, thereby generating insights for the creation and scheduling of TV content. To the best of our knowledge, consumers' choice of multiple media (be it sequential or simultaneous) has received minimal, if any, attention in the current literature. One exception in this vein is <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wendel and Dellaert (2005)</ref>, who found that a media channel's perceived benefits and synergies across usage situations affect consumers' media channel consideration.</p><p>There is also a related stream of research examining firm-side media choice within an IMC setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Naik and Raman (2003)</ref> demonstrate the sales gains from advertising across two media (i.e., television and print). Their study is the first to demonstrate the retail-level gains from honing media synergies.</p><p>Our study also complements studies on aggregated synergies in marketing-mix elements (e.g., price and advertising combinations) such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Naik et al. (2005)</ref>. However, they do not examine individual media choice decisions, and therefore, their ability to predict consumer sensitivity to media exposure is limited. Generally speaking, research on synergy focuses on the consequential impact of joint media consumption; we will focus on synergy as reduced satiation stemming from the complementarities that arise from multiplexed media consumption. In other words, if a consumer typically consumes one hour of radio and one hour of television, the multiplexed option might result in three hours of the complementary consumption of both.</p><p>There is little literature that aids the planning of communications strategies across multiple media using individual consumer preferences. An exception to this is <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smith et al. (2006)</ref>, who use individual-calllevel data across print, direct mail, event sponsorships, radio, computer, and retail sources as inputs to the firm's lead generation process. Their descriptive model accommodates serial correlation across the media sources, carryover effects, and concave response functions but does not address potential substitution or complementary interdependencies; our approach does. We draw on recent advancements in the multicategory choice modeling literatures in marketing and economics to develop a multivariate discrete/continuous choice model that is utility-theory consistent so as to rationalize individual-specific media multiplexing while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and satiation.</p><p>Whereas research in the grocery retail context has increasingly examined the cross-category effects of marketing-mix activities (i.e., how consumers' purchases in one category are related to their purchase in another), the goal of this literature is to help firms better coordinate their marketing activities across categories and within each category so as to maximize profits. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Manchanda et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chib et al. (2002)</ref> focus on recovering category interdependencies using household-level multicategory purchasing decisions and whether consumer preferences and sensitivity to marketing activities are household and/or category specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainslie and Rossi 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Seetharaman et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Mehta 2007</ref>. Cross-category (or product) interdependencies are accommodated in a variety of ways ranging from nonstructural specifications such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Manchanda et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Edwards and Allenby (2003)</ref>, to a more semistructural one such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dubé (2004)</ref>, to a completely structural approach as undertaken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref>. Our approach is akin to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Song and Chintagunta (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> in that multicategory interdependencies (i.e., media channels in our case) are accommodated via a behaviorally consistent utility-maximization framework while accounting for a mixture of discrete (e.g., which media to consume?) and continuous (e.g., how much to consume?) choices.</p><p>To summarize, we contribute to and advance the IMC and multicategory choice literature as follows:</p><p>(i) We complement <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Naik and Raman (2003)</ref> in that they utilize aggregate advertising data to speak to issues at the firm or market level, whereas we rely on individual-choice data across media and focus on predicting media choice(s) at the individual consumer level. Although we are also interested in synergies, our perspective focuses on media consumption, consistent with the firm's advertising challenge.</p><p>(ii) Methodologically speaking, our utility theoryconsistent demand model incorporates the simultaneous consumption of different media, time effects, media technology penetration, and other exogenous factors. Instead of treating media choices as independent of each other, we explicitly model the determinants of a consumer's media choice and interdependencies between media within a single utility specification.</p><p>(iii) Further, we introduce a model form for assessing complementarity that expands on both <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref>. These papers represent the prevailing model form for discrete/continuous choice in the multicategory choice literature but do not model complementarity. Our innovation is to allow separate satiation parameters for such joint choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Empirical Model</head><p>Consumer choice is characterized by the multiplexing of K media alternatives such as Internet, television, radio, and print media within a one-hour period. The choice of a one-hour period is largely a function of the data structure, which is collected via self-report diaries over half-hour increments. We develop the model along one-hour increments but note that there is no theoretical reason why the increment should be one hour, or more, or less. In the estimation section we also observe the model's flexibility to one-hour, half-hour, or even two-hour increments.</p><p>Our objective is to predict discrete incidences of individual i's media consumption choice k (or multiple choices when consumer engages in multiplexing) and continuous quantities of media time allocations t k while accounting for potential interdependencies across media alternatives. We employ a stochastic utility specification variant of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> that incorporates important media planning decisions such as a timing effect (including time of the day and day of the week), observed and unobserved consumer heterogeneity, attention span, and media penetration. We compare the proposed model with a single discrete/continuous model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hanemann 1984)</ref> in later sections to show the improvement in model fit and prediction.</p><p>We specify the utility derived in a one-hour block. The functional form is a generalized variant of the translated consumer-expenditure-system function given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U i t = K k=1 k k ik t k k + 1 k − 1 (1)</formula><p>where U t is a quasi-concave, increasing, and continuously differentiable function with respect to the dependent variable of the continuous consumption quantity (K × 1)-vector t (t k ≥ 0 for all k), which is the time allocated to each media alternative. Multiplexing is accommodated by summating across K media alternatives, whereas k is the baseline utility for time invested in media activity k; k and k are translation parameters associated with good k.</p><p>A multiplicative random element is introduced to the baseline marginal utility of each media option as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ik = z ik ik = z ik • e ik (2)</formula><p>where z ik is a set of attributes characterizing media k and the decision maker, including baseline constants, time of the day, day of the week, demographics, attention levels, and media penetration, and ik captures idiosyncratic (unobserved) characteristics that impact the baseline utility for media k for individual i. The term z ik is further parameterized as exp z ik , which then leads to the following form for the baseline random utility associated with media k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z ik ik = exp z ik + ik (3)</formula><p>The z ik vector in the above equation includes a constant. The overall random utility function of Equation (1) then takes the following form, with the first good being the outside good:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U i t = k k k exp z ik + ik • t k k + 1 k − 1 (4)</formula><p>From the econometrician's perspective, the individual is maximizing random utility subject to the binding linear budget constraint that K k=1 t k = T , where T is a total budget of 60 minutes.</p><p>In our identification setting, k is further parameterized as exp Z k / 1 + exp Z k , and separate values (rather, the corresponding functional forms) are estimated for all media alternatives including the outside good. The values for all media (except the outside good) are constrained to equal 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Optimal Time Allocations</head><p>Optimal time allocation occurs when an individual consumer i choose the media and quantities that maximize his or her utility within one-hour. This is achieved by forming the Lagrangian and applying the Kuhn-Tucker (KT) conditions. We derive the individual-specific consumption vector for the random utility-specification subject to the linear time constraint. For convenience, we drop the subscript i for now. The resulting Lagrangian is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L = k k k exp z k + k t k k + 1 k − 1 − K k=1 t k − T<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where is the multiplier associated with the constraint (i.e., the marginal utility of total time).</p><p>The first-order conditions for the optimal time allocations (the t * k values) are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">exp z k + k t * k k + 1 k −1 − = 0 if t * k &gt; 0 k = 1 2 K exp z k + k t * k k + 1 k −1 − &lt; 0 if t * k = 0 k = 1 2 K (6)</formula><p>The optimal demand satisfies the conditions in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) plus the total time constraint K k=1 t * k = T . We specify an extreme value distribution for k and assume its independence of z k (k = 1 2 K) and its independent distribution across media. Let V k be Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 310-324, © 2013 INFORMS defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V k = z k + k − 1 ln t * k + 1 k = 1 2 3 K (7)</formula><p>Also, let c i = 1 − i / i + t * i ; following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref>, we obtain the following probability expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P t * 2 t * 3 t * M 0 0 0 = M i=1 c i M i=1 1 c i M i=1 e V i K k=1 e V k M M − 1 ! (8)</formula><p>When an outside good is present, for identification purposes, let t 1 1 = e 1 . Then, the utility functional form is modified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">U t = 1 1 exp 1 t 1 1 + K k=2 k k exp z k + k t k k + 1 k − 1 (9)</formula><p>There is no translation parameter 1 for the first good, because it is always consumed. This feature allows us to accommodate media consumption and other nonmedia activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Unobserved Heterogeneity</head><p>Examining the impact of consumer heterogeneity on a consumer's media choice gives insight into the competition between media and substitutability across consumers by examining unobserved heterogeneity in baseline utility as well as in the satiation parameters. We include random coefficients for each baseline preference constant and include one common error component among all media options to generate heteroscedasticity and covariance in unobserved factors across activity types. This means that consumers may follow a common mechanism in evaluating media options relative to the outside good.</p><p>To achieve this, we need to partition the error term j into two independent components, j and j . The first component, j , is assumed to be independently and identically standard Gumbel distributed across alternatives. The second component, j , allows the estimation of distinct scale (variance) parameters for the error terms across alternatives to reflect the fact that a consumer may evaluate certain media options in a similar fashion. Let = 1 2 K and assume that is distributed multivariate normal, ∼ N 0 . We considered other specifications such as a common error component for all traditional media choices or alternative combinations of the media choices. However, the results were not significantly different.</p><p>Therefore, Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) can then be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P t * 2 t * 3 t * M 0 0 0 = M i=1 c i M i=1 1 c i M i=1 e V i + i K k=1 e V i + i M • M − 1 ! dF (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where F is the multivariate cumulative normal distribution. We extend Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>) to also include random coefficients on the independent variables z k and random coefficients in the k satiation parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data</head><p>In this section, we describe the data set, the extent to which media multiplexing occurs (and related switching, time effects, and consumer heterogeneity), and current industry practice for targeting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Media Consumption Data</head><p>The data are from the 2006 Universal McCann's Media in Minds Diary, spanning over 50 countries, including the United States. The survey highlights the multimedia pattern of adults and identifies when consumer segments best connect with old and new media forms; this study is the basis for the media plans for their global clients. The survey is continually adapted to reflect the changing landscape of all forms of communication and is the largest ongoing proprietary survey of its kind. Hence, it represents a generalizable sample of the population at large. Our sample consists of a panel of 1,775 individuals in the United States who reported their media activities-i.e., computer (or Internet), television, radio, or print (newspapers and magazines) by checking a box indicating whether they had consumed a particular media channel in a specified half-hour block over a seven-consecutive-day period. Media consumption represented approximately 40.7% of this time. This is consistent with recent research commissioned by Time Warner's Time Inc. that suggests that consumers in their 20s switch media venues as much as 27 times per nonworking hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Steinberg 2012)</ref>. We refer to nonmedia consumption activities as the outside option, and this is substantial, representing 40% of all switching from one time interval to the next.</p><p>We use a randomly chosen set of 1,500 individuals for estimation and a holdout sample of the remaining 275 respondents. For each respondent, we have demographic information, including age, gender, household income, household size, and location (i.e., urban or rural); and adoption of new media technologies such as home computer ownership (83.7%), workplace computer availability (44.7%), and cable television subscription (64.9%). Adoption for television sets and radio are virtually 100% and not included.</p><p>Respondents report their activities and attention levels for each media channel for seven consecutive days, except for the time periods from 1-3 a.m. and 3-5 a.m., which are each recorded as two individual observations. We aggregate the data to the one-hour level for more flexible modeling of continuous components. Over the course of the week, there are 22 × 7 = 154 time slots. The dependent variables are defined as the time spent on each media channel at each time slot, the total of which equals the time constraint. In the case of multiplexing, the total time will be treated as t = 60 minutes for each alternative chosen, because we do not observe the exact amount of time allocation to each media within the half-hour slot. Therefore, the complete data set contains 1 500 × 154 = 231 000 observations. Media multiplexing accounts for 8.7% of the observations (n = 19 994) and equivalently 21.4% of total media choices. A large share (40.2%) of this multiplexing occurs during the 7-9 a.m. and 7-9 p.m. time slots, prime advertising spots for television and radio. Whereas large segments engage in single-media consumption-i.e., computer (27.9%), radio (21.5%), and television (44.6%), nearly one out of five consumers in the sample are multiplexors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Media Channel Switching</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> displays the switching matrix for the average time movement across media. Each cell denotes the number and percentage share of occurrences of switching from the media channel in a row to the channel in the column in any consecutive time slot. For example, among those who used the computer in the past period, 18% remained with the computer channel in the next time period, whereas 8% switched to television, print, or an outside option and 7% switched to radio. In general, we observe that consumers are most likely to switch to television from radio (14%), print (16%), or an outside option (14%). The diagonal elements of these tables indicate the extent to which state dependence occurs; television exhibits the highest degree of state dependence (22%), followed by radio (21%), computer (18%), and print media (9%).</p><p>On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), 87% of the consumers in the sample are more likely to switch away from media to an outside option, whereas during the week (Monday-Friday), only 56% of consumers will switch. Although we do not observe noticeable differences in state dependence and intermedia switching between males and females, we do observe that younger audiences (aged 18-34) have more state dependence for computers (20%) than older audiences (aged 65-75, 12%) and are more likely to switch to this medium from television, radio, print, or an outside option (9.25% on average) than older audiences (5.25% on average). Collectively, the data set suggests that multiplexing is prevalent, and a model that examines switching, time-varying properties, consumer heterogeneity, and media-specific factors is necessary for understanding this phenomenon.</p><p>In the Web appendix (available at http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1287/mksc.1120.0759), we elaborate on these characteristics in further detail.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Model Covariates and Constants</head><p>We included several variables to obtain a rich understanding of consumers' baseline marginal utility with respect to media choice, media-specific satiation, and time-usage behavior. One direction for future research would be to add the media content being consumed so as to decompose the content in the baseline utilities. Covariates include (1) time-of-day dummies (12 a.m. is the base time slot), (2) day-of-week dummies (Saturday is the base day of week), (3) sociodemographics (household size, age, income, gender, location of residence, etc.), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) stated media attention level (where 1 = low, 2 = medium, and 3 = high attention), and (5) availability of media technologies: personal computer at home, computer at work, and cable television service. Together, these variables are stacked into the z ik parameter. We now contrast the results with an alternative demand specification-a single discrete/continuous demand model. This is our base specification, i.e., a <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hanemann (1984)</ref> model. This model has been further developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chiang (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mehta et al. (2010)</ref>. Specifically, we contrast results from the demand models using our parameterized form of the baseline marginal utility parameters, because this allows us to show the equivalence between models. For model selection, we examine both in-sample and out-of-sample statistical criteria.</p></div>

Interestingly, our model outperforms the benchmark model even when single media are consumed. The benchmark model predicts 50.8% for computer, 31.7% for television, 29.5% for radio, and 18.7% for print. In contrast, our single-media predictions are 99.1% for computer, 99.2% for television, 97.6% for radio, and 86.7% for print, underscoring the superiority of the proposed demand model from a goodness-offit standpoint. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, panel B, displays the proposed model performance for all possible media interrelationships. Thus, our main model produces excellent predictive ability for multiplexing choices that would not be captured by a simple single discrete/continuous demand framework. To summarize, our model leads to a hit rate of 97.0% compared with 60.3% from a Hanemann model.</p><p>Several aspects are worth noting. First, although this hit rate is higher than previous research-(e.g., around 80% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hansen et al. (2006)</ref>, 89% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mehta (2007)</ref>, 78% in Ainslie and Rossi (1998), 77% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chung and Rao (2003)</ref>, and 84%-94% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schweidel et al. (2011)</ref>-it more closely approximates the rate observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Manchanda et al. (1999)</ref> (i.e., 99%). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Manchanda et al. (1999)</ref> took a model-fitting approach, whereas our structural approach provides some theoretical insight while still robustly achieving similar hit rates. Second, we reran the prediction model across three subsamples of 5,000 randomly selected observations and observe consistently high hit rates (ranging from 95%-97%); more detail can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> of the Web appendix. Third, recall that 65% of the consumption choices involve an outside good, and these choices are accounted for, which might be driving up the hit rate to some extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.2.</head><p>Out-of-Sample Assessment. Two hundred and seventy-five individuals were held out and used for model validation; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, panels A and B. Again, the main model (95.9%) outperforms the benchmark models (60.1%) overall and for every possible single-media choice. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, panel B, displays the proposed model performance for all possible media interrelationships.</p><p>Let us now examine the baseline-preference constants and satiation-parameter estimates. In the interest of space, we do not examine or contrast the parameter estimates for the benchmark model directly (these are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> of the Web appendix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Robustness of the Time Period Specification</head><p>The data were collected in a half hour but could just as easily be aggregated to two-hour time periods (which is what we did between the hours of 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.). We estimated our model using half-hour time slots and observed that the parameter estimates are robust, both in direction and significance. For reason of space we did not include these estimates here; they are available from the authors upon request. Together, we conclude that our model is able to process and predict the continuous components of choice in a fairly flexible manner, more so than what is dictated by the data set structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Baseline-Preference Constants</head><p>The estimated baseline-preference constants and the corresponding t-statistics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. Any activity that does not involve consumption of any media is the base alternative. Because the outside alternative is considered more often than the inside alternatives, all the baseline-preference constants are negative. The baseline-preference constant for the print media option is more negative than other media, indicating the lower participation level of households in this media activity relative to the outside good. There are also significant baseline-utility differences across time of day and day of week and varying household and sociodemographic effects for each media. These specifics are of primary interest to media planners but, for reasons of space, are further described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> of the Web appendix. The Web appendix also contains additional details regarding unobserved heterogeneity in the baseline utilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Satiation Estimates</head><p>Recall that the role of k is to reduce the marginal utility with the increasing consumption of media k, hence its interpretation as a satiation parameter. The parameter estimates for our proposed model are displayed  Note. Alpha for the outside good is approximately 1 for all inside goods and 0 for the outside good. * * p &lt; 0 01; * * * p &lt; 0 001.</p><p>in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. High k values indicate low satiation. These parameters were introduced as a constant in our model specification for each media alternative. The satiation estimates and the corresponding t-statistics displayed in the last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> suggest that significant differences exist in the time-investment patterns for each media. The alpha estimates suggest that utility for the computer is nearly linear in time spent (0.999). However, utility for all old media formstelevision, radio, and print-have square-root diminishing returns to time spent (0.447-0.479). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide such evidence regarding media consumption at the individual (versus aggregate) level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Effects of Media Covariates and</head><p>Cross-Media Effects Fortunately, the data set contains information on media covariates such as attention and technology penetration. Not surprisingly, higher household attention for a focal media is associated with a higher level of utility forthe same media. Ceteris paribus, Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 310-324, © 2013 INFORMS holding the same attention level across media alternatives, the baseline utility for computer (7.740) is the highest relative to other media alternatives (2.089 for television, 2.212 for radio, and 3.599 for print). Whereas these attention levels would typically imply a 100% share of that media channel, by estimating the cross-media effects of attention on a media-specific baseline utility, we can infer whether attention levels enhance or weaken the utilities for alternative media. For example, although computer has the highest own-attention-level effect, the attention level for computer has a negative impact on the baseline utility for other media (e.g., −0.335 for television, −0.421 for radio, and −0.239 for print), suggesting that consumers who focus on computer media may be less likely to multiplex. In other words, for these consumers, non-computer media options might act as substitutes. In §6, we will examine the marginal rates of substitution to consider this possibility more rigorously. In contrast, consumers who have high levels of attention for television (2.089) are likely to multiplex print (0.104) but are unlikely to multiplex computer (−0.05) and radio (−0.095) media. Thus, for these consumers, utility for print and television is likely also increased.</p><p>Higher attention levels for all media alternatives negatively impact the baseline utility for computer, with the highest degradation from attention levels for print (−1.410). However, this substitution pattern is not found for the other three media alternatives. In fact, high attention levels for print media benefit the baseline utility for television (0.469) and radio (0.651). It is not uncommon for us to observe people reading newspapers while watching television or listening to radio. The allocation of attention suggests that consumer may intrinsically be attracted to multiple media channels, and the joint consumption is not necessarily as a result of satiation only.</p><p>We consider the role of media availability by examining media penetration in our sample. We acknowledge that this is a data-driven approach, and better data would be preferable. However, our approach is not inconsistent with the grocery choice literature <ref type="bibr">(Manchanda et al. 1999, Kim and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Allenby 2002)</ref>, which also does not examine shelf availability directly. Respondents who have subscribed to cable television service derive more negative baseline utilities for computer consumption (−0.063) but positive utilities for television (0.078), radio (0.004), and print media (0.07). In contrast, consumers who own a personal computer have higher utilities for computer media (0.043) and print media consumption (0.178) but negative utilities for television (−0.084) and radio (0.295). In other words, consumers with a computer at home are more likely to have higher utility for print media. In addition, if respondents use computers at work, then they experience more negative baseline utilities for all other media (e.g., −0.10 for television, −0.00 for radio, and −0.05 for print).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Media as Substitutes</head><p>The marginal rate of substitution for each media and cross-media alternative can give us insight into the nature of substitutability in joint media consumption. Specifically, it can enable the identification of which and what multiplexed options might be preferred to individual media options.</p><p>Recall from the discussions in §3 that k is the marginal utility at the point of zero consumption. It can be inferred by computing the marginal utility of consumption with respect to media k, which is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U t t k = k t k k + 1 k −1 (11)</formula><p>Alternatively, the marginal rate of substitution between any two media k and l at the point of zero consumption of both media is given by k / l . For two alternatives i and j, a higher baseline marginal utility for media i relative to media j implies that an individual will increase overall utility more by consuming media i rather than j at the point of no consumption of any media option. In other words, the consumer would be willing to give up media j in exchange for consuming more of media i. Thus, a higher baseline k implies a reduced likelihood of a corner solution for media k.</p><p>Using the recovered parameter estimates, we compute the own-and cross-marginal effects to examine individual media substitution patterns across the choice alternatives. These are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>, which uses only media-specific intercepts in the baseline utilities of each media alternative; this represents consumers' intrinsic preference for switching from a media option in the column to an alternative on the row from the point of zero consumption. Hence, on average, consumers would gain more utility from the television than from the computer (4.289), radio (3.126), or print (16.268). In contrast, print media Notes. The column represents the media option that will be SUBSTITUTED FOR, and the row represents the media option that will be SUBSTITUTED TO. These effects are computed using only the media-specific intercepts in the baseline utilities.</p><p>are easily substituted for all other media (0.061 for TV, 0.264 for computer, and 0.192 for radio). These rates of substitution can be further generalized to a specific day of the week and time of the day, or to a specific demographic. For example, for a certain group of media enthusiasts, the substitution patterns between joint consumption and single consumption would show the incremental benefits of multiplexing over individual media, revealing potential synergies. It is worth noting that this is the conventional approach to understanding such interdependencies in the context of the Bhat ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>) model. Further, if we consider the full range of marginal rate of substitution patterns at the point of zero consumption for multiplexed options with respect to the baseline constants, we might conclude that there is little willingness to give up single-media consumption for multiplexed options. This is evidenced in the first five columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> of the Web appendix. However, one of the virtues of our data set is that it also contains additional information on media consumption, such as individual attention for each media form for each time period as well as the household penetration. Thus, we can further unpack the nature of substitution among single and multiplexed media options. A high marginal rate of substitution of a multiplexing media option (for example, media AB) with a single-media option (A) suggests that consumers are willing to give up more single consumption of A for joint consumption with B.</p><p>Specifically, we find that consumers with high attention to the computer are less willing to give up this media type for all forms of alternative single and joint media combination, including any consumption choice that involves the computer. In other words, consumers with high attention for new media are unlikely to multiplex old media forms (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5A</ref>, column 2 of the Web appendix for detailed estimates). However, the reverse is not true; taking this same approach for each media form in turn, we find that those with high attention for old media are more prone to multiplex not only the consumption of new media such as the computer but also the consumption of all other forms of media (again, see the first five columns of Web Appendix Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5B-5D</ref>). Together, this suggests an interesting asymmetry in how prone consumers are to multiplex old and new media and gives insight into the nature of substitution patterns that exist in single versus multiplexed consumption.</p><p>In regard to computer penetration, we observe that individuals who own a computer are less likely to give up print media (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5E</ref>, column 5 in the Web appendix) and that such owners are educated, with higher household incomes. In contrast, consumers who have cable television at home would easily give up computer media consumption relative to all other forms of media (see the first two columns of Web Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5F</ref>). These cable subscribers tend to have lower household incomes and less education. Collectively, these results are consistent with the media landscape in 2006, the time frame of our sample. Computer penetration was likely to be lower, and online news was not as plentiful as it currently is, which might explain this stickiness for the computer for those who owned computers and the lack of stickiness for those with cable subscriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">A Model of Complementarity</head><p>Although the <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref> models are useful for better understanding the nature of substitution-i.e., whether a multiplexed option is preferred over a single-media option-it ignores complementarity between the choice options. We propose that the heart of the multiplexing phenomenon is the potential utility increase from joint consumption. We specify this mechanism as an interaction term among the media consumption options. This represents an important extension to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref>, which is primarily concerned with the main effects of choice options.</p><p>The closest research on complementarity in a multichoice context is <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee et al. (2011)</ref>. They propose a direct utility model for asymmetric complements in a two-good case of milk and cereal. They use a simplified log form specification, i.e., restricting to be 1 for all alternatives, to be 1 for all inside goods, and 0 for the outside option. However, we construct a more generalized direct utility model (i.e., with fewer restrictions and allowing for more choice alternatives). We allow for these possibilities via two-way interactions between all five media options. Note that our model can be applied and extended to solve for n-way complementarity, but we limit our analysis to twoway combinations for parsimony and interpretability concerns.</p><p>Specifically, the joint utility an individual consumer i derives from consuming time t over j = 1 5 media activities can be written as 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">U t = 5 j=1 j t j + j j + k =j j k t j t k + jk jk (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where t is a vector of dimension 5. The first summation part is identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref> and similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref>. The second part of the equation captures the additional utility gained from media multiplexing through interactive effects of the media options. Note that jk = j k would introduce a multiplicative random element to the baseline marginal utility of each media option if we were to use the same Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 310-324, © 2013 INFORMS parameterization as before, such that j = z j j = z j exp j . This could raise identification concerns that we address later in this section. The terms jk and jk reflect the differential satiation rates when consumers engage in media multiplexing as opposed to single-media consumption. Again, and are not separately identifiable, so we fix to be 1 for all goods in our empirical estimation. Higher values of are associated with more inertia of media consumption. The specific role of jk parameters in influencing the diminishing marginal returns is discussed and developed in detail in the paragraph below and graphed in Web Appendix 2. In short, jk represents the satiation effect of complementarity. If jk is greater than j + k , then consumers satiate less when multiplexing the two channels than consuming them independently.

In contrast, our interaction specification more explicitly specifies the nature of complementarity between the two media options; this is the essence of the phenomenon of integrated marketing communications.</p><p>The second cross derivative of the marginal utility shows the decreasing impact of complementarity: as t k increases, the impact of t k on the marginal utility of t j decreases as the complementarity effect satiates.

This approach does not allow the derivation of a random utility specification that is consistent with the additively separable stochastic specification of the baseline marginal utility in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">12</ref>).

This is because the model is difficult to "scale up"-i.e., to include all two-way, three-way, etc., interactions of j regressors. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Hence, we apply our model to a randomly selected subsample (i.e., 1/10 of the entire sample of n = 27 258), or 177 respondents.

Details are presented in the Web Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>.</p><p>The implication of our approach is that we will focus on the interpretation of baseline constants and satiation parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> displays the coefficients for the individual and joint satiation parameters, which guide the insights regarding cross-media synergies.</p><p>7.1.1. Radio Synergies. We observe such synergistic effects for radio when it is multiplexed with television or print. The individual satiation rates for television, radio, and print are 0.271, 0.100, and 0.111, respectively. However, when radio is multiplexed with television, the satiation rate is 0.477, and when radio is multiplexed with print, the satiation rate is 0.903, evidencing cross-channel synergy. This suggests that radio media managers could benefit from campaigns that pair their media form with television or print forms.</p><p>7.1.2. Print's Second Life. In 2008, of the $141.7 billion spent on advertising in the United States, Internet advertising grew by 7.3%, whereas traditional print media advertising declined by 19.7% over 2009 (Kantar Media 2010). This has led some pundits to suggest that perhaps print media ought to be eliminated altogether, because the Internet and television are collectively able to completely reproduce its content <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Isaacson 2009</ref>). However, our results suggest a very different story. We find that satiation for print is actually lowered when it is multiplexed with the computer (0.902), television (0.224), or radio (0.903), suggesting that the joint consumption of these media with Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 310-324, © 2013 INFORMS print is "stickier" than the consumption of print media (0.111) alone.</p><p>Whereas this bodes well for print media, the converse is not always true; consider the effects on the computer and television media. When these are multiplexed with print, the satiation parameter of each (Internet is 0.999 and television is 0.271) increases (compared to 0.902 for the Internet with print and 0.224 for television with print); this suggests that these media forms lose their stickiness when paired with print. Collectively, these results point to an intriguing irony: that print benefits when multiplexed with either old or new media forms but may undermine the stickiness of these individual alternatives. 7.1.3. The Internet and Old Media. A related concern regarding the elimination of print is the possibility that the Internet cannibalizes print media. We investigate this possibility by examining the satiation parameters for the joint consumption of the computer with any media form. We find that multiplexing the computer with any old media-i.e., television, radio, and print-lowers the satiation rate for each of these media forms-television is 0.496, radio is 0.311, and print is 0.902 versus 0.271, 0.100, and 0.111, respectively, for each medium individually. In other words, all old media forms benefit from being multiplexed with the Internet. This suggests a complementary versus a substitutionary role for new media, reviving and further enhancing the value of old media forms. This would suggest that the earlier statistic regarding increased multiplexing of television and tablets in 2012 leads consumers to consume more of both media than they would have in the absence of the other.</p><p>Conversely, we observe that old media heightens satiation of new media. In other words, although the multiplexing of television and the computer leads consumers to increase its consumption over the old media forms, the computer stickiness is degraded. This may also be because the data set reflects 2006 consumer habits, when multiplexing with the computer might have been less pervasive than today. Future research would be necessary to corroborate or disconfirm this finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Discussion</head><p>The goal of our research was to advance a model for predicting individual and multiplexed media choices while accounting for cross-channel synergies. The model performs well both in and out of sample and is robust to one-hour or half-hour time period specifications and differing metro areas. Although our model was developed at the individual consumer level, it can also be aggregated and cross-queried at the product category or industry level to generate specific insights for brands and product verticals.</p><p>Our estimates suggest that consumers spend less time consuming computer or radio media on the weekend and more time watching television and reading print media instead. Additionally, we reveal interesting (and often asymmetric) interdependencies across media channels via their marginal rates of substitution. Attention spans, media adoption, and individual differences also play a role. We find that the cross-media effect of attention on a mediaspecific baseline utility suggests interesting asymmetries across the media alternatives. For example, consumers with high attention for the computer are unlikely to multiplex traditional forms of media (radio, print, and television). In contrast, consumers with high attention for these traditional media options have higher utility for multiplexing all forms of media (including new and traditional). We also show that failure to account for media multiplexing can significantly reduce the reliability of the media planner's audience predictions.</p><p>To this end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> provides a robust model that is estimable on large data sets and can account for many independent variables, including media alternatives, heterogeneity, and time/day differences in helping to identify target segments. At a minimum, this enables IMC planners to better account for the media landscape when "targeting the minnows in the barrel." However, although this is a useful first step, a shortcoming of this model is its inability to give insights into potential complementarities and synergies that are at the heart of the multiplexing phenomenon. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim et al. (2002)</ref> model provides the basis for specification of these complementary possibilities and identification of which media forms benefit and which are undermined, underscoring the nature and direction of asymmetries in multiplexed consumption vis-à-vis an individual consumption scenario.</p><p>Given a multiplexing perspective, we can identify synergies among old media types. For example, we find that the joint consumption of radio with television or print satiates at a lower rate. In other words, multiplexing radio media can result in greater stickiness for multichannel consumption of traditional forms of media. Interestingly, we also find that the diminishing share of print media consumption can be revived if print is multiplexed with old or new media, suggesting a potential "second life" for this media form. Finally, we find evidence that all forms of old media benefit from multiplexing with new media-i.e., the computer. In other words, the multiplexed consumption of media results in a lower satiation rate for print, television, and radio forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Limitations</head><p>This research is limited in its ability to explain why consumers multiplex their media choices. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> model does not offer theory or a conceptual framework of what might account for these differences. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Luo et al. (2012)</ref> are able to use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bhat (2005)</ref> model to develop an explanation for how individuals allocate time across multiple leisure activities, because the composition of their data set better enable this.</p><p>From a methodological standpoint, we can identify a rank ordering among individual and joint consumption scenarios, but we cannot estimate the directional effects of each individual media on the other. In other words, although we can estimate the satiation of the joint effect of print and radio, we cannot isolate the effect of print on radio or radio on print. Fortunately, research in this vein is currently underway (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>And finally, the model of complementarity that we develop, although promising, remains a work in progress. Much is still to be done on its methodological development, such as scalability to higher-dimensional contexts and identification issues. As such, it is important that we temper our substantive conclusions regarding the intermedia synergies that we observed. In other words, these synergies are identified in the absence of media alternatives, heterogeneity, and time/day differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Implications for Management</head><p>Our research underscores the need for media planners to move away from single-media-focused choice models to the use of demand models that better incorporate and account for substitution and complementarities in multiplexing activities. Further, our study highlights the value of new individual-level (versus aggregated) media choice data. Market-level data can mask underlying consumer-and time-varying specific media choices and can limit our ability to identify media interdependencies. The demand model we introduce can be applied to other settings where consumers choose multiple alternatives and face some constraint that forces them to make appropriate tradeoffs in the consumption of these alternatives.</p><p>Our findings also point to the need for multimedia partnerships and identify potential candidates. As an example, radio advertisements should be coordinated with print and television media. Print media should be partnered with radio and Internet media forms. In other words, successful media management strategies in today's marketplace require a collaborative (versus a competitive) mind-set-i.e., instead of viewing each media form as a substitute for another, potential complementarities should be exploited via joint media campaigns and simultaneous multimedia exposures. This also underscores the need to move away from a competitive mind-set in media management (i.e., implied by a view of media consumption as being one at a time in sequence) to a multiplexed viewpoint in which consumers might serially "snack" on individual and simultaneous combinations of media forms. With this mind-set, the task of the media manager would be to empirically identify cross-channel media synergies and develop a strategy for its exploitation. Ultimately, we hope future research in this area will facilitate a better understanding of how firms can achieve higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness in their advertising resource-allocation efforts both within and across media.</p></div>
