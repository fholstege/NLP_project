<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The theory of rational choice assumes that the ratio of market shares between options does not depend on the presence or absence of other options. This principle, called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Luce 1959)</ref>, is essentially equivalent to the value maximization (VM) principle which is based on single scale (utility) value assumption (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tversky and Simonson 1993)</ref>. According to the single scalability assumption, the ratio of the choice probabilities of any two brands has a constant value as long as the utilities of the brands do not change. Let P X A denote the probability that alternative A will be chosen when set X is the set of available alternatives and u A the utility of alternative A. If we assume that there is another alternative A , with the same utility as A u A = u A , Luce's IIA axiom predicts that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P X A P X B = P Y A P Y B (1)</formula><p>for any choice set A B ∈ X, and A B ∈ Y . Does Equation (1) hold true even when the similarity between A and B is different from the similarity between A and B? Past studies, especially those based on parametric choice models, revealed that brandspecific utilities and interbrand similarities are the two most important dimensions in analyzing brand choice probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Luce 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">McFadden 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">McFadden , 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tversky 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tversky and Sattath 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batsell and Polking 1985)</ref>. This paper harmonizes previous findings on similarity, asymmetry, and dominance effects in consumer choice in the underlying eliminationby-tree (EBT) model allowing for similarity between alternatives. The results of this study show that if the similarity between A and B is greater than that between A and B (i.e., s A B &gt; s A B ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P X A P X B &lt; P Y A P Y B if u A = u A &gt; u B</formula><p>(2) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P X A P X B &gt; P Y A P Y B if u A = u A &lt; u B (3)</formula><p>The direction and the magnitude of the effect of differential similarities on choice probabilities differ depending on the relative preferences of the compared brands. This study refers to such an interaction effect of the relative preference and similarity on choice probability as the asymmetric similarity effect (or simply the asymmetric effect), because the more preferred brand will benefit when it is perceived as being similar to the less preferred brand. This study provides a clear mathematical formulation of the asymmetric effect which has been shown to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Debreu 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Tversky 1972</ref>, dominance effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huber and Sewall 1978)</ref> and IIA property <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Luce 1959)</ref>. This investigation will be based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tversky and Sattath's (1979)</ref> elimination-bytree model and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tversky's (1977)</ref> contrast model of similarity.</p><p>Asymmetric Effect in Binary Choice Cases I investigate how different levels of similarities between A and B affect P A /P B , or P A − P B , while the utilities of A and B remain constant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tversky (1977)</ref> expresses the similarity between alternatives as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Let's assume that there are only two alternatives A and B. Let be the total set of features (attributes) of alternative A, be that of B, and be the set of features both A and B have. According to the feature matching model (contrast model) of similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tversky 1977)</ref>, the similarity between A and B, s A B , is expressed as a function F of three arguments: (common features of A and B), − (the distinctive features of A) and − (the distinctive features of B).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s A B = F − − (4)</formula><p>If it is assumed that the values of and are fixed, both − and − become functions of . Thus, the similarity between A and B can be represented simply as a monotonic increasing function of .</p><p>Let u A and u B denote the overall utilities of A and B, respectively. I use , , and as representing the features as well as the utilities of the features as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tversky and Sattath's (1979)</ref> work. Thus, u A = , u B = .

The greater the value of , the more similar A and B are to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tversky 1977)</ref>. When = 0, A and B are completely dissimilar and share no common features. When A and B become as similar as possible = , encloses . In this case, the relative preference relationship becomes the dominance relationship as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (Case III).</p><p>According to the EBT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tversky and Sattath 1979)</ref>, the choice probabilities of A and B are</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P A = − + − 2 and P B = − + − 2 (5)</formula><p>Note that the notations used in this study are slightly different from those in <ref type="bibr">Tverksy and Sattath (1979)</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tversky (1972)</ref>. − and − (rather than single parameters) are used to represent distinctive features of A and B in order to incorporate the situation where the similarity values are different while the overall utilities of A and B, i.e., and are fixed. We assume that there are many different brands which have the same level of utilities but have differential similarities with a certain other brand as represented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The inter brands relationships in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> can be represented equivalently in twodimensional (attribute) space as in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huber et al. 1982)</ref>.</p><p>As represented by the iso-utility lines in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, it is assumed that u A = u A = u A = and u B = . Brand B is perceived to be more similar to Brand A than to Brand A. B is even dominated by A . One can intuitively infer that P A /P B would be greater than P A /P B (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huber et al. 1982)</ref>. In order to investigate the effect of the differential degree of similarity ( on P A /P B , I calculate the first and second derivatives of the choice ratio derived from the EBT model with respect to . Let's denote P A /P B as a function of , f . If one calculates the first and second derivative of f for the range 0 &lt; &lt; , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f = P A P B = − − (6)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">df d = − − 2 &gt; 0 (asymmetric effect) (7) d 2 f d 2 = 2 − − 3 &gt; 0 (8)</formula><p>The positive first and second derivative values imply that the share ratio P A /P B is a monotonic increasing, convex function of . The first derivative being positive (Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>) represents the asymmetric effect (type 1). The greater the similarity between A and B, the greater the advantage that the more preferred brand (Brand A) has over the less preferred brand (Brand B). It can be derived that lim There are many empirical studies manifesting the similar implications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carpenter and Nakamoto (1989)</ref> show that similarities between two brands ("me-too" and "pioneer") are likely to emphasize the advantages of the dominant brand (the pioneer). It is also shown that similarity along one attribute tends to enhance the difference on other attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tversky and Russo 1969)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chernev (1997)</ref> shows that the addition of common features (thus increased similarity) can (but not always) increase the likelihood of choosing the brand with the best value on the primary attribute, thus leading to a divergence of the choice shares of the alternatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kahn et al. (1987)</ref> have shown that it is advantageous for the more preferred brand to be paired with the less preferred similar brand, whereas the less preferred similar brand gets more damage from being paired with the preferred brand. This phenomenon has been called the asymmetric effect by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Glazer et al. (1991)</ref> and I adopt their terminology to refer to the similar phenomenon discussed in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">MacCrimmon (1973)</ref> points out that if a decision maker neglects to include in his choice set an option that would "dominate" a second option, the probability that the second option will be chosen is substantially increased. In summary, an external constraint that positions a strong brand (Brand A) close to a weaker, similar brand (Brand B) helps the strong brand and hurts the weak brand, making the value of P A /P B (or P A − P B greater. One can investigate the changes of P A and P B independently with a varying degree of .</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">dP A d = − + − 2 2 &gt; 0 d 2 P A d 2 = 4 − + − 2 3 &gt; 0 (9) dP B d = − + − 2 2 &lt; 0 d 2 P B d 2 = 4 − + − 2 3 &lt; 0 (10)</formula><p>The graphs of P A and P B in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> show that the increased similarity enhances the polarization of consumer preferences, leading to a divergence of relative shares.</p><p>If increases to , the maximum possible value of , Brand A dominates Brand B and takes all the share from B.

Complete overlapping of the features between options makes the option with even the slightest added feature dominate the other.

Also note that lim Asymmetric Effect and Other Non-IIA Choice Behaviors in a Three-Alternative Choice Set Case Let us assume a case where a third alternative, Brand C, is added to the two-alternative choice set A B . It will be shown that the asymmetric effect is a general phenomenon that occurs independent to irrelevant third options. I also show how the asymmetric effect is related to the similarity effect. Brand C is assumed to be dissimilar to both A and B (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). This case is equivalent to other cases where many irrelevant alternatives are added to the focal pair of brands. Let the utilities of the alternatives be u A = , u B = , and u C = ( &gt; and &gt; 0 . The similarity structure of the three alternatives can be represented by either a Venn diagram or a tree equivalently.</p><p>Based on the EBT model, the probabilities of choosing A, B, and C from the choice set A B C can be calculated as follows.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d = − − 2 &gt; 0 (15) d 2 f d 2 = 2 − − 3 &gt; 0 (16)</formula><p>It can also be derived that df /d &gt; 0, where f = P A − P B (proof omitted).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Conclusion</head><p>The asymmetric effect is a very important market phenomenon which has been empirically validated. The asymmetric effect can explain many marketing phenomena but has not been given enough explicit attention. The asymmetric effect can directly lead to the attraction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huber et al. 1982)</ref> if the lone alternative effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahn et al. 1987</ref>) is assumed to exist. However, the present study is based on the theory of rational choice. Thus, choice behaviors considered to belong to the realm of the regularity violation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huber et al. 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Simonson 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Gourville and Soman 2005</ref>, or to the no choice option effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dhar 1997, Dhar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Simonson 2003)</ref> are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>The asymmetric effect is in fact a very general phenomenon that can be derived from many different perspectives of modeling consumers' choice behaviors, such as random utility maximization models (Appendix II). The asymmetric effect can be directly derived from many choice models based on random utility theory (RUT) incorporating the similarity effect (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">McFadden 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Currim 1982</ref>. However, in either the random or non-random utility approaches of choice modeling, the asymmetric effect has not been explicitly mentioned nor has it received separate attention. This study provides an explicit formulation of the asymmetric effect and an integrative summary of the asymmetric effect, similarity effect, dominance effect, and IIA condition. The mathematical formulation presented in this study does not give completely new practical implications but does make it possible to develop an integrative and exhaustive mathematical summary of all possible implications of parametric choice models. It is noteworthy that the economictheory-based summary of choice behaviors presented in this study may not have significant meaning in the context of reason-based choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Simonson 1989)</ref> or semiparametric choice modeling approaches (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cui and Curry 2005)</ref> where there is no assumption of a particular model structure.</p><p>The asymmetric effect can be applied in firms' marketing practices effectively and trigger further academic research as well. Interbrand similarity often determines which brand is considered as a reference brand in the focal brand's evaluation. The focal brand's market share is affected by which competing brand is compared to it <ref type="bibr">Leclerc 1998, Dholakia and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Simonson 2005)</ref>. Due to the loss aversion effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kahneman and Tversky 1979)</ref>, direct comparison makes the comparative disadvantage receive greater weight than the comparative advantages. If we assume that the greater similarity between two alternatives (ex, alternatives being in the same product category) implies the greater likelihood of their direct comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Leclerc et al. 2005)</ref>, previous studies on comparison effect lead to the same conclusion as the asymmetric effect; increased similarity causing more damage to the less preferred alternative whereas favoring the preferred alternative. Thus, it would be interesting to explore the conceptual and mathematical relationship between the EBT/EBA models and the prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kahneman and Tversky 1979</ref>) from the perspective that the level of similarity can play a critical role in determination of a referent.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Similarity Relationships in a Binary Choice Case</figDesc></figure>

If we assume that var A = var B (McFadden 1978), as approaches 1, AB approaches 0. Thus, lim →1 AB = 0, lim →1 P A = 1, and lim →1 P B = 0 (dominance effect). The random utility counterpart of the EBT model would be the nested logit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Domencich and McFadden 1975)</ref> and the generalized extreme value model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(McFadden 1978)</ref>. The analysis of these randomutility-based models provides the same results as the EBT model.</p></div>			</div>
