<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Latent attrition models lie at the heart of transactional (i.e., noncontractual) customer base analysis, because customer attrition is not observed and hence must be inferred <ref type="bibr">(Kumar and Reinartz 2006, p. 103)</ref>. These models can be used to forecast future purchasing for both new and existing customers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schmittlein et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Fader et al. 2010</ref>) and aid managers in areas such as customer valuation, customer targeting, and resource allocation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kumar 2000, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Early models ignored covariates entirely (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schmittlein et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Fader et al. 2005a</ref>), yet more recent research has incorporated time-invariant predictors like demographics that covary with purchasing and attrition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abe 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Neslin et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Singh et al. 2009</ref>. Though these models represent an important advance, the next step is to consider the effects of time-varying marketing efforts, a necessary tool for managing customer relationships and evaluating the financial impact of marketing. The key challenge in estimating the impact of such marketing activity is carefully adjusting for how it is targeted.</p><p>In addition to omitting marketing, latent attrition models often assume that the time in between transactions and the transaction sizes are independent (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Peterson 1994, Fader et al. 2005b)</ref> or are conditionally independent within customers over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borle et al. 2008)</ref>. We relax these assumptions by linking the intertransaction times and transaction amounts in two distinct ways. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borle et al. (2008)</ref>, we account for the crosssectional relationship between intertransaction times and transaction amounts, e.g., customers who make frequent purchases may spend more. We also link the intertransaction time process and the transaction amount process at the individual level (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jen et al. 2009</ref>) so that, for example, customers may compensate for a longer-than-expected intertransaction time by spending more than the average. In sum, we account for correlated transaction timing and spending within and across customers.</p><p>After incorporating marketing and relaxing the independence assumption, we demonstrate that our modeling framework provides superior guidance to managers allocating marketing resources across customers. The key feature of the model is that it 472 Marketing Science 32(3), pp. <ref type="bibr">471-487, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> probabilistically classifies donors as active or inactive based on the sequence of past transactional activity and responsiveness to marketing. Distinguishing between inactive customers who will not respond to a firm's marketing and active customers who are responsive to marketing is critical for ensuring that the firm is not wasting resources by sending marketing to inactive customers. We next review two streams of literature relevant to our research and to which we contribute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Marketing Response Models</head><p>Marketing response models relate customer purchase incidence and/or quantity decisions to marketing or detailing efforts, and they capture dynamics by allowing past events (marketing and response variables) to affect current response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manchanda et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Donkers et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Van Diepen et al. 2009</ref>. Though these models provide useful estimates of the incremental value of direct marketing, they ignore the phenomenon of latent attrition, which is "of prime importance" in noncontractual businesses <ref type="bibr">(Blattberg et al. 2008, p. 121)</ref>. Prior research has considered the role of marketing efforts in contexts where the end of the relationship is observed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Reinartz et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Schweidel et al. 2008b</ref>, but our focus is on marketing's impact when attrition is unobserved and must be inferred, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been considered previously.</p><p>In this research, we contribute to both market response models and latent attrition models by allowing direct marketing activity to affect (1) an individual's transaction rate while he or she is active, (2) the size of the transaction, and (3) the length of the individual's latent relationship with the firm. Direct marketing may benefit the firm if it reduces attrition and consequently extends a customer's latent lifetime. However, it may adversely affect the firm if such efforts irritate customers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fournier et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Venkatesan and Kumar 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Van Diepen et al. 2009</ref>) and lead them to become inactive more quickly. We offer a comprehensive view of direct marketing by distinguishing the "short-term" effects on an individual's transaction rate and size from the "longterm" impact on an individual's latent lifetime (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Montoya et al. 2010)</ref>, and we demonstrate how the overall impact of direct marketing hinges on the balance of these effects. If direct marketing increases the transaction rate and the latent lifetime, it will drive up the total number of transactions unequivocally. If direct marketing diminishes the latent lifetime but increases the transaction rate, the change in the total number of transactions depends on the relative magnitude of each effect. Whether such a trade-off exists is critical for organizations, as their direct marketing may be front-loading transactions into the early part of the relationship and exacerbating attrition rather than generating incremental transactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Nonrandom Marketing Activity</head><p>The very nature of direct marketing is one of the reasons that it has been a challenge to incorporate its effect into latent attrition models. By design, direct marketing activity is nonrandom and targeted at specific individuals at specific times. Ignoring this will lead to biased estimates of the effectiveness of direct marketing. Hence, in the model, we account for two ways in which direct marketing efforts may be nonrandom. First, marketers may target select customers with direct marketing activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manchanda et al. 2004)</ref>. Though these targeting decisions may be partially driven by observable summaries of customer behavior such as the recency and frequency of transactions, other factors such as expert judgment that are unobservable to the researcher may also drive this decision (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. 2006)</ref>. Managers may also time their direct marketing opportunistically to coincide with local events, greater-than-average website visits, or other unobserved time-varying factors. These unobserved shocks can affect both the firm's likelihood of sending direct marketing and the customer's likelihood of responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gupta and Park 2012)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to account for these two possibilities in a latent attrition framework.</p><p>In sum, we propose a model that allows direct marketing to influence customer transactional behavior through three distinct mechanisms, we account for the nonrandom nature of direct marketing activity, and we allow for associations between transaction timing and spending. Using scenario analysis, we demonstrate how our model can quantify the bottom-line impact of direct marketing activity over time. We also demonstrate how it can identify those individuals who are most likely to conduct transactions in the future. In doing so, we also illustrate an important caveat about the usefulness of P (Alive), a popular measure derived from latent attrition models that has been incorporated into several decisionmaking frameworks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kumar 2000, Venkatesan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kumar 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We first describe the data used in our analysis, and next develop our model. We then present our empirical findings and demonstrate how the model can quantify the impact of direct marketing and identify individuals likely to donate in the future. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the current research and avenues for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>Our donation and mailing data come from a nonprofit organization in the United States and were made  Subsequent to each donor's first contribution, we model repeat donation behavior on a monthly basis, because the organization sends its direct marketing at the start of each month. 2 Donors made, on average, 1.54 repeat donations and spent $38.69 on each donation. Similar to many applications, the distribution of donations across donors is skewed: 50% of donors make no repeat donations, 17% make a single repeat donation, and 10% make two repeat donations. Among donors making at least one repeat donation, donors made, on average, 3.07 repeat donations. The average total donation level per month is $6,094, and the average amount per donor making a contribution is $37.97.</p><p>We use the data on donations and direct marketing to motivate several aspects of our model and 1 As our data are from a nonprofit organization, we use the terms "donor" and "organization" in place of "customer" and "firm," respectively. In discussing the organization's direct marketing activity, we use the terms "mailing" and "direct marketing" interchangeably. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Although we analyze the data at the monthly level, corresponding with the frequency of the organization's direct marketing efforts, our analysis could be applied at a more granular (e.g., daily or weekly) or coarse (e.g., quarterly or annually) level.</p><p>provide model-free evidence that is consistent with latent attrition. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the repeat donation activity of a cohort of donors who made their first contributions in January 2002.</p><p>Consistent with latent attrition, we see that both the number of donations and total donation amounts decline over time. A similar pattern emerges among donors in other cohorts. Examining the time since donors in our sample made their last contribution to the organization, we observe an increasing pattern over time: in January 2003, the average number of months elapsed since a donor's last donation was 8.68 months; in January 2004, it was 15.98 months; and in January 2005, it was 23.77 months. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> also shows seasonal peaks in donations activity in November, December, and January.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the sample proportion receiving a mailing each month subsequent to their first donation to the organization. Early in our observation period, most donors appear to receive a mailing every other month, with the exception of the winter, in which the organization appears to send mailings more frequently. Moreover, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows that there is variation over time with direct marketing activity declining in later months, consistent with an organization curbing its efforts in response to donors who have likely become inactive.</p><p>The most noticeable shift in direct marketing activity occurs at the beginning of 2005. With the exception of a single peak in mailing activity that occurs in July 2005, less than half of the donors in our sample receive mailings each month during 2005 and 2006. Ninety-eight percent of donors received mailings in January 2004, yet only 42% received them in January 2005. Among those who donated within one  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model Development</head><p>We begin by developing a joint model of the time between donations and donation amount for an active donor. Next, we incorporate latent attrition by allowing for the possibility that donors can become inactive permanently. Finally, we model the organization and use observed donor history, unobserved donor characteristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. 2006)</ref>, and temporal shocks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gupta and Park 2012)</ref> to drive its mailing decisions. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> provides a general schematic of the model and the order of decisions made by the organization and donor.</p></div>

We include both a linear and quadratic effect of direct marketing activity to allow for the possibility of wearout at high levels of direct marketing. Conditional on donor i making a donation in month t, we assume that the donation amount A it follows a lognormal distribution with parameters it and :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">it = 0 + 1 • Winter t + 2 • DM it + 3 • DM 2 it log A it ∼ N it 2 (5)</formula><p>We denote the corresponding c.d.f. of the amount model as G a and the probability density function (p.d.f.) as g a .</p><p>We use a bivariate Gaussian copula <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Danaher and Smith 2011)</ref> to correlate the marginal distribution of interdonation times and donation amounts to account for compensating behavior. For example, if the correlation is positive, an individual will donate a largerthan-expected amount after a larger-than-expected interdonation time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jen et al. 2009</ref>). Let t * = −1 F t z it and a * = −1 G A it , where −1 x is the probit function. We assume that (t * a * ) follow a standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation . If (X Y ) are distributed according to a standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation , the conditional distribution for X given Y = y is a normal distribution with mean • y and variance 1 − 2 . Thus, conditional on the value A it = a, t * follows a normal distribution with mean • −1 G a and variance 1 − 2 . Substituting the c.d.f. of the log-normal distribution for G a and simplifying, the conditional distribution of t * can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">t * a ∼ N • log a − it 1 − 2 (6)</formula><p>The cumulative distribution associated with the conditional distribution of F t z it A it ) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F t z it A it = −1 F t z it − • log A it − it / 1 − 2 (7)</formula><p>When = 0 and the interdonation timing and donation amount processes are independent, F t z it A it in Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is given by F t z it .

First, because we model the time since the last donation, we can account for compensating donor behavior mentioned earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jen et al. (2009)</ref> demonstrate that ignoring this behavioral phenomenon leads to poorer predictive performance and customer overvaluation in two different empirical settings. Second, our timing model accounts for the path over time (within the interdonation time interval) of direct marketing; the timing of the donation may depend on the stock of direct marketing at the time of donation as well as the stock of direct marketing faced in the months since the last donation <ref type="bibr">(Franses and Paap 2001, p. 158)</ref>. Thus the expected donation amounts conditional on a donation occurring are a function of both the amount of time that has elapsed since the last donation and past direct marketing activity, as these two factors impact F t z it .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Incorporating Latent Attrition in Donation Behavior</head><p>The model outlined in Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) accounts for active donor behavior. At some point in time that is unobserved by the firm, donors may become inactive. Hence the attrition process is latent and must Marketing Science 32(3), pp. 471-487, © 2013 INFORMS be inferred from prior activity. To allow for the possibility that donor i becomes inactive after the tth month, we assume that the time-varying probability that donor i remains active is given by q it :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">q it = 0 + 1 • Winter + 2 • DM it + 3 • DM 2 it (9)</formula><p>If q it = q i , resulting from 1 = 2 = 3 = 0, then donor i's latent lifetime follows a geometric distribution, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fader et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Let A i• be a vector of length T that contains the amount donated in each month of the observation period by donor i. As a latent attrition model is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with two states (active and inactive), the likelihood associated with donor i's sequence of activities can be written as follows (MacDonald and Zucchini 1997):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L A i• = Ã i1 Q i1Ãi2 Q i2 • • • Q i T −1ÃiT 1<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where = [1 0] denotes the initial distribution in which all donors are assumed to begin in the active state, 1 is a 2 × 1 vector of ones, the matrix Q it is the transition matrix given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Q it = q it 1 − q it 0 1 (11)</formula><p>such that the inactive state is assumed to be an absorbing state, and the matrixÃ it is a diagonal matrix of the likelihoods conditional on being in each state of the hidden Markov model at time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">A it = h t A it z it 0 0 I A it = 0 (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Donor i can be in the inactive state at time t only if we observe no donations. Hence the likelihood conditional on donor i being in the inactive state at time t is captured by the indicator function I A it = 0), which has a value equal to 1 if A it = 0 and is equal to 0 otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Identification</head><p>As with extant latent attrition models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schmittlein et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Fader et al. 2005a</ref>), our model probabilistically classifies donors as active or inactive based on the sequence of past transactional activity. To provide some intuition for how our model is identified, let us consider two scenarios. For a frequent donor with short interdonation times, when many months have elapsed since his last contribution, it is unlikely that such an interval would occur if the donor were still active. In contrast, an infrequent donor will have long observed interdonation times. In this situation, a longer interval would need to pass without a donation occurring for it to be inconsistent with his previously observed interdonation intervals. For both of these individuals, as more time elapses without a transaction, it becomes increasingly likely that they are inactive. The estimate of whether a donor is active or inactive, however, is probabilistic and represents the uncertainty of the inference. The likelihood that an infrequent donor is inactive may be close to 0.5, representing maximum uncertainty, whereas for the frequent donor, it may be closer to 0.9 or 0.1. Latent attrition models assign a probability to whether an unobservable change point (active versus inactive) has occurred based on prior observed transactional activity and the length of the censored intertransaction time. Such changes in behavior are identified similarly in more general HMMs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Netzer et al. 2008</ref>, of which latent attrition models can be considered a subset. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In addition to the standard latent attrition model arguments, responsiveness to direct marketing is another source of information that helps us identify whether a donor is currently active. If direct marketing increases the likelihood that a donor conducts a transaction and a donor has received a high volume of direct marketing, he is more likely to conduct a transaction, assuming he is still active. As such, if he has not conducted a transaction after receiving a high volume of direct marketing, it is more likely that he is inactive.</p></div>

Hence the total impact will depend on whether the short-and long-term effects complement each other (e.g., increase both the likelihood of donation incidence and the time horizon) or oppose each other (e.g., increase the incidence of donations while shortening the time horizon). In the latter case, an organization must balance the short-term benefits of direct marketing against the long-term consequences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Montoya et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Accounting for the Organization's</head><p>Mailing Process and Heterogeneity In addition to modeling the individual's donation behavior, we also must account for the organization's nonrandom targeting of direct marketing activity. Consistent with the industry and extant literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gönül and Shi 1998)</ref>, we model the organization's decision to send marketing to a donor in a given month as a function of donor history, as captured by recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) variables and a seasonality variable, because the organization's mailing efforts are higher during the winter months (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We assume that the decision to send donor i a mailing in month t (Direct it ) occurs if u it + it &gt; 0, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">u it = 0 + 1 • Recency it + 2 • Frequency it + 3 • Monetary it + 4 • Winter t (15)</formula><p>If we assume that it follows a standard normal distribution, this results in a binary probit model. The values for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary at each point in time are calculated based on donor i's donation history prior to month t. We operationalize Recency as the number of months that have elapsed since the last donation, Frequency as the number of donations made to date, and Monetary as the logarithm of the average amount that has been donated.</p><p>In addition to donation history, we expect the organization may base its decision on unobserved donor characteristics such as giving capacity or wealth. Such unobserved heterogeneity may also be related to differences in donation behavior and marketing responsiveness. We establish an association between donation and mailing processes by using a latentclass framework in which the parameters governing the donation process and the organization's direct marketing decisions are class specific (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Schweidel et al. 2008a</ref>. For example, one class of donors may have a higher frequency of giving and be less likely to become inactive compared with others, and the organization may be more likely to send direct marketing to this group. The latent-class model induces an association among the parameters governing the frequency of transactions, amount of transactions, and latent attrition, akin to Abe's ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) assumption that the model parameters are correlated. Moreover, this approach is similar to models that link marketing decisions to individuallevel response parameters through specific parametric models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Manchanda et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Van Diepen et al. 2009</ref>. As in such models, we jointly model a given individual's decision conditional on marketing activity and the organization's marketing activity toward the given individual.</p><p>In addition to the cross-sectional donor targeting as described above, the organization may take advantage of special events, such as a spike in website visits, by timing its marketing to coincide with them. These unobserved, time-varying events represent a common shock that affects both the donation decision and the direct marketing decision (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gupta and Park 2012)</ref>. To account for this possibility, we link the organization's direct marketing decision to an individual's donation behavior. Rather than linking the organization's direct marketing activity to the individual model components (the time until the next donation, the amount donated conditional on a donation occurring, and the latent lifetime), we establish a relationship between the mailing decision and the distribution of donation amounts at time t, D it a z it , which synthesizes the individual model components. Using the posterior probability of a donor being active (Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">13</ref>)), D it a z it is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">D it a z it = P it Alive 1 − F t z it 1 − F t − 1 z it + 1 − P it Alive + I a &gt; 0 P it Alive • 2 log a − it −1 F t z it − 2 log a − it −1 F t − 1 z it • 1 − F t − 1 z it −1 (16)</formula><p>where 2 x y is the standard bivariate normal c.d.f. evaluated at (x y) with correlation . The first two terms of Equation ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), as in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">14</ref>), account for the probability that a donation does not occur and hence yield a probability mass at a = 0. The remaining terms "turn on" for donation amounts a &gt; 0, which may only occur if donor i is still active at time t, and the donation occurs at time t given that it has not occurred by t − 1. When = 0, the term in curly braces simplifies to the probability of a donation at time t conditional on it not having occurred by t − 1, multiplied by the normal c.d.f.</p><p>Having derived the cumulative distribution of donation amount, we use a Gaussian copula to link it to direct marketing. Letting d * = −1 D it a z it , we assume that (d * ) follow a standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation . If &gt; 0, individuals who are prone to make a larger-than-expected contribution at time t are also more likely to receive a mailing at time t. Having derived the model for donors' behavior at time t with the likelihood L A it , we now construct the joint likelihood of the decision to send direct marketing to donor i at time t (Direct it ) and i's donation decision at time t A it , denoted J (A it Direct it ). Recall that the organization sends a mailing to donor i in month t if m it + &gt; 0. If a donation occurs (A it &gt; 0), then is normally distributed with mean</p><p>• d * it and variance 1 − 2 . The marginal probability with which a donation does not occur (A it = 0) is given by D it 0 z it and d * it = −1 D it 0 z it . The joint probability of donor i receiving direct marketing and not making a donation, conditional on a donation not occurring, can be expressed as the quotient of 2 d * it m it to D it 0 z it . The joint likelihood of donor i's donation decision at time t and the organization's decision to mail to that donor can then be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">J A it Direct it =                                        L A it × 2 d * it m it D it 0 z it Direct it • 1− 2 d * it m it D it 0 z it 1−Direct it if A it = 0 L A it × m it + •d * it √ 1− 2 Direct it • 1− m it + •d * it √ 1− 2 1−Direct it if A it &gt; 0</formula><p>(17) If the vector denotes the size of each latent class, the log likelihood for the set of donation decisions made by donor i and the organization's direct marketing activity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">LL A i• Direct i• = log S s=1 s T t=1 J s A it Direct it (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>It is worth pointing out now how our context and model differ from several recent direct marketing response models. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van Diepen et al. (2009)</ref>, response observability is endogenous because individuals must respond to a particular mailing in their empirical setting.</p><p>In contrast, we observe individuals making donations months after they have received direct marketing. Hence we develop a timing model of monthly donation decision, taking into account the time that has elapsed since the last donation in a manner consistent with prior literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fader et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>Because our model accounts for the impact of current and prior direct marketing efforts on donation occurrence and amount, it is generalizable to other direct marketing contexts.</p><p>In addition to differences in the empirical context, our methodological approaches also differ. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van Diepen et al. (2009)</ref>, we incorporate latent attrition to allow donors to become permanently inactive. 6 By allowing direct marketing to impact the donation decision while a donor is active and the likelihood of that donor becoming inactive, our model can quantify the increase in revenue due to direct marketing activity. Our methodological approach also offers a means of accounting for common shocks that may simultaneously affect direct marketing and donation decisions, as well as allowing the direct marketing process to vary across donors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Analysis</head><p>We calibrate a series of nested models using maximum likelihood estimation with up to three latent classes. We find that the predictive performance does not improve after two classes and that our substantive findings remain unchanged. We therefore conduct our model comparisons using the model with two latent classes. First, we estimate a model in which we do not take into account the role of time-varying covariates (No covariates). Second, we estimate a model in which we assume that the direct marketing decisions are independent of the donation decisions (Independent direct marketing). Under this specification, we assume that the vector is the same across the two latent classes and that = 0. We then allow direct marketing decisions and the donation decisions to be linked by assuming that is specific to the latent class, though we still assume that = 0 (Linked direct marketing). Finally, we estimate our full model in which we relax the assumption that = 0 (Common shock). In addition to these nested models based on the latent attrition framework, we estimate a Type II Tobit model similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. (2006)</ref> with two latent classes and RFM variables as predictors both in the organization's mailing decision and in the donor's behavior (RFM model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Model Results</head><p>We compare model performance during the calibration period using the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) for each of the model specifications. To assess the predictive ability of the modeling framework, we conduct 10,000 simulations of expected donor activity during the validation period and average across the simulations. We calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) for the aggregate monthly donations during the validation period, averaged across months, and the RMSE on the amount contributed by each individual in each month of the validation period to assess individual-level forecasting performance. We present these model fit statistics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><p>There are larger differences in model performance based on aggregate RMSE than individual RMSE, because most observations have no donations at the individual monthly level. The model that performs best out of sample at the individual and aggregate levels during the holdout period is the Linked direct marketing model, a nested version of the Common shock model that is based on the latent attrition framework. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The latter model performs better in the calibration sample but worse in the validation sample. The RFM model has the lowest BIC of all models during the calibration period; but good in-sample fit, often at the expense of holdout fit (as seen in the RMSE of aggregate monthly donations), is a wellknown concern with RFM models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Malthouse 1999</ref>). Hence we focus on the Linked direct marketing <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We do not observe substantive differences in the effects of direct marketing activity between these two model specifications. The correlation coefficient = 0 04 (S.E. = 0 01) suggests a small association between the mailing process and expected donation amount. As this model has poorer predictive ability than the nested Linked direct marketing model, we focus the remainder of our discussion on results under the more parsimonious specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4</head><p>Monthly Donation Amount During the Holdout Period To better gauge model fit, we plot the total amount size donated each month (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and the number of monthly donations made during the holdout period (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows that our model forecasts reflect the general pattern of donations, though it underpredicts donations in months 4 and 8.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that we capture the general pattern in donation incidence, though we underpredict in month 8. Including additional predictors, such as monthly differences rather than a single Winter variable, may provide the model with additional flexibility to capture this spike in behavior.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> suggests that it is not necessary to account for the way in which direct marketing is targeted if the only objective is to forecast future donation activity. However, our key focus and an issue of managerial importance is evaluating the impact of direct marketing. This requires not only incorporating direct marketing activity in the model of donation behavior but also accounting for the way in which the decision to send direct marketing may be linked to donation behavior. Beyond yielding marginally improved forecasts, as we will show, our analysis offers a new perspective on the impact of direct marketing by considering its effect on latent attrition.</p><p>To ensure the estimation procedure can recover the model parameters accurately, including those related to the latent attrition process, we conduct a simulation study. We simulated 100 data sets using parameters estimated from our empirical application. Each data set contained 4,000 donors observed over 40 months, similar to our calibration sample. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The results show that the true parameters (on which the simulated data are based) are within the 95% interval of the parameter estimates from the simulated data sets, indicating that we are able to recover the model parameters. Although the maximum likelihood procedure generates bias, our simulation results suggest this is low. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> To test the stability of our latent classes, we also conducted cross-sample validation by estimating the model on a second sample of the same size from the donor base. The key substantive findings from this analysis were similar to those resulting from our analysis of the calibration sample, providing further support for our results.</p><p>Next, we examine the parameters governing donation behavior. The decay rate for direct marketing is = 0 68 (S.E. = 0 01). We present the parameters <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The simulated data sets match key features of our data, including the distribution of donations across donors, the proportion of periods with no observed donations. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We calculate the bias and RMSE for each parameter in the model. The bias of our estimates ranged from −0.062 to 2.52, with an average of 0.084; the RMSE ranged from 2 34 × 10 −4 to 2.88, with an average of 0.331.  (and standard errors) specific to each latent class in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The parameters governing the incidence of donation when the donor is active show that class 2 has a higher baseline probability of making a donation ( 0 ) compared with class 1. For both classes, there is approximately the same propensity to donate in winter months ( 0 + 1 ), and direct marketing activity increases the probability with which donations occur ( 2 ), which increases at higher levels of DM ( 3 ).</p><p>Whereas donors in class 1 have a lower baseline tendency to make donations compared with those in class 2, they tend to donate larger amounts ( 0 ). Additionally, we find a positive correlation between the interdonation time process and the donation amount process ( ). This is consistent with compensating behavior, with donors giving larger amounts when more time has elapsed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jen et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The key differences between the two latent classes are in the attrition process. The donors in class 2 have a higher baseline tendency to remain active ( 0 ) compared with those in class 1. The segments differ in how they respond to direct marketing. In both latent classes, we find 2 &lt; 0 and 3 &gt; 0, suggesting a U-shaped relationship between DM and the likelihood with which an individual remains active. As such, depending on the value of DM, direct marketing may adversely affect the likelihood of donors remaining active and making contributions in the future. Examining the range of DM observed in our data (min DM = 0; max DM = 3 16), we find that for class 1, low levels of DM have a slight negative impact on the latent lifetime, whereas higher levels of DM increase the latent lifetime. Thus, direct marketing increases the latent time horizon over which donations occur for those donors in class 1 at sufficiently high levels. Alternatively, for those donors in class 2, the observed values of DM are contained in the downward portion of the U. Consequently, the horizon over which a customer in class 2 makes donations diminishes with DM. We illustrate the effect of DM on −1 q it in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>The impact of direct marketing on donation amounts ( 2 and 3 ) follows a U shape for individuals in class 1; although there is a slight negative effect for low levels of DM, the effect is positive and increases for larger values of DM. In class 2, direct marketing has a slight negative effect on donation amount.</p><p>In sum, donors in class 1 positively react to higher levels of direct marketing with long latent lifetimes, increased donation incidence, and donation amounts; for donors in class 2, direct marketing increases donation incidence (for active donors), yet it shortens the latent lifetime and diminishes donation amounts. One explanation for these findings is that direct marketing temporally compresses donation activity. That is, rather than a given number of donations occuring over a given latent lifetime, direct marketing activity may increase the frequency of donations but shorten the time period over which they occur. The net effect of these opposing forces would determine whether the total amount an individual donates remains the same, increases, or decreases. Our results for donors in class 2 regarding the effect of marketing on donation incidence and latent attrition are consistent with this, but the negative effect on donation amounts is not necessarily so. Alternatively, it may be that direct marketing contributes to irritation, consistent with the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van Diepen et al. (2009)</ref> that donation amounts diminish with increased direct marketing. Although the authors also find that donation incidence diminishes with increased direct marketing, their analysis did not incorporate latent attrition. We believe that our results are consistent with the view that high levels of direct marketing contribute to irritation, which affects donation behavior (both incidence and amount) while a donor is active and reduces the likelihood of remaining active, which can reduce donation incidence in the long run.</p><p>The negative impact of direct marketing on the tendency to remain active has important consequences for the organization. For donors in the larger latent class (class 1), direct marketing has a positive impact on the tendency to make donations while active. When there is a sufficient stock of DM, direct marketing has a positive impact on the amount donated and the latent length of the relationship. Thus, on all three of these dimensions, direct marketing has a positive impact on donation behavior. In the smaller latent class (class 2), direct marketing has a positive impact on the tendency to donate while active but a negative impact on the length of the relationship and donation amount. Whether the organization should continue to send direct marketing to this class depends on whether the upside potential from increasing the likelihood of a donation among active donors outweighs the risks associated with increasing the chances that a donor becomes inactive. We investigate this issue shortly.</p><p>Turning to the mailing process, again we observe important differences across the two latent classes. The intercepts for the latent classes ( 0 ) reveal a higher baseline rate of sending direct marketing to class 1 compared with class 2. This is consistent with donors in class 1 reacting positively to direct marketing; donors in class 2 exhibit mixed reactions to direct marketing. As expected, direct marketing activity declines as more time elapses since the last donation ( 2 ). This decline occurs more rapidly in class 1 than in class 2, which is consistent with the organization implementing different direct marketing plans for its donors. As donors in class 2 are less likely to become inactive, the organization may continue to market to them for a longer period of time following their last donation. We also find that the organization is more likely to send direct marketing to donors in class 2 who have a higher frequency of past repeat donations ( 3 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Managerial Application: Valuing</head><p>Direct Marketing Efforts By quantifying the value of direct marketing efforts, we can illustrate the managerial applicability of our Marketing Science 32(3), pp. 471-487, © 2013 INFORMS model and, more specifically, investigate whether the increase in donations for active donors in class 2 outweighs the risks of driving active donors to defect. Based on an individual's posterior probability of class membership as of the end of the calibration period, we simulate latent-class membership and whether the donor is still active at the beginning of the forecasting period. For those donors who are still active, we simulate their donation behavior during the forecasting period. We repeat this simulation procedure 1,000 times and average the donation behavior across the simulations.</p><p>As a baseline scenario, we first conduct our simulation procedure assuming that no direct marketing is sent during the forecasting period. We then simulate donation behavior by incorporating the organization's observed direct marketing activity through the first t months of the forecasting period. Taking the difference between the scenario that employs the direct marketing activity through month t of the forecasting period and the scenario that omits direct marketing provides a measure of the cumulative increase in donation activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schweidel et al. 2011). 12</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we present the cumulative effects of direct marketing during the first t months of the forecasting period on the amount donated during the forecasting period, averaged across all donors and simulations. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> reveals a general increase in the overall cumulative impact of direct marketing (solid black line), suggesting that marketing activity is increasing donation activity, with an average increase of $7.26 across all donors compared with the scenario in which they receive no direct marketing.</p><p>In interpreting Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we note two important caveats. First, the rate at which the cumulative impact of direct marketing increases is related to the organization's observed marketing activity. This is, in part, to ensure that we are not simulating too far out of the range of normal policy. Here, the organization sends more direct marketing during the winter months, which may contribute to a faster increase. Second, though we observe what appear to be diminishing returns to direct marketing toward the end of the holdout period, we note that it may be attributable to there being few remaining months in the 16-month time horizon in which direct marketing may impact donation behavior. A mailing sent in the first month of the holdout period may impact behavior throughout the entire 16-month period, whereas a mailing <ref type="bibr">12</ref> One could also construct measures of the incremental effect of direct marketing by comparing the scenario with direct marketing through month t with the scenario with direct marketing through month t − 1 (e.g., Braun and Schweidel 2011). sent in the final month may only impact donation activity in that month. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> also presents the cumulative impact of direct marketing for the donors most likely to be in each of the two latent classes. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> The increasing cumulative effect of direct marketing pattern holds in both latent classes; the expected increase is $11.05 for class 2 donors (28%) and $5.79 for class 1 donors (72%). At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive, given that direct marketing has a negative impact on the latent lifetime of class 2. However, because the baseline tendency to remain active ( 0 ) is high for class 2, direct marketing's impact on the donation behavior of active donors outweighs the risks of driving active customers to defect.</p><p>The above analysis, though, ignores differences in the organization's direct marketing efforts across individuals. Consistent with the difference in recency of donations across classes at the start of the validation period (31.0 months for class 1 donors versus 12.4 months for class 2 donors) and the difference in P (Alive) at the end of the calibration period (0.20 for class 1 donors versus 0.80 for class 2 donors), <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Should the organization have a direct marketing schedule it intends to employ over a longer time horizon, the same approach could be employed to gauge marketing's impact over that time frame. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We assign customers to the latent class for which they have the highest posterior class membership in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, but our simulation procedure does not "hard code" these assignments. For each of the 1,000 simulations conducted, donors are assigned to the latent class probabilistically based on the posterior probability of class membership.</p><p>class 1 donors receive fewer mailings than donors from class 2 (2.84 mailings versus 9.18 mailings). Comparing the expected increase in holdout donations per mailing, mailings to class 1 donors generate an average increase of $2.04 per mailing (5.79/2.84), whereas mailings to class 2 donors generate an average increase of $1.20 per mailing (11.05/9.18). Contributing to this difference is the higher baseline donation amount for donors in class 1 compared with class 2. Thus, despite the longer average recency and lower average P (Alive) for donors believed to be in class 1, it would be premature for the organization to write off these donors.</p><p>To further investigate the overall impact of marketing in the presence of latent attrition for the two latent classes, we simulated 100 data sets, each one comprising donation activity and direct marketing received for 4,000 donors observed over 40 periods, using the estimated model parameters as before. We compared average total repeat donations observed in this scenario to one in which no direct marketing is sent. Repeat donations increased by 0.55 in class 1 and 1.97 in class 2 when direct marketing was included. We can compare these results to those when the latent attrition component of the model is "turned off" to quantify its impact. When latent attrition is omitted, direct marketing increases repeat donations by 1.23 in class 1 and 2.47 in class 2, revealing the extent to which latent attrition diminishes the impact of direct marketing in both latent classes. Note that whereas the impact of direct marketing on latent lifetime is negative in class 2, the overall impact on donation behavior is positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Managerial Application: Identifying</head><p>Likely Donors In addition to valuing the impact of direct marketing activity, identifying the prospects most likely to conduct future transactions is a common problem faced by managers. To demonstrate how our modeling framework can provide guidance in this task, we derive two different metrics that could be used to rank individuals in terms of how likely they are to make a donation during the forecasting period. First, we calculated the probability that a donor is still active (i.e., P (Alive)) at the end of the calibration period, a metric that has been proposed in much extant customer relationship management research as a means of scoring customers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reinartz and Kumar 2003)</ref>. However, although P (Alive) captures the likelihood that an individual is active at a particular point in time and hence has the potential to donate in the future, it does not take into account the forecasting timeframe. A more appropriate measure we derive is the probability that an individual donates at least once during the forecasting period ("incidence probability"). This measure considers the direct marketing activity in which the organization engages during the forecasting period, as well as the tendency to conduct transactions while active.</p><p>We first construct deciles of customers based on their score on each of these metrics and compute the proportion of customers in each decile who make a donation during the forecasting period. This is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</p><p>As expected, we find that a smaller proportion of donors in "lower" deciles make contributions during the forecasting period. Moreover, we find a stark difference between the two metrics in their respective top deciles. Whereas approximately 60% of the donors with the highest P (Alive) scores make a contribution during the forecasting period, approximately 90% of donors with the highest incidence probabilities make a contribution. Donors with high values of P (Alive) are expected to still be active and hence able to make a contribution at some point in the future, but high values of P (Alive) do not ensure that this will happen during a specific time horizon. In contrast, the incidence probability takes this into account.</p><p>We can also use the deciles analysis above to calculate the economic value of our model. A fullblown individual-level optimization of direct marketing based on the model is beyond the scope of the paper. Instead, we provide an illustration of how our modeling approach could be employed, following the exercise in <ref type="bibr">Blattberg et al. (2008, p. 279)</ref>. We sort donors into deciles from most likely to least likely to donate in the forecasting period according to the incidence probability. We assume that the organization decides whether to send direct marketing to donors in a given decile based on decile-specific profitability; if they send marketing, they do so according to the estimated parameters of the mailing model. For each decile, we calculate a predicted profit based on the decile-specific predicted average response rate, decile-specific predicted donation amount, and decilespecific predicted average number of direct mailings received. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The predicted profit per donor targeted is $13.50; with no model-based targeting, the predicted profit per average donor is $6.44. In the absence of such marketing activity, the predicted profit per average donor is $2.41. Hence the economic value of direct marketing and using the model to target direct marketing efforts is considerable.</p><p>To further explore our modeling framework's ability to identify likely donors, we consider two additional measures that are not based on the latent attrition framework: the predicted probability with which donors make donations during the holdout period under the RFM model and a heuristic that ranks customers first in terms of their recency and then in terms of their frequency. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>, we present the proportion of donors making a donation, as ranked by each of the four methods described above. As a point of reference, we include a 45 line. If the proposed metric classifies donors well, we should find that the curve lies above the 45 line, suggesting that the measure more accurately identifies those individuals who make donations during the forecasting period than one would select by chance. We see that all four of the proposed methods of ranking donors are better able to distinguish likely donors better than chance.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows that the incidence probability measure dominates the other three measures until the proportion of donors reaches 0.5, at which point it is tied with the RFM model. Overall, this indicates that the incidence model scores likely donors best compared to P (Alive), the recency heuristic or the RFM model. To the best of our knowledge, the comparison between using the incidence probability and P (Alive) to score customers has not previously been conducted in the literature employing latent attrition models and it is of managerial relevance. Although P (Alive) is a popular metric, it does not take into account the likelihood that a transaction will occur within a specific time frame. In our empirical application, it performs no better than the recency heuristic. If such forecasts are desired, calculating the probability of the event occuring (while accounting for the likelihood that the individual is still active) may offer more accurate forecasts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Models that incorporate latent attrition ignore the role of marketing, whereas marketing response models have omitted the phenomenon of latent attrition. Our model aims to fill this gap by incorporating timevarying covariates into a latent attrition framework; it allows marketing to affect the rate at which individuals make contributions, the amount of the contributions, and the length of the latent lifetime over which they make contributions. It also accounts for within-donor correlation between interdonation times and donation amounts, as well as the nonrandom nature-both at a cross-sectional level and at a timevarying level-of the organization's mailings. Though we find that direct marketing increases the donation rate, our analysis reveals that high levels of direct marketing can adversely affect the latent lifetime for some.</p><p>By accounting for direct marketing's impact on three dimensions that comprise transactional activity (latent lifetime, transaction frequency, and transaction amount), we demonstrate how our model can quantify the financial impact of direct marketing over a specified time horizon; this can provide guidance as far as mail scheduling. Organizations may then weigh the cost of their marketing efforts against the expected gains, as well as assess on which individuals to focus their efforts. As our empirical application shows, such analysis may reveal that it is still worthwhile to send direct marketing to individuals who have not donated in quite some time, as the amount they donate may be larger if they are spurred to action. In addition, we demonstrate how our model can be employed to identify the most likely donors, yielding more accurate forecasts compared to alternative metrics.</p><p>There are a number of directions in which the current research can be extended. First, although we establish a link between donation behavior and direct marketing to account for both cross-sectional targeting and common shocks, alternative methods of linking customers' and organizational behavior could be examined. For example, a structural model that incorporates latent attrition may allow for the evaluation of alternative direct marketing schedules. Second, though our data do not include information on the message content, our framework could be used to examine which message is most effective for which individuals, enabling the organization to tailor its activities based on an individual's response to past marketing efforts. For example, the degree of overlap in content among messages may moderate the effects on incidence, quantity, and lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blattberg et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Future research may consider the short-term and long-term effects of marketing activity in contexts where customers conduct repeat purchases. In such settings, customers' utilities from later consumption experiences may systematically differ from their early consumption experiences and the effects of marketing may differ across these stages (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Danaher et al. 2001, Schweidel and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fader 2009)</ref>. Generalizing our latent attrition framework by incorporating additional active states into the HMM may offer a path toward investigating such phenomenon. Research should also examine the role of other forms of marketing, such as coupling direct marketing efforts with electronic communications, personal contact with development officers, mass marketing, and social media strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Trusov 2011, Moe and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schweidel 2012</ref>). Though some tactics may reduce the time between transactions, other forms may influence the duration of an individual's latent relationship. Such a nuanced understanding is key not only in estimating customer value but also in estimating the effectiveness of marketing actions so that resources may be allocated appropriately based on both the impact and cost of different marketing decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Alternative Specification for Direct Marketing Stock Variable</head><p>In a field experiment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Simester (2004)</ref> found evidence of a postpromotion dip for customers who received a special promotional catalog, suggesting purchase acceleration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Neslin et al. 1985)</ref>. To allow for such a pattern, we consider a model specification in which our stock variable DM reflects the amount of direct marketing activity received since donor i's most recent donation; that is, the stock variable "resets" following a contribution, which would capture the empirical pattern of a postpromotion dip. This is similar to the implementation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Moe and Fader (2004)</ref> in which the effect of prior website visits accumulates until a customer makes a purchase, at which point it resets to zero. Under this model specification, we assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">DM it = Direct it + • DM i t−1 • I A i t−1 = 0 (A1)</formula><p>where A it is the amount donated by individual i at time t. If a donation were to occur at t − 1, the stock variable DM it would be equal to 1 if direct marketing is received at time t (Direct it = 1) and 0 otherwise. In contrast, if A i t−1 = 0, then DM it comprises the sum of direct marketing activity at time t (Direct it and the decayed prior stock ( • DM i t−1 ). We provide a stylized illustration of how the DM stock variable evolves under Equation (A1) in whereas that described in Equation (A1) assumes that the stock is "spent" on a transaction and then begins again at 0, which gives rise to the postpromotion dip and accelerated transactional behavior.</p><p>Recall that direct marketing may also affect the latent attrition process. If DM positively affects donation incidence when a donor is active and also increases the likelihood of latent attrition, we may observe that donation activity is temporally compressed into a shorter latent lifetime. This is distinct from the mechanism that gives rise to the postpromotion dip that is commonly associated with accelerated transactional behavior. We may find that data are or are not consistent with the postpromotion dip while a donor remains active; we may also find data that do or do not suggest that DM increases the likelihood of latent attrition. We therefore consider it an empirical question as to whether the direct marketing stock variable DM resets following a transaction.</p><p>To test this, we estimated the model that assumes DM resets, and it was found to yield poorer performance during both the calibration and forecasting periods. This suggests that the observed data are more consistent with a model in which the DM stock variable does not reset following a transaction. As such, we do not find evidence to suggest a postdonation dip characteristic of accelerated activity while donors are active. We therefore present result under the model specification in which DM accumulates across donations, as presented in Equation (4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B. Economic Value of the Model</head><p>To evaluate the economic value, we use the decile cutoff approach of <ref type="bibr">Blattberg et al. (2008, p. 279)</ref> to select customers to target with direct marketing. We assume that the organization mails (using the estimated mailing model) to all customers in a given decile if the predicted profit is positive. We calculate predicted profit per customer for a given decile d as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">d = a d m − r d f − cn d (B1)</formula><p>On the revenue side, a is the expected donation amount (taking into account both the likelihood of donation incidence and the expected donation amount when a donation incidence occurs), and m is the contribution margin (which we assume is 0.90). In terms of the costs incurred by the organization, r is the predicted response rate to direct marketing activity, f is the fulfillment cost (which we assume is $1.00), c is the contact cost (which we assume is $1.00), and n is the number of mailings sent. All predictions are based on model forecasts for the validation sample period, months 41-56; for the purposes of this exercise, we assume that this is one period by aggregating across months. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">B</ref>.1 shows that only the top five deciles have positive predicted profits. The average predicted profit per donor targeted is $13.50. If the organization randomly targeted its donors instead of using the model, the average predicted profit per donor is $6.44. If no mailings are sent, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">B</ref>.1, this yields an expected profit of $2.41 per donor. Hence the economic value of using the model to target donors raises predicted profits considerably.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Observed Donation Behavior for January 2002 Cohort</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">In Appendix A, we consider an alternative specification for the direct marketing stock variable DM that allows for a postdonation dip in the likelihood of a donation occurring. This model specification yielded poorer predictive performance using both aggregate and individual-level error measures.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Though we condition on the donation amount A it in Equations (6)-(8), we do not assume that A it is decided prior to the decision to make a donation. We construct the model in this manner to derive the joint distribution of donation incidence and amount by employing the known conditional distribution of a bivariate normal distribution.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">To ensure that our modeling approach is consistent with the data, in the next section, we test the predictive ability of our latent attrition model against a model similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donkers et al. (2006)</ref> that does not incorporate latent attrition.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">For the purposes of comparison, we estimated the linked direct marketing model with three latent classes. Whereas insample fit improves with the addition of model parameters (log likelihood = −115 572; BIC = 231 647), predictive performance does not improve (aggregate monthly donation RMSE = $2,173; individual monthly donation RMSE = $22.46). Given no improvement in forecasting ability, we present the results of the more parsimonious model.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">Small perturbations to the model parameters can yield larger changes in the log likelihood, given the number of observations in our data. This results in small standard errors for the parameter estimates.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="15">We assume a contribution margin of 90%, a fulfillment cost of $1, and a mailing (contact) cost of $1 per direct mailing sent. The details are in Appendix B.16  We also considered a heuristic in which donors were ranked first in terms of frequency of donation and then by recency. This did not differ substantially from the heuristic we present in Figure9.</note>
