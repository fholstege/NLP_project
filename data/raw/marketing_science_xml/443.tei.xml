<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Factors affecting the adoption of new products have long been of great interest to marketers. Social interactions between consumers are of particular interest because they may result in social spillovers, in which a marketing action that affects one agent then indirectly influences other agents. Marketers often attempt to account for these social spillovers when determining the targeting and intensity of marketing activity. However, there must be a causal social interaction effect for the social spillovers to exist. In the classic aggregate diffusion models, such as the canonical <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bass (1969)</ref> model, social contagion is assumed to be a driving force behind accelerating adoption rates, but the estimated coefficient of contagion may capture a variety of factors that influence the diffusion of the technology, which may or may not include social interaction effects. This paper makes several contributions to the literature on social interaction effects in the adoption of new technologies. Substantively, we document and estimate the magnitude of peer effects in the diffusion of an environmentally beneficial technology, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Policy makers are particularly interested in the diffusion of solar PV technology as increased adoption leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Methodologically, we provide an empirical approach for the quick and straightforward estimation of peer effects using daily adoption data. Our methodology leverages the difference between the date an installation is requested and completed along with a first-differences estimation method to (i) avoid the restrictive functional and distributional assumptions on the data-generating process and unobservables often seen in the literature, (ii) control for endogenous group formation and correlated unobservables with a rich set of fixed effects, and (iii) avoid the biases present in traditional fixed effects estimation with endogenous or predetermined regressors. Although a first-differences methodology is far from new, our estimation approach to deal with the endogeneity of predetermined regressors is novel.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2 we discuss the difficulties of identifying causal peer effects using traditional methods in the literature and lay out our approach for addressing them. In §3, we provide background on the industry, describe the data, and document the pattern of geographic clustering of solar PV panels in California. In §4, we present our results and evidence suggestive of different possible mechanisms behind the peer effect. We provide further evidence of causal peer effects using Bollinger and Gillingham: Peer Effects in the Diffusion of Solar Photovoltaic Panels</p><p>Marketing Science 31(6), pp. 900-912, © 2012 INFORMS 901 quasi-experimental variation in §5. Section 6 compares our results to those obtained using other diffusion models. Section 7 concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Identification of Peer Effects</head><p>2.1. Perils in Identifying Peer Effects Causal peer effects are notoriously difficult to identify. To begin, there are three well-known issues that often confound the identification of peer effects: endogenous group formation leading to self-selection of peers (homophily), correlated unobservables, and simultaneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Manski 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Brock and Durlaf 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Moffitt 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Soetevent 2006</ref>. Consider a setting where agent i in peer group z i is making some choice (e.g., what technology to adopt) at the same time as others in the peer group. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Then the three issues can be easily seen in the common linear-in-means model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a it = + Ɛ a z i t + Ɛ x z i t + u it (1)</formula><p>where a it is the choice by agent i at time t, Ɛ a z i t is the average number of adoptions in i's peer group z i at time t, Ɛ x z i t is a vector of average characteristics in z i at time t, and u it is a stochastic error term. Although is intended to capture the effect of the actions of others in z i on the decision of agent i, it will not be consistently estimated if Ɛ u it z i x = 0. This is the case if there is self-selection of peers on common (unobserved) characteristics or if there are any other correlated unobservables, such as macroeconomic trends or time-varying localized marketing efforts. In addition, may not be identified if the decision maker is influencing others while also being influenced by them, a simultaneity issue known as reflection. By taking the mean of (1) conditional on z i and t and rearranging, we can see why simultaneity implies that is not identified in this model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ɛ a z i t = 1 − + 1 − Ɛ x z i t</formula><p>One can consistently estimate the combined effect / 1 − , but it is not possible to separately estimate the causal social interaction effect . Randomized field experiments are one way to address this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertrand et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Sacerdote 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Duflo and Saez 2003</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hartmann et al. (2008)</ref> discuss many of the strategies often used with nonexperimental data. One common approach used to address the self-selection of peers and correlated unobservables is to include a rich set of random or fixed effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Manchanda et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Nair et al. 2010</ref>. In this case, (1) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">a it = + Ɛ a z i t + Ɛ x z i t + z i t + u it (2)</formula><p>where z i t are random or fixed effects for the peer group and time. If peer group effects flexibly control for group-specific characteristics, and if self-selection is the only issue, then Ɛ u it z i x = 0 and can be consistently estimated. Correlated unobservables can also be addressed with a rich enough set of random or fixed effects; if the correlated unobservables are timevarying, as in the case of targeted unobserved marketing, then peer group-time effects would be necessary.</p><p>There are several approaches that can be used to address the simultaneity issue. In some cases, detailed data on the peer group provide an exclusion restriction when there are only partially overlapping peer groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De Giorgi et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Nair et al. 2010</ref>. However, a more common approach is to have the agent's decision depend on past decisions made by agents in the peer group. A common way to implement this approach is to include the "installed base" of the product or service purchased in the relevant peer group as the explanatory variable of interest and condition x on the previous time period:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a it = + b z i t + Ɛ x z i t − 1 + z i t + u it (3)</formula><p>where the installed base is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">b z i t = t−1 =1 m z i j=1 a j</formula><p>where m z i is the number of potential adopters in z i . In this context a j is an indicator for an affirmative decision.</p><p>The installed base has been used extensively in the marketing literature in the early aggregate diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bass 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mahajan et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mahajan et al. , 1995</ref> and in more recent studies using disaggregate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sorensen 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Choi et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Iyengar et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Narayanan and Nair 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, McShane et al. 2012</ref>. Unfortunately, there remain further challenges to using the installed base as the regressor of interest in the presence of random effects or fixed effects. The issue here relates closely to the dynamic panel data literature, which describes how models with fixed effects and random effects are inconsistently estimated when a lagged dependent variable is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nerlove 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Nickell 1981</ref> definition, b zt contains lagged adoptions, so the inclusion of random effects or fixed effects will lead to inconsistent estimates, just as in the dynamic panel data literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manchanda et al. (2008)</ref> work around this by including only the past adoptions of others in the group, implicitly assuming that the errors are not correlated for individuals within the same peer group. Random effects have a further issue: the installed base is the aggregation of previous adoption decisions of other consumers who share the same random effect, so the random effects and installed base are by construction correlated. Thus the random effects and installed base are not orthogonal, so random effects estimation is inconsistent. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Narayanan and Nair ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) study the diffusion of hybrid vehicles and address this issue with the installed base using two approaches: an instrumental variables approach and a bias correction approach using fixed effects. Both hold promise in certain settings. When suitable instruments are available, an instrumental variables approach is quick and easy. In practice, suitable instruments tend to be extremely difficult to find, particularly because the installed base is a stock variable. The bias correction approach uses the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) errors to find a closed-form solution for the bias as a function of the variance of the errors and the variance of installed base. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Unfortunately, the bias adjustment is only appropriate when there is no autocorrelation in the errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Our Methodology</head><p>Our methodology addresses the issues inherent in identifying social interactions and provides a consistent estimate of the effect of the installed base of solar PV panels on the household-level decision of whether or not to install them, even in the presence of correlated unobservables. We leverage the fact that in the solar PV market, the decision to install solar panels does not lead to an instantaneous installation, as a result of the time needed to complete the necessary paperwork and perform the installation. Other situations in which there may be a time lag between the decision to adopt and the actual adoption include purchases of new vehicles, all online A model with random effects is inconsistently estimated if i is correlated with y it−1 , yet this is the case by construction. A meandifferencing approach to fixed effects, y it −ȳ it = y it−1 −ȳ it−1 + it −¯ it , is inconsistently estimated since it −¯ it is correlated with y it−1 −ȳ it−1 . A similar issue occurs using a first-differencing approach for fixed effects estimation. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Maximum likelihood estimation with random effects can be consistent if the true distribution of the errors is known and specified correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Narayanan and Nair 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The bias is found to be plim N → ˆ − = 5/9 2 / 2 b , where 2 is the variance of and 2 b is the variance of b.</p><p>purchases, customized product purchases, and the adoption of regulated or incentivized products. In our situation, we would not expect social interactions to have an effect until the solar PV panels have actually been installed, after which point the adopter would have experienced the benefits of the panels and neighbors may then be able to see the installation. Accordingly, we define the installed base in our setting as the cumulative number of completed installations at time t in zip code z. We drop the i subscript because we perform the analysis at the zip code level, and all households in a zip code have the same peer group: the other households in that zip code. Letã zt be an indicator variable for a completed installation (i.e., delivery of the product or service). Then b zt = t =1 m z j=1ãj . In our primary specification, we model the probability that a household in zip code z adopts a solar panel in any given day t as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Y zt = + b zt + X zt + zq + t + zt (4)</formula><p>where Y zt is the fraction of owner-occupied households in z that had not previously adopted solar panels and decide to adopt on day t; zq are zip code-quarter fixed effects (q denotes a quarter); t are time indicator variables, including year-month indicators, day of the month indicators, and day of the week indicators; and zt is a mean-zero stochastic error. X zt contains additional explanatory variables that may vary over time, such as indicator variables for different levels of subsidies available for adopting solar panels.</p><p>We estimate (4) using several approaches, including traditional fixed effects estimation taking meandifferences on the zip code-quarter, zip-quarter random effects, and our preferred specification that uses first differences to consistently estimate , even with the predetermined b zt and serial correlation. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The first-differences specification is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Y zt − Y zt−1 = b zt − b zt−1 + X zt − X zt−1 + t − t−1 + zt − zt−1 (5)</formula><p>The following proposition formally describes when is consistently estimated in the first-differences model. Let l denote the time lag between the adoption decision and the installation of the solar PV panel, and let denote the order of autocorrelation of . Proposition 1. If (i) l &gt; + 1 and (ii) the social interaction effects do not begin until the installation has been completed, then in (5) is consistently estimated. See Appendix A for a proof. We could further relax assumption (ii), because the consistency of holds as long as the order of autocorrelation is less than the number of days after the decision to adopt before social interactions take effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Industry Background and Descriptive Evidence</head><p>In January 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) established the California Solar Initiative (CSI), a $3.3-billion, 10-year rebate program aiming to "install 3,000 megawatts (MW) of new solar over the next decade and to transform the market for solar energy by reducing the cost of solar" (CPUC 2009, p. 1). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> These substantial subsidies have contributed to the dramatic growth in annual solar PV adoptions in California over the past decade. To explore the pattern and determinants of this growth, we assembled an installation-level data set of residential solar PV installations in the three investorowned utility (IOU) regions from January 2001 to December 2011. The data include the zip code of the customer, IOU, size of the installation and incentive, PV installer and manufacturer, the date when the customer requested solar incentives for an installation, the date payment was submitted for the installation, and the date of completion. We further augment the installation data with zip code-level demographic data from Sourcebook America and American FactFinder, as well as data on hybrid vehicle registrations from R. L. Polk &amp; Co. The cleaned data set includes 85,046 requested residential installations between January 2001 and December 2011. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> contains zip code-level summary statistics for residential installations and key demographics.</p><p>If there are indeed peer effects in the diffusion of residential PV panels, we would expect to see a spatial clustering of installations. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a) shows the initial pattern of clustering of solar PV panel installations in the San Francisco Bay Area from 2001 to 2003. More densely populated zip codes tend to have more installations, yet there are densely populated zip codes with few installations and less densely populated ones with many installations. This could be indicative of either peer effects or spatially correlated preferences, perhaps due to the clustered environmental preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kahn and Vaughn 2009)</ref>. Moreover, we find a similar clustering pattern at the neighborhood level.</p><p>The presence of peer effects should also imply accelerating adoption in regions with more installations. 1,500-3,000 3,000-5,000 5,000-7,500 7,500-10,000 10,000-15,000 15,000-20,000 20,000-30,000</p><p>30,000-60,000 0-500 500-1,500 1,500-3,000 3,000-5,000 5,000-7,500 7,500-10,000 10,000-15,000 15,000-20,000 20,000-30,000</p><p>30,000-60,000</p><p>Indeed, in our data the pattern of clustering appears to build on itself. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> provides summary statistics for the probability of a household adoption in a zip code-day and the zip code installed base. To better understand the distribution of each of these, Figures <ref type="figure">3  and 4</ref> provide histograms for the probability of  adoption (conditional on there being an adoption in the zip code on that day) and the installed base. Not surprisingly, in 98% of the observations, there are no adoptions in the zip code that day.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents our primary zip code-level results.</p><p>The first column contains the ordinary least squares (OLS) results from estimating (4) without zip code fixed effects, the second column contains the results using the traditional mean-differenced zip-quarter fixed effect (FE), the third column contains zip-quarter random effects (REs), and the fourth column presents the first-differenced (FD) results from estimating (5). Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Narayanan and Nair (2012)</ref>, the traditional mean-differenced results appear to be biased downward. Using a Hausman test, we find that we can reject the orthogonality assumption of the random effects model at a 90% confidence level. In the traditional fixed effects regression, we find statistically significant and positive (albeit small) autocorrelation for the first two lags (days), whereas in the first-differences regression, we find a statistically significant, negative correlation of −0.5 for the first lag (a mechanical result of the first-differencing). This demonstrates that the order of autocorrelation is much less than the time between the adoption decision and the installation, which had a median of 163 days and is greater than 40 days 99% of the time. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The actual installation time (from breaking ground to completion) is short, with a median of 11 days and an average of 16 days. So even if the social interaction effect began once the actual installation began, our estimation method is valid because the decision to install occurs so much earlier.</p><p>Our preferred coefficient estimate of 1.567 is statistically significant at the 1% confidence level and implies that every additional installation increases the probability of a household adoption in the same zip code by 1 567 × 10 −6 . At the average number of <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The mean is 195 days with a standard deviation of 121. owner-occupied homes in a zip code of 4,959, an extra installation in the zip code increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points.</p><p>At the average number of installations in a zip code of 13.1 and the average household adoption rate of 4 390 × 10 −6 , the installed base elasticity of adoption is 4.68. At the median installed base of 2 (in zip codes with at least one adoption), the elasticity is 0.71. These results provide clear evidence of a statistically and economically significant effect. 8</p><p>4.1.1. Testing for a Time-Varying Response. As a robustness check, we estimate a model allowing for the response to new installations to change along with the level of the installed base. We find a small, positive, and statistically significant effect of an included quadratic term, implying increasing effects of new installations. In another specification we interact the installed base and year. Figure 5 plots these coefficients 9 with robust standard errors, again indicating that the installed base effect increases over time. Such an increase may derive from recent marketing efforts to leverage peer effects to induce adoptions. For example, one of the strategies employed by SolarCity (the largest installer in California) involves finding one or two vocal solar advocates in a neighborhood and giving the entire neighborhood a slightly lower price if enough adoptions are made within that neighborhood. Some firms commonly increase the visibility of new installations by putting up a sign indicating that a solar PV panel has been installed at that location. The Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) CSI administrators have even established "Solar Champion" training sessions for "citizens interested in helping spread the word about solar in their neighborhoods" (PG&amp;E 2011). A critical question for practitioners is where to target marketing efforts to best leverage social spillovers. As a starting point, we include zip code demographics and demographics interacted with the installed base in an OLS estimation of (4) to examine the determinants of adoption (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Our proxy for environmental preferences, hybrid vehicle adoption, has a large and highly statistically significant effect on the rate of adoption in a zip code. Higher adoption rates are also associated with the percentage of the population who are male, are white, have over a 30-minute commute, and have home repairs. Lower adoption rates are associated with variables such as the zip code population, percentage of people aged 20-45 and over 65, and zip codes with higher value homes.</p><p>To assess the conditions under which social spillovers are likely to be most effective, we estimate (5) and include interactions between the installed base and demographic variables. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We find that zip codes with larger household sizes and a higher fraction of people with more than a 30-minute commute have a larger peer effect, whereas zip codes with higher median household income and more people who carpool have a smaller peer effect. The significance of the household size and commuting variables may suggest that the mere visibility of installations may contribute to the peer effect; larger households have more eyes per household to see other adoptions of solar, and longer commutes may imply more driving time to see <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Because of the inclusion of demographics, we do not include zipquarter fixed effects in this estimation, and thus we view these results as suggestive. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The "main effects" from the demographics are differenced out.  Note. The unit of observation is zip code-day. * * * Significant at the 1% confidence level; * * Significant at the 5% level; * Significant at the 10% level. other installations. Carpooling may have the opposite effect by reducing driving time.</p><p>The interaction with median income is economically significant: running the regression on only the lower half of the zip code income distribution leads to a coefficient and standard error of 2.478 (0.680); for the top half, it is 1.243 (0.454). So although households with lower income may be less likely to adopt solar, they are more influenced by the peer effect. This is consistent with the high percentage of consumers naming finances as a primary reason for adopting solar, especially if the financial benefits of adoption are learned through information exchange. 12 4.1.3. Effect of Installation Size. If the visibility of installations matters, are peer effects stronger when the existing installations are larger? Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> provides evidence suggesting that this is likely to be the case. We estimate (5) using the installed base measured in megawatts as the explanatory variable of interest to allow larger installations to have a greater impact. Again, we find a positive, significant effect of the installed base (column 2). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> To assess the relative explanatory power of the installed base measured in terms of number of installations versus megawatts of installations, we estimate a model including both. We find that both become statistically insignificant (although jointly significant), so we cannot determine which is more important. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We hypothesize that the size of the installation may matter because larger installations are slightly more visible, but that spreading out the same number of megawatts over more homes increases the visibility even more.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Is the Peer Effect Contractor-Specific?</head><p>If the peer effect operates in part through word of mouth, one might expect the peer effect to be contractor-specific. To test this, we estimate (5) using the probability of an adoption in a zip code by a specific contractor as the dependent variable. We also include both the contractor-specific installed base and the total zip code installed base (both firstdifferenced) as explanatory variables. We estimate the model for the top five contractors by total installations (over 1,000 residential installations each). The coefficient on the contractor-specific installed base in all five of the regressions turns out to be statistically insignificant, suggesting that peer effects in solar PV have a limited contractor-specific effect. 15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Effect on Installation Size</head><p>Peer effects that work through information transfer may serve to reduce the uncertainty in the expected value of installations. For example, consumers may discuss tax incentives, rebates, or the actual production of a solar PV system. If consumers are risk averse, we would expect to see installation sizes increase as more neighbors adopt solar PV systems because larger installations are riskier (assuming the risk is per MW).</p><p>The summary statistics for the size and price of all residential installations are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> To test our prediction, we estimate a linear model of installation size (conditional on an installation occurring), first using OLS regression, then including zip code fixed effects, and finally using zip-quarter fixed effects. Because the installed base is no longer a predetermined variable, traditional fixed effects estimation provides a consistent estimate. We find a positive, significant coefficient on the zip code installed base when using zip code fixed effects, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> This is consistent with peer effects reducing the uncertainty of the solar PV investment, leading to larger installations on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Effect on Adoption at the Street Level</head><p>If peer effects are a major factor underlying the clustering pattern in the data, we might expect to see evidence of peer effects at a more localized level than the zip code. With 2001-2006 address-level data from the California Energy Commission Emerging Renewables Program, we can examine how solar PV system adoption decisions are affected by the previous decisions of others on the same street. We define a street here as a street within a zip code, so that a long street that is in several zip codes is considered several separate streets. We create a panel data set where an observation is a street-month. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref> provides summary <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Details can be found in the online appendix. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The installation price is adjusted by the CPI to real 2009 dollars per watt, and all watts in this paper are direct current watts. The average size of an installation is 5.24 kilowatts, with an average preincentive price of $8.49 per watt. This corresponds to an average system price in the range of $40,000 before incentives. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The significance disappears with zip-quarter fixed effects, but this is not surprising because we have only a single observation per installation. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Because of the vast number of streets, it is not possible to perform the analysis at the street-day level, but as installations on a    statistics, showing the number of new installations and previous installations in a street-month, as well as the installed base and number of completed contracts within each street's zip code.</p><p>We regress an indicator variable for an adoption on an indicator for an installation already having occurred on the street and the zip code installed base. Because many streets are in relatively early stages of adoption, we have sufficient variation for our analysis. Appendix B contains further details of our specification, and the results for two first-differences specifications (FD 1 and FD 2) are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>. The second column adds interactions between the installed base and zip code indicator variables to nonparametrically control for the unknown number of potential adopters on each street.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Further Evidence of Causal Peer Effects</head><p>Ideally, to test for causal peer effects, we would have two geographic areas with identical environmental preferences, demographics, and macroeconomic shocks. We would then randomly place a few solar PV installations in one of the areas to see whether the exogenously placed installations lead to additional installations. Because this ideal randomized experiment is not possible, our approach above flexibly controls for potential correlated unobservables and homophily. Our empirical setting also allows for an alternative approach to estimate causal peer effects motivated by the ideal experiment: two similar regions and a temporary, exogenous difference in incentives that serves to induce more installations in one region than the other. If the region with more installations continues to have a higher adoption rate once the difference is removed, then we can infer a causal effect of the extra installations on the rate of adoption. We use a difference-in-differences approach, focusing on zip codes located around the border between IOUs. We use 33 zip codes along the border between PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison (SCE) and 174 along the (more populous) border between SCE and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The CSI incentives are on a "step" schedule, whereby the incentives drop to a lower level once a certain number</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>The Difference-in-Differences Approach Exploits Changing Incentives for Zip Codes on the Utility Border</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Time Period C Period B Period A SDG&amp;E SCE Incentive</formula><p>of cumulative MW of solar PV technology has been installed in that administrative region. This implies that there are times when one CSI administrative zone moves to the next incentive step and for a limited period has lower incentives than the other CSI administrative zone, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. To examine the treatment effect of the extra installations, we estimate</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Y zt = 0 + 1 S i + 2 B i + 3 C i + 4 S i • B i + 5 S i • C i + z + z • t + i (6)</formula><p>where Y zt is defined as before, S i is an indicator for whether the electric utility received a "shock" of relatively higher incentives (e.g., SDG&amp;E in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>), B i is an indicator for the period of the higher incentive, and C i is an indicator for the period afterwards when the incentives were realigned. z are zip code indicators, t is a linear time trend, and i is a mean-zero stochastic error. We use the transition from step 5 to 6 for the PG&amp;E/SCE border and the transition from step 2 to 3 for the SCE/SDG&amp;E border for the analysis. These are the first steps with a large difference in the step transition times (62 and 181 days, respectively). <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>. As expected, the adoption rate is larger on the side of the border that did not change a step (i.e., had a relatively larger incentive). More important, the adoption rate remained higher after the incentives are realigned, providing further evidence for a causal effect of additional installations. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Previous steps are small-only 15 days between the transitions from step 4 to 5 for the PG&amp;E/SCE border and 1 day for the SCE/SDG&amp;E border-or the incentive transitions switch.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Comparison to Other Diffusion Models</head><p>As a benchmark and robustness check, we compare our results to those from other common models of technology diffusion. We begin with the canonical Bass model commonly used to study product diffusion with aggregate data. Appendix C provides details on the Bass model estimation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">11</ref> presents the estimation results, which are performed at the daily level. Column (1) shows the results using data aggregated over all zip codes. Columns (2) and (3) report the results at the zip code level, with and without zip code fixed effects. All three specifications yield similar results for the coefficient of imitation, q. The estimated value of q falls in the range reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sultan et al. (1990)</ref>. The estimated market potential is much larger for the aggregated data because it corresponds to all of California instead of a single zip code.   In the aggregate Bass model, we find that one additional installation increases the probability that a household adopts (q/m) by 4 51 × 10 −9 . This cannot be directly compared to our first-differences estimate (1 57 × 10 −6 ) because the aggregate model assumes that an installation affects the probability of adoption everywhere in California, rather than simply in the zip codes where adoption is occurring. This difference underscores why aggregate diffusion models are unsuitable for the estimation of localized peer effects. Interestingly, our results from the zip code-level Bass model turn out to be quite close to our preferred estimate of (5) and, in fact, are not statistically significantly different. Yet the average market size estimates from the disaggregate Bass model results are over twice the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code, suggesting that we may have reason to be concerned about the zip code-level Bass model results. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Although the Bass model is a useful benchmark, it may be more suitable to compare our approach to recent work in the marketing literature using disaggregated data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell and Song (2007)</ref> use a clever approach to identify social interactions in the adoption of online grocery retailing. They assume i.i.d. errors and use order statistics to derive an expression for the probability that at least one individual within a region makes use of the new technology. The authors estimate the model using maximum likelihood estimation. One concern about their approach is the reliance on i.i.d. errors across individuals, an assumption that would not hold if there are shocks that affect many individuals in a particular area. An advantage of this method is that only information on the first adoption in each market is necessary. However, this also limits the number of control variables; only two-digit zip code fixed effects can be used. This limitation is recognized by the authors, who also estimate a mixed proportional hazards model with a zip code random effect.</p><p>In this spirit, we estimate a hazard model with zip-quarter random effects and monthly indicators. This follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iyengar et al. (2011)</ref>, who use city and monthly indicators. The use of time controls is more flexible than a mixed proportional hazards model because it allows the hazard rate to vary as a flexible function of time rather than a predetermined parametric function of time. Using a Poisson model with the number of daily installations as the dependent variable, we find that adding an installation to the installed base increases the probability of a household installation by 0.011 (standard error of 0.0001). For an average zip code with 4,959 owner-occupied homes, this corresponds to a household effect of 2 198 × 10 −6 . This is quite close to our first-differenced results. One concern, however, is the assumption of orthogonality between the random effects and covariates.</p><p>We can include fixed effects rather than random effects in a model using the generalized method of moments estimator described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Woolridge (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Windmeijer (2000)</ref>. This method is computationally intensive and again assumes i.i.d. errors. We estimate the model using monthly aggregated data, where the dependent variable is the probability of a household adoption (in millionths). <ref type="bibr">22</ref> The resulting estimated coefficient is insignificant, possibly as a result of the computational necessity of monthly aggregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Implications for Practitioners</head><p>This paper provides a straightforward methodology for consistently estimating peer effects in the adoption of new technologies that display a lag between the time of adoption and delivery, and then it quantifies the magnitude of those peer effects. We find strong evidence for causal peer effects, indicating that an extra installation in a zip code increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points when evaluated at the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code. These peer effects appear to increase in magnitude over time and are greater for larger installations and at the more localized street level. Our findings also indicate that peer effects appear to lead to larger installations.</p><p>The results are suggestive of the pathways by which peer effects work: both visibility of the panels and word of mouth appear to contribute to social interactions that lead to further adoption. Accordingly, both image motivation and information transfer are likely to underlie the peer effects. These findings have clear implications for marketers who are striving to reduce the high cost of consumer acquisition in the solar PV market.</p><p>A first implication is that because visibility appears to enhance the peer effect, increasing the visibility of adoptions would be expected to increase the rate of adoption. Indeed, this strategy can be seen with several installers putting up signs indicating that a solar PV panel has been installed. Our finding that a larger installed base in a zip code leads to larger installations suggests that other methods of information provision may also lead to increased adoption levels. The use of demonstration sites has been shown to have positive effects on the adoption of green technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bollinger 2012)</ref>, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalish and Lilien (1986)</ref> caution us that such demonstrations for solar PV should only be used when the information to be learned is positive. Programs such as PG&amp;E's "Neighborhood Solar Champions" training program aim to leverage peer effects to provide such positive information to neighbors. Our finding of an increasing effect of new installations in a zip code suggests that targeting marketing efforts in areas that already have some installations is a promising strategy. Our demographic interaction results further suggest that efforts to leverage peer effects can be targeted to particular areas based on demographics, such as those with larger household sizes and many commuters.</p><p>The results in this paper are consistent with the latest developments in the solar PV market. Companies such as SolarCity and Sungevity have recognized that reducing the consumer uncertainty about installing solar is critical to expanding the market. These companies lease solar panels to consumers, performing the installation for free and taking care of all the maintenance. Furthermore, they guarantee the system will perform as promised or will pay the consumer the difference. By transferring the risk of installation to the installer, moral hazard issues may be reduced, leading to the installation of larger (and riskier) installations.</p><p>Many of the results in this paper are also likely to apply to the diffusion of other visible green technologies, such as hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, geothermal heating, and outdoor high-efficiency lighting. A decision support system for using this "analogue approach" to forecast diffusion is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Choffray and Lilien (1986)</ref>. We see many promising opportunities to further explore the influence of social interactions in other solar PV markets and other markets for green products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B. Details of Street-Level Analysis</head><p>As with the zip code model, we model the probability of a household adopting solar panels. However, unlike the analysis at the zip code level, we do not know the set of potential adopters on each street because we do not have information on the number of households on each street. However, we can overcome this issue. Let the probability of a household adopting solar on street s in zip code z in month be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Y sz = 1 m s s b s + z b z + X z + z + + sz</formula><p>where b st is the street-level installed base and m s is the unknown number of potential adopters. In this specification, we assume that the effect of previous installations on the street is smaller for streets with larger numbers of potential adopters because of the increased length of those streets.</p><p>If we multiply the equation on all sides by m s , we get to control for the unobserved number of potential entrants and isolate the effect of the street-level installed base, s . The large number of explanatory variables necessitates the use of streets with at least four installations; however, with the use of street-quarter fixed effects, these are the streets that provide the identifying variation anyway. Again, we estimate the model using first-differences to control for time-varying unobservables as well as for correlated preferences. Our standard errors are again robust to heteroskedaticity, which is present by construction.</p></div>
