<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In today's competitive environment, retailers face the complicated task of setting prices for many items. A typical grocery store in the United States carries around 31,000 items in approximately 600 product categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kahn and McAlister 1997)</ref>. A recent article underscores the complexity of the pricing problem: "While most companies are savvy about cutting costs, few have figured out how much money they are giving up by using 'lunk-headed' pricing due to a lack of detailed information about market demand" <ref type="bibr">(Business Week 2000)</ref>. Also, the trade press suggests that retailers lack good tools for making pricing decisions (AMR Research 2000), as they have been slow to adopt sophisticated pricing models <ref type="bibr">(Stores 2002)</ref>. Therefore, the actual retail prices observed over time may differ greatly from model-recommended courses of action.</p><p>As a result, uncovering the drivers of retail prices is of great importance to marketing executives and academics. Surprisingly, there has been little empirical research in this area. Two notable exceptions are <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chintagunta (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Shankar and Bolton (2004)</ref>. The former investigates category pricing behavior by decomposing retail prices into wholesale price, markup, additional promotional payments, retailer store brand objectives, and interretail competition for a single category in a single retail chain. Our study extends <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chintagunta's (2002)</ref> work by using time-series models to develop empirical generalizations on the impact dynamics of cost-, customer-, company-, competitor-, market-, and category-drivers of retail prices over time and across brands, categories, and stores/chains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Shankar and Bolton (2004)</ref> use a cross-sectional design to study pricing strategies, focusing on price consistency, price-promotion intensity, price-promotion coordination, and relative brand price level. In contrast, we study dynamic pricing tactics with a focus on uncovering the drivers of retail prices over time.</p><p>From a modeling perspective, our study shares the basic VARX approach with <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. (2004)</ref>. However, our research offers contributions in substantive, data, and methodological areas. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. (2004)</ref> consider whether manufacturers or retailers benefit more from price promotions, while we focus on the drivers of retail prices across brands and categories over time. Second, they study which brand, category, and market conditions influence price-promotion elasticities and the allocation of their benefits across manufacturers and retailers. In contrast, we link the influence of price drivers on retailer pricing tactics to retailer category margin while controlling for brand and category characteristics. Our study <ref type="bibr">Nijs,</ref><ref type="bibr">Srinivasan,</ref> Marketing Science 26(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">473-487, © 2007 INFORMS</ref> also offers several methodological contributions that are discussed in §3.</p><p>Our research contributes to the existing literature on retail-price drivers by answering three unresolved questions: What are the drivers of retailer pricing tactics over time? To what extent do these drivers account for the variation in retail prices over time? And, finally, how does the relative influence of these different drivers affect retailer margins? We address these questions in three empirical steps. First, we estimate the dynamic interactions between retail prices and their drivers using time-series models. Next, we use generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEVD) to quantify the relative influence of these drivers on retailer pricing. Finally, we analyze the association between retailer profits (category gross margin) and the influence of the price drivers on pricing as identified in Step 2.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the drivers of retailer pricing; §3 introduces the methodology; §4 presents the data; results in §5 show the relative prominence of price drivers; and §6 examines the link between the influence of these price drivers on retailer pricing tactics and retailer category margin. We conclude with managerial implications and suggestions for future research in §7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Retail-Price Drivers</head><p>Previous marketing literature suggests that retail prices for a focal brand are affected by competitive retailer pricing and store traffic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chintagunta 2002)</ref>, pricing history of the focal brand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Krishna et al. 2001)</ref>, demand for the focal brand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pesendorfer 2001)</ref>, wholesale prices of the focal brand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Krishna et al. 2001)</ref>, and category-management considerations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zenor 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive Retailer Activity</head><p>Competitive retailer activity is expected to influence retailer prices and performance. For instance, price promotions by competing retailers may reduce store traffic, inducing the retailer to lower prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chintagunta 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Hall et al. 1997</ref>). However, empirical evidence on the link between retail prices and store traffic/store switching is mixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chintagunta (2002)</ref> concludes retail prices have a weak impact on store traffic for the five brands under consideration in his study. Likewise, research by Walters and colleagues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Walters and MacKenzie 1988)</ref> indicates that the link is weak at best.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pricing History</head><p>Empirical studies on price rigidity show that a large proportion of the variation in prices, often in excess of 90%, is driven by pricing history <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dutta et al. 2002)</ref>. For example, past pricing actions-such as temporary price reductions-can boost sales, inducing the retailer to promote in subsequent periods even when it lowers retailer profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Einhorn and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hogarth 1986, Srinivasan et al. 2004)</ref>. Additional reasons for the dependency on pricing history include satisficing behavior due to limited information processing capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(March and Simon 1958)</ref>, formal budgeting rules that promote the status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hulbert 1981)</ref>, loss aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Tversky and Kahneman 1991)</ref>, and decision anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Plous 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Recent experiments by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Krishna et al. (2001)</ref> demonstrate that decision anchoring applies to retail pricing in the form of "a powerful tendency to rely on past prices in determining future prices" <ref type="bibr">(Krishna et al. 2001, p. 1)</ref>. When given a price history, the experiments' subjects set future prices too low, mostly because they give more weight to extreme observations (i.e., price deals) than to regular prices. This phenomenon reflects a perceptual averaging of past prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alba et al. 1999)</ref>. Moreover, after a price promotion, retail prices take a longer time to revert back to their mean than do sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Srinivasan et al. 2004)</ref>. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kopalle et al. (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hanssens (1999), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van Heerde et al. (2000)</ref> report that price promotions often lead to subsequent price promotions.</p><p>Given the convergent evidence from theory, experiments, and empirical analyses, we expect that retail prices for a focal brand will depend strongly on its past retail prices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brand Demand</head><p>Both marketing theory and practice suggest that a brand's level of demand is an important input into its pricing decisions. Indeed, a UK survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hall et al. 1997</ref>) reveals that retailers rate demand considerations as the most important price driver, ahead of wholesale prices and interretailer competition. In particular, low demand is often a motivation for remedial action, and (temporary) price reductions offer a quick fix to boost sales and meet performance quotas <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Neslin 2002)</ref>. Retailers understand the important relationship between price and demand and use that knowledge when setting retail prices (i.e., a brand's demand history affects its current and future prices).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wholesale Prices</head><p>Both retailer surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hall et al. 1997)</ref> and experimental studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krishna et al. 2001</ref>) confirm that costs are an important consideration for managers in setting retail prices. Almost half the marketing budget of consumer packaged goods manufacturers is allocated to trade deals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cox Direct 1998)</ref>. The extensive use of trade deals leads to frequent changes in wholesale prices and is an important determinant of retailer profitability (Economist 1992). Retail prices are not only affected by current but also by past wholesale prices, as retailers forward buy and anticipate trade deal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hall et al. 2002)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Srinivasan et al. (2000)</ref> Are performance and marketing variables (mean/trend) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pauwels et al. (2002)</ref> stationary or evolving (unit root)? Structural break test <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Perron (1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">) Deleersnyder et al. (2002</ref> Is there a structural break in the time-series of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Perron (1990)</ref> performance and price variables? <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Zivot and Andrews (1992)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category Management</head><p>The move towards category management (Progressive Grocer 2001) implies that retailers increasingly consider the demand, costs, and prices of competing brands in a joint decision-making process when setting prices for a focal brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zenor 1994)</ref>. Retailers set prices for different brands to maximize total category profits (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Raju et al. 1995)</ref>, and prefer to promote only one brand at a time in a given category <ref type="bibr">Wittink 1992, Tellis and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zufryden 1995)</ref>. Manufacturers' wholesale prices will affect the selection of the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hall et al. 2002)</ref> and may in turn influence the retail prices of all brands in a specific category <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>Our empirical analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we estimate the dynamic interactions between retail prices and their drivers using vector-autoregressive models with exogenous variables (VARX). Second, GFEVD is used to quantify the relative influence of these drivers on retailer pricing. Finally, the influence of these price drivers on retailer pricing tactics, identified in Step 2, is linked to retailer profitability. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides references for further details.</p><p>Step 1. Vector-Autoregressive Model Specification. VARX models are well suited to measure retailpricing dynamics. 1 First, the endogenous treatment 1 Our analysis focuses on cases where prices are either mean-or trend-stationary. Previous authors have shown that 96% of price series for the Dominick's data are stationary (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. 2004)</ref>. While the rare instances where there is evolution in prices may be interesting to analyze from a marketing standpoint, estimating (G)FEVD is infeasible since the variance for evolving variables is (theoretically) infinite.</p><p>of marketing actions implies that they are explained by both past marketing actions and past performance variables. Second, VARX models are able to capture complex feedback loops that may impact retail prices over time. For instance, a price promotion in a given week may generate a high demand response, inducing the retailer to offer additional price promotions in subsequent weeks. Competing retailers may respond with price promotions to maintain store traffic. By capturing such feedback loops, VARX estimation yields a comprehensive picture of observable retail-price drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pauwels 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In our empirical analysis, we use two different data sources: The first contains store-level data from the Denver area and the second contains store-level data from the Dominick's retail chain in the Chicago area. The Denver database provides information on competitive retail prices but not wholesale prices, while the Dominick's database contains information on wholesale prices and store traffic but not competitive retailer prices (see §4 for further details).</p><p>For the Denver database, we estimate a sevenequation VARX model per product category per store, where the endogenous variables are the sales volume for the top two brands (S i , i = 1 2), an other-brands composite S 3 , and the retail prices and competitive retail prices for the two major brands (RP i and CP i , i = 1 2). In addition to the intercept ( ), we add five sets of exogenous control variables: (i) a deterministic-trend t to capture the impact of omitted, gradually changing variables, (ii) a set of dummy variables HD that equal one in the shopping periods around major holidays <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chevalier et al. 2003)</ref> for seasonal fluctuations in sales or prices, (iv) a step dummy variable for the impact of new-product introductions NP , and (v) feature F and display D variables for each brand (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pauwels et al. 2002, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. 2004</ref> for a similar specification). To avoid overparameterization, we include feature and display as exogenous variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Pesaran and Smith 1998)</ref>. Recent research has shown little is gained by allowing for more intricate feature and display dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nijs et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Van Heerde et al. 2000</ref>.

We use a stepwise procedure to determine the appropriate lag-length K and to eliminate redundant parameters (details are provided in Appendix A.1). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For the Dominick's database we estimate an elevenequation VARX model per category per store, with sales volume of the top three brands (S i , i = 1 2 3), an other-brands composite (S 4 , wholesale and retail prices of the top three brands WP i and RP i , i = 1 2 3), and store traffic ST , a proxy for interretailer competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chintagunta 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The exogenous variables are the same as those in Equation (1). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Our use of VARX models warrants further discussion in light of recent attention to the implications of the Lucas critique for marketing research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bronnenberg et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Franses 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Van Heerde et al. 2005</ref>. In contrast to structural models, our reduced-form models do not allow us to interpret individual coefficients or draw normative implications. Instead, a reduced-form VARX model is appropriate for "innovation accounting" <ref type="bibr">(Enders 2004, p. 280)</ref>, i.e., providing descriptive insights on the patterns observed in the data using variance decomposition and/or impulse response analysis. The purpose of this paper is to assess which factors drive retail prices over time. Hence, we do not impose structural restrictions on the dynamic relations between variables (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sims 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Sudhir 2001</ref>. Rather, we focus on developing a rich and flexible empirical model of retail pricing (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Besanko et al. 2005</ref> for a recent discussion of the merits of reduced-form models). An important assumption of our approach is that innovations or "shocks" do not alter the nature of the underlying data-generating process <ref type="bibr">(Darnell and Evans 1990, p. 121</ref>). Since we are interested in tactical "day-today" pricing rather than strategic regime changes, the use of a reduced-form VARX model is appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Van Heerde et al. 2005)</ref>. Moreover, the proposed VARX model explicitly accounts for endogeneity, an important threat to consistency <ref type="bibr">(Franses 2005, p. 12)</ref>.</p><p>Step 2. Price Drivers Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. We use GFEVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pesaran and Shin 1998)</ref> to quantify the dynamic influence of competitive retail prices, brand demand, wholesale price and competitive wholesale price, and category-management considerations on a brand's retail price. In essence, GFEVD provides a measure of the relative impact over time of shocks initiated by each of the individual endogenous variables in a VARX model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hanssens 1998</ref> for a marketing application of FEVD). <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Analogous to a "dynamic R 2 ," it calculates the percentage of variation in retailer pricing for a brand that can be attributed to both contemporaneous and past changes in each of the endogenous variables in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) (including retailer pricing for the brand itself, i.e., pricing history). An important issue in standard FEVD is the need to impose a causal ordering for model identification purposes. In practical applications of FEVD, available theory is often insufficient to justify the selection of one ordering over another. Indeed, since we seek to identify and quantify drivers of retail prices, any imposed ordering appears troublesome. Therefore, we minimize the impact of variable ordering by estimating GFEVD (Pesaran and Shin 1998) using Equation (2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g ij t = t l=0 g ij l 2 t l=0 m j=1 g ij l 2 i j = 1 m (2)</formula><p>where g ij l is the value of a generalized impulse response function (GIRF) following a one standarderror shock to variable j on variable i at time l. In the GFEVD approach, an initial shock is allowed to-but need not depending on the size of the corresponding residual correlation-affect all other endogenous variables instantaneously. Generalized IRFs, which rely on an equivalent assumption, have recently been applied in a marketing setting by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nijs et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pauwels et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. (2004)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Steenkamp et al. (2005)</ref>. For details on the calculation of GIRFs, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nijs et al. (2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Moreover, our GFEVD metric is an extension <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The proposed VARX model does not assume that if week k contains a shock, week k + 1 does not. If, for example, a price promotion in the data always lasts three weeks, this is accounted for in the model. These subsequent shocks are not considered as separate shocks to the system but as an initial shock and its subsequent effects. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The use of impulse response functions to calculate the forecast error variance decomposition is equivalent to using forecast errors. See <ref type="bibr">Lütkepohl (1993, §2.3.3</ref>) and Pesaran and Shin (1998) for a similar approach.

The Influence of Retail-Price Drivers and Retailer Profits. In the final step of our analysis, we investigate the link between the influence of the price drivers on retailer pricing tactics identified in Step 2 and retailer category margin. We are mainly interested in how the influence of these retail-price drivers on retailer pricing tactics is related to retailer margins; however, we do control for a series of covariates based on prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bell et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Blattberg et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Narasimhan et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Nijs et al. 2001</ref>. Specifically, we estimate the following regression equation:  Note. From GFEVD, we obtain the estimates in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2, 3</ref>, and 4 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">MARGIN jk = 0 + 1 ST I ijk +</formula><p>For the Denver data, price drivers are measured as follows:</p><p>• Competitive retail activity is measured as the sum of the following two drivers: Competitive retail price same brand (CRPS) is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by the prices of the same brand charged by competing retailers. 9</p><p>Competitive retail price competing brand (CRPC) is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by the price of the competing brand charged by competing retailers. • Pricing history PH is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by past prices.</p><p>• Brand demand BD is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by a brand's sales volume.</p><p>• Category management is measured as the sum of the following two drivers:</p><p>Category management price (CMP) is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by the price of the competing brand in the category.</p><p>Category management demand (CMD) is the percentage of variability in retail prices accounted for by the sales volume of the competing brand in the category.

However, the standard errors of these parameters may be biased since the price drivers are estimated with error. We use the bootstrap method outlined in Appendix A.2 to obtain corrected standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of Equation (</head><p>In addition to the substantive differences to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. (2004)</ref> outlined in the introduction, our paper offers important contributions in terms of methodology and richness of data. First, we analyze an additional data set to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan et al. (2004)</ref>: The Denver data, for which competing retailer prices are available. Second, while they study 25 categories within a single retail chain, our study is based on an analysis of 10,850 brand-store combinations in multiple chains in two retail markets. As such, the extensive data allow us to draw meaningful empir-ical generalizations. Third, while they use impulse response functions, we apply generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEVD) for the first time in marketing. Our estimates are obtained from a rich VARX model to which we apply an innovative specification algorithm that ensures well-behaved residuals and model parsimony. This allows us to accurately quantify the influence on a brand's retail price of its own past price, competitive retail prices, brand demand, wholesale price and competitive wholesale price, and category-management considerations. Finally, we develop a bootstrap algorithm to correct the standard error bias introduced when using OLS to estimate Equation (3).</p><p>To review and illustrate our approach, Panel A in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows output of the GFEVD for two brands in a Dominick's store in the toothbrush category. Panel B in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the GFEVD for two brands in the cheese category in the same Dominick's store.</p><p>Past price dependence is the dominant driver for the two brands in the toothbrush category, explaining respectively (72%, 74%) of the variation in prices. Brand demand accounts for only (5%, 7%) of the variation. The influence of the other price driverscategory-management considerations (demand, price, and costs of competing brands), wholesale prices, and store traffic-is (23%, 19%) respectively. In sharp contrast to the toothbrush category, past price dependence explains (39%, 41%) of the variation in retail prices for the two brands in the cheese category. Brand demand accounts for (27%, 22%) and wholesale prices account for (21%, 21%) of the variation; category-management considerations and store traffic account for the remainder of the variation in retail prices (13%, 16%).</p><p>The average weekly retailer gross margin in a category is $510 per store. For the toothbrush category (Panel A, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the weekly retail profit is no more than $39, i.e., 92% below the $510 average crosscategory profit. In contrast, the weekly retail profit is $2,018 for the cheese category (Panel B, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), i.e., a striking 295% above average. In the former case, a higher emphasis on pricing history in setting retail prices is associated with lower retailer margins. In contrast, in the latter case, a higher emphasis on brand demand in setting retail prices is associated with higher retailer margins. Evidently, besides price drivers, these categories may also show differences in the characteristics included as covariates in Equation (3). The relevant question then becomes whether these examples are representative of a more general pattern. We investigate this issue in § §5 and 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Description</head><p>We use data from two sources: store-level scanner data from multiple retail chains in the Denver market and from the Dominick's retail chain in Chicago. We describe the databases below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Denver Data</head><p>Data from the Denver market, provided by ACNielsen, consists of weekly store-level data for the period January 1993 through May 1995 (123 weeks). <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For each of 55 supermarkets, the data contain the weekly sales, prices, newspaper feature ads, and in-aisle display activity for each of the products carried in 43 categories. We focus on the top two brands in each category in each store: a total of 4,730 brand-store combinations. This data set offers the opportunity to evaluate the impact of competitive retailer activity on pricing; however, it does not have information on wholesale prices charged by manufacturers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Dominick's Data</head><p>The second database contains scanner records for 24 product categories in 85 Dominick's stores, one of the two largest retail chains in the Chicago area. Data are available from September 1989 to May 1997, a total of 399 weeks. Variables include sales, retail and wholesale prices, feature and display, and store traffic. We focus on the top three brands in each category in each store, a total of 6,120 brand-store combinations. This data set allows us to investigate the link between the influence of the price drivers and retailer category margin; however, it does not contain information on prices in competing retail stores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results: Retail-Price Drivers</head><p>Based on our GFEVD analysis we derive empirical generalizations on the drivers of retail prices (summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>). Detailed findings per category are reported for the Denver data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> and for the Dominick's data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Recent economic research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ball and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mankiw 1994, Wynne 1995)</ref> argues that weekly store-level price data of small representative staple retail items are the most appropriate for studying the drivers of retail prices, since the retailer actually sets final goods prices, typically on a weekly level. Moreover, previous research finds that supermarket chains similar to Dominick's change prices of as many as 15% of the products they carry every week, in spite of the fact that their cost of changing prices compromises over 35% of their net margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Levy et al. 1997</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive Retail Activity</head><p>For the Denver data, competitive retailer prices account for 5.5% (3.1% + 2.4%) of the fluctuations in retail prices across the 43 categories. This finding is consistent with previous research which suggests that, even though retailers track each others' prices, interretailer competition accounts for only a small proportion of the variation in retail prices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Urbany et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Chintagunta 2002</ref>). Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rao et al. (1995)</ref> demonstrate that retail-price promotions are essentially independent across competitors. Their theoretical explanation is that retail-price promotions are competitive mixed strategies. Since each firm is uncertain about its competitors' strategies, its promotion (re)actions must be independent of its competitors' actions. Hence, competitive retailer promotions should also be independent, a claim validated by our empirical results. For the Dominick's data, we use store traffic as a proxy for interretailer competition. We find that lower store traffic triggers only a minimal dynamic price response in subsequent weeks. This result is generalized across all categories and consistent with previous reports of weak links between price promotions and store traffic (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rinne 1986, Walters and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mackenzie 1988)</ref>. Our findings are also in line with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Shankar and Bolton (2004)</ref> who study strategic pricing issues (a comparison of findings is available at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pricing History</head><p>A brand's past prices are the dominant driver of retail prices in each category studied, accounting for 62.3% of the dynamic variation in retail prices for the Denver data and 49.6% for the Dominick's data. This confirms the "powerful tendency to rely on past prices in determining future prices" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krishna et al. 2001)</ref>. We investigate the performance implications of this behavior in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brand Demand</head><p>Brand demand accounts for approximately 15.9% of the variation in retail prices for the Denver data and 11.4% of the variation in retail prices for the Dominick's data. These results indicate that retailers acknowledge the essential relationship between prices and sales and incorporate demand considerations into retail pricing decisions <ref type="bibr">(Hall et al. 1997). 11</ref> Wholesale Price Wholesale prices are an important driver of retail prices across categories and account for 26.4% of the variance in retail price in the Dominick's data set, second only to pricing history. Retailers clearly take wholesale prices into consideration when setting retail prices. Information on wholesale prices is not available for the Denver data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category Management</head><p>Category-management considerations account for 9.6% 3 0% + 6 6% of the variation in retail prices in the Denver data, and for 7.9% 2 5% + 2 8% + 2 6% of the variation in retail prices for the Dominick's data. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Consistent with reported practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hall et al. 2002)</ref>, category-management considerations are less important in driving retail prices compared to pricing history and brand demand.</p><p>A notable exception to this empirical generalization is the highly competitive soft drink category, where competing brands' demand, costs, and prices account for over 26.1% of variation in prices (Dominick's). Prior evidence of alternating retail-price promotions by major competitors Coca-Cola and Pepsi (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lal 1990</ref>) offers a plausible explanation for this result. Furthermore, for Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the Dominick's stores, the brand's price accounts for approximately 47% of the variation while competitive price accounts for 17%, close to a 3:1 ratio for the two components (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Krishna 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, across 10,850 brand-store combinations in 67 categories in two different retail areas, we find the following order of importance among retail-price drivers for the Denver and Dominick's data sets: pricing history (62.3%, 49.6%), wholesale price (26.4%, Dominick's only), brand demand (15.9%, 11.4%), category management (9.6%, 7.9%), and retail competition (5.5% Denver data only)/store traffic (0.7% Dominick's data only). Our results from Step 2 show considerable variability in the relative importance of price drivers across categories, which we explore next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results: The Influence of Retail-Price Drivers and Retailer Profits</head><p>In the third and final step of our empirical analysis, we examine the link between retailer gross category margin and the influence of each driver on retail <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Since the Denver data lack wholesale price information, results may be overstated due to the fact that wholesale price changes could cause correlation between a brand's price and the prices/ demand of other brands in the category. This correlation can arise because retailers-attempting to entice category consumers to buy a certain brand-may adjust brand prices in response to a reduction in wholesale prices of competing brands in the product category <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>.  pricing (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). We conduct this step only for the Dominick's data set since retailer category margins are not available for the Denver data. We tested for endogeneity by conducting the Hausman-Wu test for each potentially endogenous variable in Equation (3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davidson and</ref><ref type="bibr">MacKinnon 1993, Gielens and</ref>. None of the tests revealed a violation of the exogeneity assumption (p &gt; 0 05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive Retailer Activity</head><p>Our findings indicate that when store traffic considerations feature more prominently in retailer pricing, retailer margins are lower. This may occur if the added revenues from incremental demand are not large enough to compensate for the margin loss on subsidized sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Drèze 1995)</ref>. As expected, pricing a category as a loss leader can diminish category profits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pricing History</head><p>The rationale for past price dependence is a debated issue in the marketing and economics literature.

As the influence of past price dependence in retail pricing is associated with lower retailer margins, our results are consistent with the former view and confirm both anecdotal (Business Week 2000) and experimental evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krishna et al. 2001</ref>) of limited managerial sophistication in pricing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brand Demand</head><p>Being customer-oriented requires a detailed understanding of the dynamic price-demand response of consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hall et al. 1997)</ref>. For instance, unsatisfactory performance may lead managers to take corrective marketing and pricing actions to improve results in subsequent periods. Such demand understanding should increase the profit impact for the retailer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hall et al. 2002)</ref>. Our results suggest that demand-based considerations in retail pricing are indeed associated with higher retailer profitability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wholesale Price</head><p>In contrast, the influence of wholesale prices in retailer price setting does not significantly impact retailer margins. This does not imply that retailers should ignore costs. However, it suggests that rigid adherence to a cost-plus pricing approach does not hurt or benefit retail category margins. Since manufacturers may have different goals and payoffs from promotions (e.g., Villas-Boas and Lal 1998), it is not always in the best interest of the retailer to simply pass through manufacturer price changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>. Instead, pass-through rates should depend on retailer profit considerations, such as category management and the price sensitivity of consumer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Moorthy 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Tyagi 1999</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Category Management</head><p>We find that the category management price driver is associated with higher retailer margin. This finding lends support to the promise of increased retailer profitability from the adoption of category-management pricing practices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zenor 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">, Progressive Grocer 2001</ref>. Most notably, it is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Hall et al.'s (2002)</ref> demonstration that a retailer would benefit from moving from single brand profit optimization to category profit optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implications and Conclusions</head><p>Based on our analysis of 10,850 brand-store combinations in 67 categories in two retail areas, we conclude that retail prices are driven by, in order of importance, (1) pricing history, (2) wholesale prices, (3) brand demand, (4) category management, and (5) store traffic/interretailer price competition. Our study offers several actionable implications for marketing researchers, manufacturers, and retailers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Marketing Researchers</head><p>Our approach offers several improvements over extant methodology. First, our VARX model specification algorithm enhances efficiency and parsimony. It ensures that the model residuals are well behaved (i.e., no autocorrelation) while limiting the level of parameterization. This is especially important given the size of the VARX needed to study price drivers and the high degree of autocorrelation found in both databases used in this research. Second, we apply GFEVD for the first time in marketing. Finally, we develop a bootstrap procedure to correct the standard error bias introduced when using OLS to estimate an econometric model where some of the independent variables are estimated quantities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Manufacturers</head><p>First, our extensive analysis of price drivers provides insights into interbrand competition by quantifying the extent to which prices and demand of competing brands determine retail prices. Second, our findings indicate which manufacturers/brands need to be most concerned about competitive brands. This is reflected in the relative importance of competitive brands' prices and brand demand as drivers of the focal brand's retail price. Third, our study helps manufacturers get a better understanding of retail pricing and the extent to which price fluctuations are driven by the wholesale prices charged to individual retail chains. These insights cannot be obtained just by observing retail prices due to the confounding effects of other retail-price drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Retailers</head><p>First, from a retailer's perspective, the striking differences in price-driver importance across brands and categories should give pause. Are these differences intentional? Did they result from a routine based on principles that were once valid but are now obsolete? While only retailers themselves can truly answer these questions, our findings can help them pose the right questions. Second, retailers are interested in the extent of interretail competition in their markets: Strong competitive pricing reaction could greatly affect the outcome of their own actions. Our findings on interretail competition help retailers put such competitive concerns into perspective. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of understanding which retail-price drivers improve profit performance. Specifically, customer-oriented, or demand-based, pricing combined with the move towards ECR and category management has positive bottom-line profit implications, while rigid adherence to cost-plus pricing by the retailer does not help (or hurt) margins. Moreover, our research shows that pricing a category as a loss leader will hurt category profitability while inertia in retail-price setting is also decidedly unprofitable. Overall, our findings raise several important questions for future research. Why is pricing history such a dominant driver of retail-price setting? Interviews with retailers may reveal motivations such as pricing complexity, preference for the status quo, fear of competitive reaction, etc. Although our current research has assessed the link between (1) the influence of price drivers on retailer pricing and (2) retailer category margins, future studies should seek explanations for the observed differences in the influence of price drivers across categories. Indeed, the antecedents of price drivers could be related to specific brand, market structure, and product-category characteristics.</p><p>Our study has several limitations that are at the same time opportunities for future research. First, the Dominick's database provides information on wholesale prices and margins but lacks data on manufacturer promotional expenses such as slotting allowances, buy-back charges, and failure fees. Second, our data do not allow us to account for certain potential retailprice drivers such as manufacturer advertising and other brand building activities. Third, due to data limitations we are not able to specify models that incorporate both wholesale prices and retailer competition simultaneously. Fourth, we include the top two brands in the model for the Denver data and the top three brands in the model for the Dominick's data. Ideally, we would include data on all brands but this would significantly increase the level of parameterization in our model and severely limit our ability to provide detailed estimates of pricing dynamics. Fifth, we analyze each product category separately. Further research is needed to investigate possible dependencies in pricing across categories. Finally, although our study uncovers associations between the influence of price drivers on pricing and performance, it cannot prove the existence of causal relationships.</p><p>We conclude by suggesting that retailers need to find opportunities to price products in a manner that will enhance profitability in an industry where margins are under ever-increasing pressure. We identify the price drivers that generate these opportunities. Moreover, our research sheds light on the trade-offs that retailers face when focusing on the different drivers of retail prices. Understanding and formalizing these trade-offs remains a fascinating area for marketing researchers and practitioners.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Retail-Price Drivers for Two Leading Brands in Two Categories-Dominick's Data Panel A: Toothbrush category Panel B: Cheese category</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">An alternative method to resolve parameterization concerns is to pool across stores. In our study this would, however, reduce the number of estimates available for studying the link between the influence of the drivers on pricing and retailer performance, introducing a potential "degrees of freedom problem" in Step 3 of our analysis. We aim to achieve a balance between accuracy and statistical adequacy through the adopted VARX specification.3 It is possible that the retailer sets prices interdependently across categories. An empirical analysis of correlations among price residuals across categories indicates, however, that such dependencies are small to negligible. To the extent that they do exist, these effects can be captured by the store traffic variable<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chintagunta 2002)</ref>. As such, we leave the issue of cross-category price and demand dependencies for future research.4  Feature and display indicators are called "price specials" and "bonus buys" in the Dominick's data description (http://gsbwww. uchicago.edu/research/mkt/Databases/DFF/W.html). Following<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chintagunta et al. (2003)</ref>, we refer to these marketing activities using the more common labels "feature" and "display." We operationalize the variables as the percentage of SKUs of the brands that are promoted in a given week.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Previous studies have shown that a period of 26 weeks (two quarters) is sufficient for stationary series in consumer-packaged goods to capture dynamic effects<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pauwels and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Srinivasan 2004, Srinivasan et al. 2004</ref>).8  Because our estimates of the price drivers sum to one, we must exclude one of them from Equation (3) to avoid perfect multicollinearity. Since category management considerations are measured by three metrics, we exclude one metric, namely, category demand.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">For private label brands, CRPS is the price of the private label product in the same category in competing retail stores. We argue that this is the relevant comparison because private labels are likely to be in similar price tiers, and are used to compete with other retailers. For instance, in the ongoing Dutch retailing price war, several of the price-cutting rounds involved the private label of the initiating retailer, to which the competing retailers responded by cutting prices on their own private labels<ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Van Aalst et al. 2005</ref>).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">As mentioned in §2, retailers may form expectations on trade deal patterns. Such expectations are captured in the VARX model estimates since expectations are formed based on past realizations of the data-generating process. Future research could attempt to explicitly capture such expectations, perhaps by incorporating leads of wholesale prices, as in Van Heerde et al.(2000).</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A</head><p>A.1. VARX Specification To accurately estimate (G)FEVD, it is important to include all relevant, endogenous variables in the VARX model used to derive them. Our setting requires a large VARX model (seven equations for the Denver data, eleven equations for the Dominick's data). Models of this size quickly run into parameterization problems. For example, adding one lag to an eleven-equation VARX would require the estimation of 121 additional parameters. A commonly used approach is to estimate the model with differing lags and select the specification that minimizes some criterion variable (e.g., BIC or AIC). Given the size of our VARX models, this approach is likely to either (1) select a lag-length that is too short for some of the endogenous variables, causing autocorrelated residuals, or (2) lead to overparameterization. To ensure that residuals are well behaved (i.e., no autocorrelation) and the model is not overparameterized, we use a fivestep procedure to specify a subset VARX model. This procedure is outlined below and builds on work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lütkepohl (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bruggeman and Lütkepohl (2001)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Lütkepohl and Krätzig (2004)</ref>.</p><p>1. For each individual equation in the VARX, determine the lag-length that minimizes the BIC criterion. The equation will include the same number of lags of all endogenous variables. 2. Determine if the residuals for each VARX equation are free of autocorrelation using the Breusch-Godfrey LM test <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lütkepohl 1993</ref>). If the null of no autocorrelation is rejected, add lags until the autocorrelation is successfully removed or a maximum number of lags has been included. For the Denver data set, we use a maximum of six lags; for the Dominick's data, the maximum is set to eight. If autocorrelation problems persist after the maximum number of lags has been reached, additional lags may be added for only the endogenous variable for the equation under investigation. Up to six or eight additional lags are allowed for the Denver and Dominick's data sets, respectively. Residual autocorrelation tests are conducted after each equation revision.</p><p>3. Once the basic lag structure has been determined for each equation, the individual parameter estimates are evaluated to determine if the level of parameterization can be reduced. In each equation, the parameter with the smallest t-statistic, in absolute value, is removed. Parameters are then reestimated and evaluated on their t-statistic. This procedure is repeated until all remaining parameters have a t-statistic larger than one in absolute value <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bruggeman and Lütkepohl 2001)</ref>. It has been shown that utilizing the t-statistic in this manner is equivalent to using either the BIC or AIC criterion, depending on the threshold value for parameter elimination <ref type="bibr">(Lütkepohl and Krätzig 2004)</ref>.</p><p>4. Autocorrelation tests are again conducted for each equation. If any of the tests show evidence of autocorrelation, the results of the model are dropped from further analysis.</p><p>5. The parameters of the subset VARX model are estimated by FGLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hamilton 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The model specification procedure outlined above allows us to estimate large VARX models that are not significantly overparameterized and yet still ensure that the residuals are well behaved. The average parameter to observation ratio is 1:5.65 for the Denver data set and 1:10.4 for the Dominick's data set. Note that despite the flexibility of our VARX specification approach, 26.9% (Denver) and 15.2% (Dominick's) of models show evidence of residual autocorrelation (AC cases). This result emphasizes the need to correct for marketing dynamics when conducting empirical research on scanner data. See Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.1 below for additional measures of VARX model fit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B B.1. Variable Operationalization</head><p>Retailer profitability. For the retailer, we compute the retailer's total category margins (defined in dollars) as RM t = I i=I S i t × P i t − WP i t , where i denotes the brand and I is the total number of brands in the category.</p><p>Store traffic. Store traffic is defined as the total number of customers visiting the store that buy at least one item in a given week.</p><p>Holiday dummy variables. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chevalier et al. (2003)</ref>, we specify dummy variables that equal one in the shopping periods around the following holidays: Lent, Easter, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, the week following Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the Super Bowl. Since front-end candy (one of the categories we analyze) is less likely to be bought immediately after Halloween, we add an additional dummy variable for the week following the holiday. For consistency, these 11 holiday dummy variables are incorporated in all categories analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2. Retail Competition</head><p>In the absence of information on the location of stores in the Denver database, we empirically identify stores that are considered by consumers as close competitors. Specifically, competitive retail prices for the top two brands were determined using information on shopping behavior from a consumer panel. For a store, the average competitive price charged for a brand at time t is a weighted average of the prices charged for that brand in all other stores. The weights are determined by counting the number of people in the panel that shop in both the focal and the competing store. To illustrate the computation, suppose we have one brand (X), three stores (A, B, and C), and 100 consumers. If 50 consumers shop at stores A and B and ten consumers shop at stores A and C, this suggests that stores A and B are closer competitors than stores A and C. The competitive retail price for brand X included in a time-series model for store A would be calculated as (50 × price X in store B + 10 × price X in store C)/60.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3. Covariates</head><p>We operationalize the covariates used in Step 3 of our analysis as follows:</p><p>National brand vs. private label NB . A dummy variable indicates whether the promoting brand is a national brand =1 or a private label =0 .</p><p>Promotional frequency PROM_FRQ . We define promotional frequency as the number of weeks in which negative price-promotion shocks are at least 5% of the brand's regular price. The regular price, in turn, is defined as the maximum price of the brand, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Raju (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Foekens et al. (1999)</ref>. The category-level measure is calculated as the market-share weighted average of the promotional frequency of the brands in the category.</p><p>Promotional depth PROM_DPT . A brand's price-promotion depth is defined as the difference (%) between a promotional price (as defined for the frequency count) and the brand's regular price. The category-level measure is calculated as the market-share weighted average of the promotional depth of the brands in the category.</p><p>Category concentration CAT_CONC . We measure the category concentration as the cumulative market share of the top three brands.</p><p>Number of brands NRBR . The number of brands in the category is included to capture the extent of brand proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Narasimhan et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Impulse buying IMPULSE and storability STOCK .
