<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract. When financially distressed firms have overwhelming debts, a prominent option for survival is to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We empirically study the effect of Chrysler's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on the quantity sold by its competitors in the U.S. auto industry. The demand for competitors could increase because they may benefit from the distress of the bankrupt firm (competitive effect). By contrast, competitors could experience lower sales if the bankruptcy increases consumer uncertainty about their own viability (contagion effect). A challenge to measuring the impact of bankruptcies is the coincident decline in economic conditions stemming from the Great Recession and the potential effect of the "cash for clunkers" program (among other confounding factors). To identify the effect of the bankruptcy filing, we employ a regression-discontinuity-in-time design based on a temporal discontinuity in treatment (i.e., bankruptcy filing), along with an extensive set of control variables. Such a design is facilitated by a unique data set at the dealer-model-day level that allows us to compare changes in unit sales in close temporal vicinity of the filing. We find that unit sales for an average competitor decrease by 28% following Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Several types of evidence suggest that this negative demand spillover effect is driven by a heightened consumer uncertainty about the viability of the bankrupt firm's rivals. For example, we show that the sales of competitors' vehicles that compete within the same segments as the bankrupt firm's vehicles or that provide lower value for money are affected more negatively in response to the Chrysler filing. We also observe more web search activity for Chrysler's competitors after the filing. Our findings are robust to different estimation strategies (global versus local), different functional forms, different estimation windows, the inclusion of various controls (e.g., "cash for clunkers," incentives, advertising, inventory, recalls, price, and consumer confidence), the donut regression discontinuity approach, a potential serial correlation issue, a falsification exercise, and the inclusion of differential trends at various levels. Our study aims to inform policymakers and managers about unintended short-term demand consequences of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When financially distressed firms have overwhelming debt or face large uncertain legal liability, a prominent option for survival is to file for bankruptcy to seek protection from their creditors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Franks and Torous 1989)</ref>. One of the most extensively used bankruptcy formats by corporations is Chapter 11 bankruptcy, whereby a firm reorganizes its business under court supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Altman and Hotchkiss 2010)</ref>. Between 2008 and 2015, around 10,300 businesses filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States alone (www.abi.org). Surprisingly, scant research exists on the impact of firm debt on marketing outcomes like consumer satisfaction and consumer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Malshe and Agarwal 2015)</ref>, despite the call for studies that examine the interface of the marketing function with other business functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kumar 2015)</ref>. In particular, little is known on how Chapter 11 filing impacts consumer demand for the bankrupt firms' competitors.</p><p>Intuitively, when a firm files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, ceteris paribus, the bankrupt firm could face reduced demand as a result of this negative event. Even worse, the consumers of the bankrupt firm might switch to its competitors, resulting in a "competitive effect." The literature on the stock price reactions of competitors to bankruptcies implies that the opposite prediction is also possible. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Warner (1977)</ref> argues that if a bankruptcy reveals negative information about the industry, then competitors' outcomes (i.e., stock prices) could be negatively affected, which is referred to as "contagion effect." However, the empirical evidence is inconclusive regarding the interplay between the contagion and competitive effects when it comes to stock price reactions. Consistent with the dominant contagion effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lang and Stulz (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ferris et al. (1997)</ref> report that the stock prices of competitors decline in response to bankruptcy announcements. Similarly, using an event study approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akhigbe et al. (2005)</ref> find a significant contagion effect in terms of stock returns on large and key competitors of World-Com, whose bankruptcy is one of the largest in the U.S. history. By contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cheng and McDonald (1996)</ref> show significant contagion effects in the railroad industry, but they find significant competitive effects in the airline industry. Finally, using a sample of bankruptcy filings from a single legal regime, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haensly et al. (2001)</ref> do not find support for either a contagion or competitive effect in terms of equity value.</p><p>Although the above studies shed important light on several aspects of bankruptcy filings on competitive outcomes, they do not provide a consistent and complete picture. First, as discussed above, the empirical evidence is mixed for stock market reactions regarding which effect outweighs the other in affecting the net outcome of bankruptcy filings for competitors.</p><p>Second, it is not clear whether the findings of the aforementioned studies extend to the impact of bankruptcies on competitors' unit sales (as opposed to stock prices). While the stock-price effect reflects investors' response to the bankruptcy, the unit-sales effect is based on consumers' reactions. For investors, a dominant contagion effect in stock prices might arise when a filing conveys negative information about the stock market values of competitors. The stock market value reflects the expected present value of a firm's future cash flows. While cash flows are correlated with sales, there are many other components of cash flows, such as operating costs and the riskiness of future cash flows. Although negative information on these components are taken into account by investors, it is less relevant for consumers, who mainly consider the value of purchasing a product. Thus, the impact of bankruptcy on sales cannot be directly gleaned from its impact on stock prices.</p><p>Third, given their focus on stock price reactions, the previous studies in the finance literature examine the effect of bankruptcy announcements at the firm level. However, when it comes to consumer demand response, it is possible that some products of a given competitor are more prone to a dominant contagion or competitive effect than others based on the similarity between the product lines of the bankrupt firm and its competitors. Unfortunately, the current literature does not provide any guidance related to the product-level implications of bankruptcy filings, which is critical for marketing scholars and practitioners.</p><p>Fourth, there is little empirical analysis of demand effects of bankruptcies in a durable-good setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hotchkiss et al. 2008)</ref>. In a durable-good context, the consumption stream that the goods provide depends on services like warranties, maintenance, and upgrades. In addition, in industries such as the automobile industry, the items represent one of the most expensive purchases for consumers. For these reasons, consumers have a lot at stake when evaluating options in response to a negative event. Therefore, the magnitude of a dominant contagion or competitive effect could be substantially higher than other industries examined in the literature such as the airline industry.</p><p>Collectively, the above research gaps show the need for a better understanding of the influence of Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings on the unit sales of rival firms' products. If the customers in a product category interpret the bankruptcy event as a negative event specific for the bankrupt firm, then one expects that the competitive effect would dominate the contagion effect. If, by contrast, ambiguous information about the bankrupt firm's future promotions, products, and services forces consumers to revise their beliefs about the purchasing environment in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shiu et al. 2011)</ref>, then the contagion effect might dominate. For example, in an experimental study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roehm and Tybout (2006)</ref> provide evidence for the existence of negative perception spillover effects to competitors in the context of brand scandals. Therefore, the direction and magnitude of the impact of Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings on consumer demand for competitors is an empirical question.</p><p>In this article, we investigate the temporally local effect of Chapter 11 filing on demand (i.e., quantity sold) for rival firms by analyzing Chrysler's Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. auto industry. On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is the first bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. carmaker in modern times and the 10th largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We collect a comprehensive and unique data set at the dealer-model-day level to compare changes in unit sales for the rivals of Chrysler before and after its bankruptcy filing. A challenge to measuring the impact of bankruptcies is the coincident decline in economic conditions in the United States stemming from the Great Recession. To separately identify the bankruptcy effect from the recession effect, our analysis uses a regression-discontinuity-in-time (RDiT) design based on a temporal discontinuity in treatment (i.e., bankruptcy filing), along with an extensive set of control <ref type="bibr">Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 296-316, © 2019 INFORMS</ref> variables (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson 2017</ref> for the details and checklist for the RDiT framework). This approach uses a car model's own unit sales just before the bankruptcy filing as the counterfactual unit sales just after bankruptcy in the absence of the bankruptcy filing, after taking into account other observables such as dealer characteristics and seasonality. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Our subsequent analyses of potential confounding factors such as prices, advertising, and recalls show no substantial change around the bankruptcy filing in general. Another difficulty in identifying the demand effect of Chrysler's bankruptcy is the potential effect of the "cash for clunkers" program-a U.S. federal scrappage program that officially started on July 27, 2009. Specifically, if consumers hold back in anticipation of the program, this may result in a reduction in demand in the period after the Chrysler bankruptcy. Although our RDiT design helps us deal with this issue as well, we also include detailed controls associated with the scrappage program. Additionally, we examine the sales patterns of Chrysler's competitors in Canada-where Chrysler did not file for bankruptcy-around Chrysler's filing to complement our RDiT approach. Furthermore, we report statistics regarding consumer spending on other durable categories and big-ticket items (e.g., houses, motorcycles, etc.) around the filing as well as measures of consumer confidence. These statistics suggest that macroeconomic conditions are largely stable in the proximal temporal vicinity of Chrysler's bankruptcy.</p><p>We find that, on average, unit sales for a competitor decrease by 28% in response to Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. This finding suggests that the contagion effect in terms of sales dominates the competitive effect in our context. What this implies for managers and policymakers is that the financial distress experienced by a firm could in fact have harmful short-term demand effects for its rivals in the same industry. The negative demand spillover effect is broadly consistent across an extensive set of checks documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Lemieux (2010)</ref>, among others. Specifically, our finding is robust to (1) different estimation strategies recommended for RDiT settings, (2) different functional forms, (3) different estimation windows around the bankruptcy filing, (4) the inclusion of several important controls (i.e., "cash for clunkers," incentives, advertising, inventory, recalls, price, and consumer confidence), (5) the donut regression discontinuity approach, (6) a potential serial correlation issue, (7) a falsification exercise, and (8) the inclusion of differential trends at various levels.</p><p>We then explore possible mechanisms for the negative demand spillover such as increased consumer uncertainty about car purchases, decreased cross-traffic from the bankrupt firm's dealers to competitors' dealers, and lower consumer attitude toward the competitors sharing the same country of origin with the bankrupt firm, among others. We find several types of support for the increased consumer uncertainty explanation. First, we provide anecdotal evidence revealing that the news coverage about the bankruptcy not only emphasized the financial distress of the bankrupt firm but also highlighted the widespread auto industry crisis. Second, we show that the sales of competitors' vehicles that are more vulnerable to the uncertainty are affected more negatively following the bankruptcy filing. Specifically, the negative spillover effect is larger for competitors' models that are in the same segments as the bankrupt firm's models and that all competitor brands face sales declines following Chrysler's bankruptcy after taking the cross-segment heterogeneity into account. Additionally, we argue that car models with lower "equity" are more vulnerable to a negative demand spillover, as brands as market signals reduce consumer uncertainty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Erdem and Swait 1998)</ref>. Using "overall quality divided by manufacturer suggested retail price" as a proxy for the "perceived quality" measure of equity 3 at the carmodel level, we provide evidence that competitors' car models that offer better value for money stand to lose less due to the Chrysler filing. Third, in line with the heightened consumer uncertainty about automobile purchases, we demonstrate that the web search activity associated with the search terms including the brands of Chrysler's competitors increases significantly after Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that the source of consumer uncertainty is the uncertainty about the viability of the bankrupt firm's rivals rather than the uncertainty about competitors' future discounts or availability of spare parts.</p><p>This study contributes to the literature on the effect of bankruptcy on market outcomes in two ways. First, unlike prior research that has mainly examined the stock price response of competitors to bankruptcies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lang and Stulz 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Cheng and McDonald 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Ferris et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Haensly et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Akhigbe et al. 2005</ref>, we show the existence of a negative spillover effect in terms of consumer demand. Importantly, our negative demand spillover finding implies that comparisons of bankrupt firms' performances with those of nonbankrupt firms to assess the efficiency of Chapter 11 bankruptcies and indirect costs (e.g., as in Aivazian and Zhou 2012) might be misleading because a nonbankrupt firm does not necessarily mean a "control" firm. Second, our product-level analysis allows us to show that the bankruptcy filing has a heterogeneous impact across the products of a given competitor. Previous research cannot speak to such heterogeneous effects because the researchers conduct firm-level analyses to study stock-price responses.</p><p>This paper also adds to prior empirical research on spillover effects. Most studies in this literature concentrate on spillover effects in response to potentially positive events (e.g., new product introduction). These Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 papers show the existence of spillover effects within a brand family in a given category <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balachander and Ghose 2003)</ref>, within a brand family across categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Erdem and Sun 2002)</ref>, and within a given category across competing brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Janakiraman et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Shapiro 2018</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freedman et al. (2012)</ref> complement these studies by providing evidence of spillover effects in response to a negative event (i.e., toy recalls) within a given category across competing manufacturers. In a similar vein, Borah and Tellis (2016) concentrate on automobile recalls and find that negative online chatter about a car model raises negative chatter for another model. Using aggregate data at the nameplate-month level, they estimate a panel vector autoregressive model and show that a rise in concerns about a nameplate's nearest competitor reduces the focal nameplate's sales. We extend these studies by (1) documenting a spillover effect within a given category across competing firms in response to a new type of negative event (namely, Chapter 11 bankruptcy) and (2) providing evidence of two significant moderators of the negative spillover effect: (a) the segment overlap between the bankrupt firm's models and competing firms' models and (b) the level of value for money provided by competitors' car models. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borah and Tellis (2016)</ref>, we do not find that negative spillover effects are more likely to manifest for car models that share the same country of origin as that of the firm experiencing the negative event. In addition to the aforementioned substantive contributions, this study also adds to the marketing literature methodologically by applying the RDiT approach to examine potential spillover effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman and Rapson 2017)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</head><p>Chapter 11, named after the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 11, is a form of bankruptcy that provides protection to financially distressed debtors (usually a corporation or partnership). Given its complexity and costs, Chapter 11 bankruptcy is mostly preferred by large firms. It affords the bankrupt firm a number of mechanisms to restructure its business so that it can continue operation and emerge from the bankruptcy as a financially healthier firm with less debt. These mechanisms involve debt and capital restructuring, supply and labor contract negotiation, and product-line consolidation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Auto Industry Crisis and Chrysler's Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</head><p>The automotive industry is an important pillar of the U.S. economy. The "Detroit-Three"-i.e., GM, Ford, and Chrysler-alone employ 880,000 workers (6.6% of the U.S. manufacturing workforce) and contribute approximately 3.6%, or $500 billion, to the total gross domestic product output. In the United States, transactions at automobile dealerships account for a staggering 19% of all retail sales-making it the largest single retail sector and outpacing general-merchandise stores, food and beverage stores, and even gas stations. Given its economic importance and rich institutional features, researchers in marketing have concentrated on the automobile industry to address important issues related to pricing as well as consumer and trade promotions, among others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sudhir 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Albuquerque and Bronnenberg 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Ozturk et al. 2016</ref>.</p><p>The global recession that started in 2008 sent shock waves through every sector of the economy. The economic meltdown arguably had the swiftest and most disastrous effect on the auto industry, which lost 50% of its sales volume in a single year and slashed 400,000 jobs. The crisis forced auto manufacturers and government regulators to make decisions in real time about how to keep the industry competitive. The unique restrictions that government had placed on this industry hampered its ability to quickly adjust to new marketplace realities. For example, union contracts prevented car manufacturers from closing down factories, and state franchise laws prevented them from closing down dealerships. The only way out was bankruptcy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lafontaine and Morton 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Following the recommendations from the U.S. Treasury Department, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection-the 10th largest in the U.S. history-on April 30, 2009. Chrysler reemerged as a new entity, "new Chrysler," on June 10, 2009 after the bankruptcy protection period. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> With this unprecedented bankruptcy filing by a major U.S. carmaker in modern times as our backdrop, in the following sections we study the immediate impact of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy on the unit sales of the bankrupt firm's competitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data and Temporal Patterns Around</head><p>Chrysler's Bankruptcy ) of the vehicle. We exclude "exotic/limited" segments such as prestige sporty and cargo minivan from our analysis. In addition to data on car characteristics, we observe information about dealer characteristics, including the dealer's name and address.</p><p>To control for market-level shocks, such as changes in the number of dealers, that may affect vehicle sales, we need to base our analysis on a clear market definition. We follow a similar approach to previous studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Olivares and Cachon (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Orhun et al. (2016)</ref> to define a geographically isolated market. Specifically, we concentrate on urbanized areas or urban clusters with a population of fewer than 150,000 that have a minimum distance of 30 miles to markets of equal or larger size. To avoid the confounding sales effects of bankruptcy-induced dealer exits, along with other potential dealer entries or exits, we also eliminate markets with any entry or exit in 2009. Although excluding markets with market structure changes leads to a reduction in geographic variation, it allows for a clean analysis of the impact of Chapter 11 bankruptcy based on rich temporal variation in unit sales before and after the Chrysler filing. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Because the top seven manufacturers-Chrysler, GM, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and Hyundaiaccount for around 98% of total sales in these isolated markets, we restrict our analysis to the top-six rivals of Chrysler. Because we wish to estimate a model with dealer and car fixed effects to control for many factors that drive the sales of a car, we drop any models that have fewer than a total of 100 sales across all markets. We then exclude any dealer-model combination with fewer than three sales over the entire data period. This leaves us a sample of 369 isolated markets with 850 dealers (defined as a unique combination of dealer name and address). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The resulting sample still contains more than 92% of all original sales in our sample markets. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides a summary of our dependent and control variables (discussed later) based on our final sample. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Other Data Sources</head><p>We supplement our primary data set with additional data sources to explore potential drivers of manufacturer sales in the United States. To evaluate the broader macroeconomic conditions around Chrysler's bankruptcy filing, we collect data on household-level expenditures for categories related to vehicles and major household items from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). We use CEX files for 2009 to tabulate expenditures for various categories based on two samples. The first sample contains all consumer units interviewed. For the second sample, we generate a subsample from the list of all consumer units by selecting the consumer units that reside in markets similar to those in our sales data. This subsample is restricted to (1) the states covered by our estimation sample, (2) urban areas, and (3) primary sampling units with a population size smaller than 329,000.</p><p>We also collect data on the demographic characteristics of the local markets included in our analysis from the SimplyMap database (http://geographicresearch.com/ simplymap) to assess local economic conditions. This database includes annual information on demographic variables such as median household income, median house value, and percentage of employed population at various geographic levels such as Zip code and city.</p><p>To assess any potential trends in consumer preferences, we acquire very detailed car characteristics data from Chrome, an automotive syndicated data provider. The data set provides information on a wide range of car characteristics available at a fine VIN level, which we use to analyze potential trends in consumer preferences. Specifically, we concentrate on product characteristics such as engine size, number of cylinders, Notes. Reported statistics are from the largest symmetric (32-week) window around Chrysler's filing that we use for our estimations (excluding two bankruptcy filing days; i.e., April 30 and June 1). The statistics for financing rates are calculated using 1,393,490 observations based on model-day combinations for which there is a financing rate promotion. The statistics for the price variable are calculated using 553,364 observations. All other variables are calculated using 1,497,668 observations.</p><p>Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 fuel type, and manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP). We complement these data on car characteristics by collecting information on the overall quality of car models from J.D. Power. Data on incentives, inventory, and monthly Canadian and U.S. car sales come from Autonews.com. Incentives data include the dates and details of customer and dealer promotions such as consumer cash, dealer cash, and financing rate promotions for each makemodel-model year combination. Inventory data are at the national level and show the unit count of vehicles on hand for each car model at dealerships, factory lots, ports of entry, and in transit at the beginning of each month. These data allow us to adjust for potential supply effects while analyzing the sales effect of the bankruptcy filing. The Canada and U.S. unit sales data contain monthly national sales at the manufacturermodel level. Note that, in our main analysis, we use daily unit sales data for the United States at the dealer-model level based on the R. L. Polk data. We use the national unit sales data for the United States from Autonews.com to assess monthly seasonality in the years prior to our analysis period, which are not available in the R. L. Polk data.</p><p>To complement the incentive data, we also obtain daily advertising spending data at the designated market area (DMA) level and at the national level that include observations for each manufacturer-make combination from Kantar Media. This data set allows us to evaluate and account for total advertising expenditures (national and local) for the automakers around the Chrysler filing. Similarly, to assess changes in prices before and after bankruptcies, and check the robustness of results to the inclusion of price as a control variable, we obtain two data sets. One of them is from Experian, and it includes transaction prices for the census of all personal purchases across 19 states. Because our sales data cover all states, we have transaction price data for only a subset of our sales observations. The other data set is provided by a major marketing research firm. It contains monthly retail prices at the dealer-VIN level for a subsample of our sales observations. We rely on the Office of Defect Investigation's database of automobile recalls to measure the level of recall activity for automakers. This database provides information on the number of recalled units by manufacturer, make, model, and model year as well as the date and other details associated with each recall. Using these data, we create the cumulative number of units recalled for a given manufacturer since the beginning of 2009.</p><p>We also use data on macroeconomic indicators for the United States and Canada from OECD (stats.oecd .org) and the World Bank (databank.worldbank.org). These indicators provide information on variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment, and consumer price index. Furthermore, we collect data on three consumer confidence measures: the Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index, the University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment index, and the ABC News's weekly consumer comfort index. These measures allow us to assess the varying levels of consumer confidence around the bankruptcy filing.</p><p>Finally, to explore potential mechanisms behind our main effect, we rely on the LexisNexis and Google Trends (trends.google.com/trends) databases. Using the LexisNexis database, we extract data on newspaper articles about the auto industry published in the United States during the bankruptcy period to obtain anecdotal evidence regarding the bankruptcy. The Google Trends database allows us to measure web search activity related to the competitors of Chrysler around its bankruptcy filing. Specifically, we obtain daily interest (web search) in the United States for the following search terms using a 60-day window around Chrysler filing: Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, General Motors (GM), and Hyundai Motor Company. The interest measure represents search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for a given search term. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the search term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for the search term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Rival Sales Around Chrysler's Bankruptcy</head><p>As our objective is to explore the effect of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing on the unit sales of its rivals, we first examine whether there are differences in competitor unit sales right before and after the bankruptcy filing. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> reports the total weekly unit sales of Chrysler's rivals just weeks before and after Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. The table shows that the unit sales of Chrysler's competitors were 16% lower in the threeweek window following its bankruptcy relative to the three-week window before the bankruptcy. The reduction in sales is even more pronounced based on shorter windows (one week or two weeks) before and after the Chrysler filing. Note that all these time windows around Chrysler filing are before GM filing. We obtain similar changes when we adjust for the day-ofweek effects by comparing the same days in the before and after periods.</p><p>To see whether these reductions could simply be seasonal, we use monthly U.S. sales data for the years prior to the recession. Since the data are available starting from 2004, we use four years of data <ref type="bibr">(i.e., 2004-2007)</ref>. As Chrysler declared bankruptcy on April 30, we calculate the average percentage change in unit sales between April and May across these four years to check if seasonality could explain the sales drop after Chrysler filing. The average percentage change in unit sales for Chrysler's competitors is a statistically insignificant increase of <ref type="bibr">Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 296-316, © 2019 INFORMS</ref> 9.3% (p = 0.16), between April and May. Therefore, we do not find evidence of substantial seasonality in the years prior to the recession that can explain the reduction in sales for Chrysler's rivals we observe around Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Although it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these patterns based on raw data, they indicate that Chrysler's filing may have had a significant negative effect on its rivals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Spending in Other Related Categories Around</head><p>Chrysler's Bankruptcy One might argue that the broader macroeconomic environment might underlie the downward sales pattern we observe for Chrysler's rivals after its bankruptcy filing. To check this possibility, we see whether the reduction in spending in the car category extended to other related categories of spending. To do so, using CEX data that contain monthly household-level expenditure information for 2009, we investigate the changes in consumer spending around Chrysler's bankruptcy in various categories including "other vehicles," "furnishings and appliances," as well as "audio and visual equipment." The category "other vehicles" consists of the items in "other vehicles" (OTHVEHCL) that include vehicles other than cars and trucks such as motorcycles. The category "furnishings and appliances" consists of spending data on "major appliances" (MAJAPPL; e.g., washing machine), "small appliances" (SMLLAPPL; e.g., portable heating and cooling equipment), and "furniture" (FURNITUR; e.g., sofas). Finally, the "audio and visual equipment" category contains "audio and visual equipment" (TVAUDIO; e.g., TVs). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents average monthly household expenditures for the above categories. Columns (2) an (3) report tabulations for all consumer units in 2009 CEX files. Columns (4) an ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) provide statistics associated with the closest subsample to our estimation sample as discussed in Section 3.2. The average household expenditure numbers for the sample with all consumer units indicate that spending was somewhat higher or similar in the months following the bankruptcy filing relative to those preceding the filing. We also formally tested the differences in average expenditures between April and May for all categories using paired t-tests, and we found no statistically significant difference. As columns (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, these patterns remain broadly consistent when we use the closest subsample to our estimation sample. 10 Taken together, our analysis of naturally occurring macro trends suggests that the reduction in competitors' car sales right after the Chrysler filing might not be driven by worsening macroeconomic conditions that would have possibly affected other vehicle categories, durable products, and big-ticket items.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Empirical Strategy</head><p>In this section, our goal is to formally evaluate the effect of Chrysler's Chapter 11 filing on the unit sales of its rivals. The key issue in doing so is to find an appropriate counterfactual sales level in the absence of the bankruptcy filing against which to compare the  <ref type="formula">1</ref>) computing the percentage change in the total number of sales for a given day of week (e.g., Monday) in the after period relative to the before period, and</p><p>(2) taking the average of these percentage differences across seven days of week.</p><p>Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 unit sales level after the bankruptcy filing. We use a regression-discontinuity-in-time (RDiT) approach based on a temporal discontinuity in treatment (i.e., Chrysler filing) to address this empirical problem. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The RDiT design is an approach to estimate treatment effects in nonexperimental settings where (1) the treatment is determined by a known cutoff time period (c) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) there is no cross-sectional variation in treatment status (i.e., a difference-in-differences approach is not applicable). <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The main idea behind this research design is that the observations for a unit (i ∈ N) just before the temporal cutoff (t &lt; c) are good counterfactuals for those just above the cutoff (t &gt; c). Thus, in theory, the RDiT design could use two sources of variation for identifying the treatment effect: time-series variation (asymptotics in T) and cross-sectional variation (asymptotics in N). If the researcher uses many units (i.e., large N) and a narrow time window around the treatment for identification, the RDiT design becomes closer to the canonical RD design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Lemieux 2010)</ref>. However, in practice, most RDiT applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davis 2008</ref>) examine contexts where data are available at a high temporal frequency (e.g., daily or hourly) over a long time period (e.g., years) with limited (or no) cross-sectional variation (e.g., N 1). Therefore, in RDiT settings, it is important to take into account additional challenges due to the use of time-series variation such as time-varying effects, autocorrelation, and manipulation of behavior near the cutoff, as documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>. In sum, an RDiT approach requires a comprehensive set of analyses validating the key identifying assumption, checking the robustness to various sources of identification and functionalform assumptions (e.g., flexible polynomial time trends), and eliminating potential biases due to the use of timeseries variation.</p><p>In our context, the RDiT approach estimates the counterfactual unit sales in the absence of the bankruptcy filing based on a narrow time window before the filing. In other words, after adjusting for other observable factors such as dealer fixed effects and seasonality, a car model's own unit sales just before the bankruptcy filing constitute a good comparison with those just after the bankruptcy filing. Then the average differences in unit sales between the pre-and posttime windows around the bankruptcy filing provide a consistent estimate of the average "treatment" effect of the Chrysler bankruptcy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hahn et al. 2001)</ref>. The identifying assumption of this approach is that there are no concomitant unobservable factors affecting demand that discontinuously change at the temporal cutoff. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> To implement the RDiT approach, we employ two different strategies. Because our dependent variable (i.e., quantity sold) is a count variable that takes on the value of zero frequently, we obtain our main results using a fixed-effects Poisson model similar to previous marketing studies with a count dependent variable in an RDiT context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Busse et al. 2010)</ref>. We then present results from the augmented local linear strategy proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Effect of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on</head><p>Competitors' Unit Sales Because our aim is to estimate the impact of Chrysler's bankruptcy on the quantity sold by competitors, we first compute our dependent variable-i.e., unit sales for each dealer(d)-model(m)-day(t) combination (e.g., Tuscaloosa Toyota-Toyota Camry-May 1, 2009). Given that unit sales is a count measure, we employ a fixedeffects Poisson model with cluster (dealer) robust standard errors. The use of a fixed-effects (conditional on dealer) Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood model with clustered standard errors ensures (1) that the estimator is consistent even if there exists under-or overdispersion in the latent variable specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cameron and Trivedi 2005)</ref> and (2) that we address the issue of serial dependence in residuals (because arbitrary correlation Columns ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) an ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) report statistics associated with the closest subsample to our estimation sample. This subsample was obtained from the list of all consumer units by selecting the consumer units that reside in (1) the states covered by our estimation sample, (2) an urban area (i.e., BLS_URBAN = 1), and (3) a Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) with a population size smaller than 329,900 (i.e., POPSIZE = 4 or 5). Note that expenditure levels, especially for vehicles excluding cars and trucks, appear to be low. The reason for this is that not all consumer units purchase an item during the survey period. The less frequently an item is purchased, the larger the difference between the average for all consumer units and the average for those purchasing the item.</p><p>Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 296-316, © 2019</ref> across time within dealers is allowed for), as has been the norm in the RDiT literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman and Rapson 2017)</ref>.</p><p>More precisely, we estimate a Poisson regression model with the following log-link specification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log(UnitSales dmt ) β ChryComp Chry Filing t + f (t) + δ d + µ m + τ T + β x X dmt + dmt . (1)</formula><p>The dummy variable Chry Filing t is equal to 1 after Chrysler's bankruptcy filing, and 0 otherwise. The flexible global polynomial daily time trend f (t) allows for separate trends on either side of the bankruptcy filing date. In our analyses, we run estimations incorporating firstthrough fourth-order polynomials and choose the polynomial order based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman and Rapson 2017)</ref>. We include this flexible polynomial to control for unobserved factors that change smoothly over time. The vector of dealer fixed effects, δ d , accounts for dealer-specific characteristics such as the location and size of the dealership as well as the demographic composition and the level of competition at the dealer's local market (as we consider markets without any entry or exit during the analysis period). The vector of model fixed effects, µ m , controls for time-invariant model characteristics such as manufacturer (e.g., GM), brand (e.g., Chevrolet), and nameplate (e.g., Impala). To adjust for time-varying demand conditions common to all car models such as gas prices and seasonality at various levels of aggregation, we also include several time-varying fixed effects-namely, τ T . These fixed effects consist of day of month, day of week, the last five days of the month, and quarter fixed effects.</p><p>The vector of time, dealer, and/or model varying control variables is denoted by X dmt . This vector includes controls for incentives (cash and financing rate), advertising, inventory, recalls, and consumer comfort. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> It is important to take these factors into consideration because potential changes in them around Chrysler's bankruptcy filing may confound our estimate for the effect of bankruptcy filing on competitor sales. The vector X dmt also includes control variables that account for other important events that happened in our study period and that may have differential effects on manufacturers. These variables consist of the interaction of manufacturer dummies with the indicator variable for periods after Chrysler's emergence from bankruptcy (manufacturer × Chrysler emergence), the interaction of manufacturer dummies with the indicator variable for periods after GM's bankruptcy filing (manufacturer × GM filing), and the interaction of manufacturer dummies with the indicator variable for periods after GM's emergence from bankruptcy (manufacturer × GM emergence). We also take into account different periods associated with the "cash for clunkers" program. Specifically, we include the interaction of manufacturer dummies with the "cash for clunkers" dummy variable, which is equal to 1 starting from the official start date of the program (i.e., July 27). In addition, to account for the possibility that sales might have started to decrease in anticipation of the program even before the official launch, we add detailed controls for important periods related to the program. On June 24, the president signed the program into law. The transactions associated with the program became potentially eligible on July 1, but the final rule was not issued and the processing of claims did not begin until July 24. The program ended on August 25. Based on these event dates, we create three dummy variables associated with the following periods: June 24 to June 30; July 1 to July 24, and July 25 to August 25. We then include the interactions of these three dummy variables with manufacturer dummies in our main specification as well.</p><p>The key coefficient of interest in our main specification in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is β ChryComp . This coefficient shows the multiplicative effect of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing on the average number of unit sales across its competitors. For example, if β ChryComp is smaller than zero (in the case of a negative bankruptcy effect), the average unit sales for Chrysler's competitors after Chrysler's bankruptcy is exp(β ChryComp ) times the average unit sales before the bankruptcy. Equivalently, the average unit sales for Chrysler's rivals decreases by 100 × [1exp(β ChryComp )]% after Chrysler's bankruptcy.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> presents the coefficient estimates based on the Poisson regression model in Equation (1) using three different symmetric windows around Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Column (1) shows the estimated impact of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing on competitors' unit sales using 14 weeks of observations on either side of the filing date. The coefficient estimate for the effect of Chrysler filing on the mean unit sales of competitors implies that the filing is associated with an average of 28% [1exp(-0.330)] reduction in rivals' unit sales. As shown in columns (2) and (3), we continue to find a significant reduction in competitor sales when we use longer symmetric windows around Chrysler's filing. In addition, control variables have expected signs across all three estimations (not reported due to space constraints). Although incentives (cash and financing rate promotion availability), advertising, starting inventory, and consumer comfort are positively related to the unit sales of competitors, recalls are negatively associated with competitor sales. 15 4.2.1. Robustness to Other Functional Forms. We begin our sensitivity analyses by checking the robustness of our finding to other functional form specifications. First, we estimate new specifications with different orders of polynomial as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Lemieux (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>. Given the issues raised by Gelman and Imbens (2017) about using Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 high-order polynomials in RD designs, we concentrate on low-order polynomials. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows that our finding of a reduction in competitor sales in response to Chrysler's bankruptcy filing is robust to different orders for the polynomial time trend.</p><p>Second, our main specification in Equation (1) consists of a Poisson model with a log-link to model the unit sales as a function of the key independent and control variables. To assess the sensitivity of our results to the overdispersion of unit sales data, we reestimate our model using the negative binomial distribution instead of Poisson. The results for this estimation are reported in the last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. The coefficient for the focal bankruptcy variable shows that the rivals of the bankrupt firm stand to lose sales after the bankruptcy filing. This finding is in line with the fact that our original estimator, which only requires a conditional mean assumption, is consistent under general conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Robustness to the Augmented Local Linear</head><p>Strategy. We complement our analysis above based on the global strategy by conducting the augmented local linear strategy proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>. The augmented local linear strategy is composed of two steps: (1) save the residuals after estimating the coefficients of control variables (e.g., seasonality) using a large window (e.g., 32 weeks) around the treatment, and  (2) estimate a local linear specification using just the residuals within a narrow window around the treatment (e.g., 30 days on either side of the treatment). Following the recommendation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Lemieux (2010)</ref> and the approach in Hausman and Rapson ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>), in the top-left part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we depict the residuals from our outcome variable (i.e., unit sales) based on a two-step augmented local linear approach using 30 days of observations on either side of the bankruptcy filing.</p><p>This graph shows a noticeable decline in unit sales Notes. These figures show the regression-discontinuity-in-time plots for the unit sales residuals as well as for several control variables using 30 days of observations for Chrysler's competitors on either side of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing and a bin width of two days with rectangular kernel. The plot for unit sales residuals are based on the two-step augmented local linear approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 residuals around the filing date. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We provide the formal estimates based on the augmented local linear strategy in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. This table shows estimates for bandwidths of 30, 60, and 90 days around the filing date with rectangular, triangular, and Epanechikov kernels. The results continue to indicate that the bankrupt firm's competitors lose sales after the bankruptcy filing, providing further support for our original finding of negative demand spillover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Potential Anticipatory Behavior and Robustness</head><p>to Donut RD. One concern about our analyses so far is that the competitors of Chrysler may have anticipated its bankruptcy and acted in response. This concern about anticipatory behavior near the cutoff is especially relevant when time is the running variable in an RD setting and when competitors can precisely anticipate the discontinuity and have clear expectations about the potential impact of the bankruptcy to act accordingly. This is possibly not the case in our context for several reasons. First, Chrysler's way out of financial distress was determined by a multiparty negotiation-that began in March 2009-among Chrysler, the United Auto Workers (UAW), Fiat, and the government of Canada. Bankruptcy was not the only option on the table, and Chrysler was not the only decision maker. The "furious nonstop negotiations" among the parties "did not end until shortly before Chrysler's Chapter 11 filing" <ref type="bibr">(Selbst 2009, p. 4</ref>). As a result, it was difficult for Chrysler's competitors to precisely anticipate the date of the bankruptcy filing. Second, Chrysler's bankruptcy was the first corporate bankruptcy in the auto manufacturing industry in modern times. Therefore, competitors might have not had unambiguous predictions about the potential implications of the filing, and thus they might have adopted a "wait-and-see" policy. In line with these reasons, data trends in the close temporal vicinity of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing suggest that the majority of the variables under Chrysler's competitors' control remain stable around the filing date (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr">17</ref> To further address the potential anticipatory behavior concern, following the recommendation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>, we assess the sensitivity of our results to observations close to the filing date. Specifically, we estimate three additional augmented local linear estimations using 30 days of observations on either side of the cutoff by removing (1) one week from center, (2) one week from the prefiling period, and (3) one week from the postfiling period (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barreca et al. 2011</ref> for a similar approach). In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, consistent with our previous results, we find evidence of a demand decline for Chrysler's competitors after Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. 18 4.2.4. Potential Serial Correlation in Unit Sales. In an RDiT context, it is important to take into account the timeseries properties of the data as well. Accordingly, following the suggestion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>, we test for the presence of autocorrelation in the outcome variable of interest-i.e., unit sales-using preintervention data. Our data could not reject the null hypothesis that  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref>. This table reports the coefficient (bootstrapped standard error) of the Chrysler filing dummy from 9 separate augmented local linear regressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman and Rapson 2017)</ref>. In columns ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), (2), and (3), the treatment effects are estimated with 30, 60, and 90 days of observations on either side of the cutoff, respectively. These three windows contain 402,960, 799,204, and 1,202,164 observations, respectively. Our qualitative finding remains robust when we use the bandwidth based on an integrated mean square error (i.e., 24.6 days), however the estimates become less precise due to using a short window around the filing. ***p &lt; 0.01. there is no autocorrelation (p-value = 0.708). As an additional check, we include the lagged unit sales as a regressor in our augmented local linear estimation (not reported). We found that our negative spillover finding is robust, in line with the autocorrelation test result.</p><p>4.2.5. Time-Varying Effects. We also consider potentially time-varying effect of Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Given that GM declared bankruptcy one month after Chrysler, we concentrate on the four-week period after the Chrysler filing to see whether the negative demand spillover effect is persistent. In doing so, we include five additional variables to our main specification in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). Specifically, we add the PrePost Chrysler filing dummy that takes value 1 if an observation occurs within the four-week pre-or postperiod around the Chrysler filing as well as the interactions of the pre/post Chrysler filing dummy with four dummy variables that indicate one week, two weeks, three weeks, and four weeks after the Chrysler filing. As a result, the coefficients associated with the interactions show the change in demand in a given week after the filing relative to the four-week period before Chrysler filing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Busse et al. 2010</ref> for a similar approach). The estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> suggest that the negative demand spillover persists over the four-week period following Chrysler's bankruptcy. 19</p><p>4.2.6. Other Robustness Checks. We conduct additional robustness checks related to remaining, if any, time-varying omitted variables in Online Appendix C. These sensitivity analyses, including a "falsification" test along with robustness to differential trends at various levels, indicate that it is unlikely that the reduction in unit sales for Chrysler's rivals after the bankruptcy is driven by concurrent unobserved factors that are not taken into account in our specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Car Sales in Canada Around</head><p>Chrysler's Bankruptcy In our estimations so far, we have used a car model's own unit sales just before Chrysler's filing as the counterfactual for those just after the bankruptcy filing, after controlling for other factors. Another approach for addressing the issue of time-varying omitted variables is to find a "control" group and compare the changes in unit sales that we observe for our "treatment" group around the Chrysler bankruptcy to those from the "control" group. As Chrysler's bankruptcy occurred in the United States, all markets in the United States fall into the "treatment" group. This means that we need another market that is similar to the U.S. market but that is not "treated" by a bankruptcy filing. Because Chrysler Canada did not file for bankruptcy in Canada, consumers in Canada did not face the same situation experienced by consumers in the United States due to Chrysler's bankruptcy in the United States. Thus, the Canadian market could serve as a control market. Ideally, if we had Canadian sales data at the same disaggregate level as our U.S. data (i.e., dealer-model-day), we could have estimated the impact of Chrysler's filing using a difference-in-difference approach as an additional robustness check. However, we only observe national monthly unit sales for Canada. As a result, we will informally investigate how Canadian sales evolved around the Chrysler bankruptcy in the United States. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref> reports unit sales for Chrysler's competitors in the months preceding and following the Chrysler's filing in the United States. The unit sales of Chrysler's competitors increase by 9.3% in Canada, where Chrysler did not declare bankruptcy. This finding is in contrast with the sales reduction that Chrysler's competitors faced in the United States. As a result, the depressed sales we observe for Chrysler's rivals in the United States may not simply be explained by a poor global macroeconomic environment and seasonal variation in automobile sales. The pattern in unit sales for the competitors of Chrysler in Canada gives more support to the view that Chrysler's bankruptcy filing may have negatively affected the competitors of the bankrupt firm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Possible Mechanisms</head><p>In the preceding section, we found that the competitors of the bankrupt firm experienced a significant reduction in unit sales in response to the Chapter 11 filing. This result implies that the contagion effect dominates the competitive effect when it comes to the consumer demand response for competitors, which is in line with the dominant contagion effect for the stock price reactions reported in the finance literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lang and Stulz 1992)</ref>. This section explores potential mechanisms for the negative demand spillover due to the bankruptcy. Specifically, we argue that the negative sales effect for the bankrupt firm's competitors is due to the increased consumer uncertainty about automobile purchases. We then provide suggestive evidence that the source of consumer uncertainty is the uncertainty about the viability of the bankrupt firm's competitors rather than the uncertainty about competitors' future discounts or availability of parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Increased Consumer Uncertainty Mechanism</head><p>Chapter 11 bankruptcy creates ambiguity about the bankrupt firm because its future becomes unclear.</p><p>When consumers encounter ambiguous information about the bankrupt firm's future promotions, products, and services (e.g., availability of future brands as well as nearby dealers for convenient maintenance and repairs), it will be harder for them to make judgments among a set of choices, leading to a state of choice uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Weick 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Cutcher-Gershenfeld et al. 2015</ref>. This, in turn, is likely to force consumers to reassess and revise current beliefs or assumptions not only about the products of the bankrupt firm but also about the purchasing environment in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shiu et al. 2011)</ref>, especially when their choices are irreversible for a long period of time. The increase in consumer uncertainty about the purchasing environment could be related to the viability of bankrupt firm's competitors, if consumers consider the possibility that the financial distress of the bankrupt firm reflects an industry-wide financial trouble <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Shleifer and Vishny 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Other potential sources of an increased consumer uncertainty might include the availability of price discounts and spare parts in the future. The increase in consumer uncertainty due to a bankruptcy filing will then heighten the value of waiting for consumers until the uncertainty about the future alternatives (including all product attributes such as brands, models, services, promotions, etc.) is resolved (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bernanke 1983</ref> for a similar reasoning for why a temporary uncertainty might reduce consumer spending). As such, consumers' search intention may increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shiu et al. 2011)</ref>, and they may delay decision making in the automobile category to search for more information before finalizing their choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In the following subsections, we provide four types of evidence that support an increased consumer uncertainty-driven negative spillover effect. First, we present anecdotal evidence suggesting that the news coverage about the bankruptcies emphasized the widespread auto industry crisis along with the financial distress of the bankrupt firms. Second, we show that the negative spillover effect is greater for competitors' models that are in the same segments as the bankrupt firm's models and that all competitor brands suffer due to the bankruptcy filing after controlling for the segment. Third, we demonstrate that competitors' car models that offer better value for money (i.e., overall quality divided by manufacturer suggested retail price) are affected less adversely by Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Fourth, we provide evidence that web search activity for Chrysler as well as Chrysler's competitors goes up significantly after Chrysler's bankruptcy filing in line with the heightened consumer uncertainty about car purchases. In particular, we show that while the web search activity for the "bankruptcy" search term for Chrysler's competitors increases after the filing, the web search activity for "discount" and "parts" search terms does not change significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Anecdotal Evidence for the Increased</head><p>Consumer Uncertainty Mechanism Although our previous analysis shows that overall consumer confidence in the economy cannot explain the sharp drop in rival sales, Chrysler's bankruptcy filing may have affected the confidence in purchasing decisions in the automobile industry. In other words, the negative demand spillover finding could be indicative of a lowered confidence among car buyers. According to this explanation, consumers should be aware of the Chrysler bankruptcy and should perceive  <ref type="bibr">Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 296-316, © 2019 INFORMS</ref> the bankruptcy as evidence of the widespread auto industry crisis. A Gallup Poll conducted June 9-10 suggests that 74% of Americans correctly identified Chrysler as having declared bankruptcy. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Additionally, in the Pew Research Center report on top news stories of 2009, the news story titled "U.S. Auto Industry Woes" during the bankruptcies period was listed as one of the top news stories where public interest exceeded coverage. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> To investigate the news media coverage of the two bankruptcies in detail, we examine the newspaper articles in the LexisNexis database between April 30 and July 9 ("during bankruptcies" period). More precisely, we search for articles published in the United States, and we use "automaker bankruptcies," "chapter 11," and "insolvency" as search terms and "automotive industry" as a filter. Our search resulted in 133 articles. We next calculate the percentage of articles that contain a specific keyword. Here is the list of keywords and the associated coverage percentage: debt 38%, industry 38%, automotive 25%, automakers 19%, Ford 17%, Toyota 11%, crisis 8%, and Nissan 7%. These statistics reveal that the news media coverage of the bankruptcies was not limited to the bankruptcy protection for Chrysler. In addition, the news coverage around debt and crisis in the industry might have resulted in heightened concerns about the auto industry. For example, one of the articles mentions a West Covina councilman who said, "We clearly are concerned, in general, about the auto business for all of our dealers." Similarly, another article talks about a Toyota dealership owner who said, "The shoppers aren't shopping. When the total industry is off 43%, they are not running over to Toyota, Honda and Nissan products. They are sitting on their hands." These individual comments are in line with the Gallup Poll that finds that "Americans are, for the most part, not currently shopping for new cars." Overall, the anecdotal evidence offers support for the idea that the negative demand spillover might be due to increased consumer uncertainty about automobile purchases in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Greater Negative Spillover for Models with</head><p>Segment Overlap with Bankrupt-Firm Models While deciding which car to buy, consumers are more likely to search among alternatives within a given segment (i.e., car type) than across different segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Albuquerque and Bronnenberg 2008)</ref>. Consumers will face more uncertainty due to a bankruptcy filing if the segment they consider includes the bankrupt firm's car models. Thus, the sales of competitors' car models that compete with the bankrupt firm's models in the same segment are expected to be more negatively affected by the bankruptcy-induced consumer uncertainty and the associated delay in decision making.</p><p>This prediction is also supported by the studies in the finance literature arguing that rivals that are similar to those of the bankrupt firms are better candidates for a dominant negative spillover effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ferris et al. 1997)</ref>. These studies hold that rival firms that have similar cash flow structures to that of the bankrupt firm might be more adversely affected by the bankruptcy compared with rival firms with dissimilar cash flow structures. For example, if the bankruptcy reveals negative information regarding cash flows from investing activities of the bankrupt firm, the rivals that have overlapping investment portfolios with the bankrupt firm are expected to experience similar problems. This, in turn, may result in stock price reductions for those rival firms. Just as investors take into account the uncertainty in future firm cash flows, automobile buyers consider the uncertainty in the future value of their car choice, since the purchase decision is irreversible for a long period of time for durables. If the negative sales effect of the bankruptcy on rivals is the result of increased consumer uncertainty due to negative bankruptcy information, then products of rivals that are perceived as more similar to those of the bankrupt firm should be affected more negatively by the bankruptcy filing.</p><p>We use our data to see whether the car models of competitors that serve the same segments (based on the definitions in the R. L. Polk database) as those of the bankrupt firm suffer more in response to the Chapter 11 filing. For instance, whereas Toyota Camry competes with Chrysler 300 in the "upper middle" segment, Toyota Tacoma does not face such competition from Chrysler in the "compact pickup" segment. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> To examine the heterogeneity based on segment overlap, we create the Chrysler segment overlap dummy, which is equal to 1 if the segment of a given car model is one of those served by the bankrupt firm (i.e., Chrysler) and 0 otherwise. For instance, given the information above, Chrysler segment overlap is equal to 1 for Toyota Camry, but it is equal to 0 for Toyota Tacoma. To evaluate increased consumer uncertainty mechanism based on segment similarity, we include Chrysler filing × Chrysler segment overlap in our main specification. The coefficient estimates for this specification are reported in column (1) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>. In line with the increased consumer uncertainty mechanism, the negative coefficient for Chrysler filing × Chrysler segment overlap indicates that the sales reduction for competitors' car models that compete with Chrysler models in the same segment is significantly more negative than those without competing Chrysler models. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> To further check the increased consumer uncertainty explanation, we see whether there is any crossbrand heterogeneity (e.g., Ford versus Toyota) after controlling for the segment (e.g., sport utility). If the mechanism is through increased uncertainty about the automobile purchases in general, we expect that all brands suffer to some extent after taking into account <ref type="bibr">Ozturk, Chintagunta, and Venkataraman: Consumer</ref> Response to Chapter 11 the segment. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> We test this prediction by interacting manufacturer brand dummies with the Chrysler filing dummy and controlling for the interactions between segment dummies with the Chrysler filing dummy (among other controls). The estimates in column (2) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref> indicate that all manufacturer brands, including the baseline brand (Ford), faced a decline in their unit sales after Chrysler's bankruptcy filing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Lower Negative Spillover for Models Offering</head><p>Better Value for Money Previous literature in finance suggests that firms with special strengths such as strong reputation or valuable trademarks (i.e., equity) are more "able to withstand the signaled industry-wide troubles" than are firms without such strengths <ref type="bibr">(Laux et al. 1998, p. 7</ref>). In addition, earlier studies in marketing indicate that brands as market signals enhance consumer perceptions about brand attribute levels and decrease consumer uncertainty and perceived risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Erdem and Swait 1998)</ref>. Because our analysis is at the model level rather than at the firm or brand level, we translate this reasoning to the car model level. In doing so, we rely on one of the measures of brand equity-namely, perceived qualitythat fall under the associations dimension in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aaker (1996)</ref>. We proxy the "perceived quality" measure of equity at the car-model level by calculating "overall quality/MSRP," based on J. D. Power's measure of overall quality. This variable measures whether the car model provides good quality for the money. The coefficient estimate for the interaction of this Model-level equity variable with the Chrysler filing dummy is reported in column (2) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>. The positive and statistically significant interaction estimate suggests that rivals' models that offer better quality for money are affected significantly less negatively by the filing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Greater Web Search for Competing Brands</head><p>After Chrysler Filing Earlier studies about the consequences of consumer uncertainty predict higher search intention in response to an increase in choice uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shiu et al. 2011)</ref>. Following this prediction, we collect additional data on web search activity using search terms associated with the bankrupt firm and the six rival manufacturers in our analysis. Specifically, we obtained daily interest (web search) in the United States for the following search terms via Google Trends (https://trends.google .com/trends) using a 60-day window around Chrysler filing: Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, General Motors, and Hyundai Motor Company.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">11</ref> presents the ordinary-least-squares (OLS) estimates for several specifications using daily interest by manufacturer brand as the dependent variable and the Chrysler filing dummy as the key independent variable. Column (1) shows that, on average, web search activity for automobile manufacturers increased significantly following Chrysler's filing relative to the prebankruptcy period. This finding supports the increased consumer uncertainty explanation for the negative demand spillover effect. However, because the analysis in column (1) includes the web search activity for the bankrupt firm itself (i.e., Chrysler) along with its competitors, one may argue that the increase in web search after the filing could be mainly driven by the heightened search for the bankrupt firm. We check this in column (2) by removing the bankrupt firm from our sample. The coefficient for the Chrysler filing dummy is still positive and statistically significant for this sample that includes only Chrysler's competitors. This indicates that search activity for competing brands went up significantly after the Chrysler filing. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> This general increased search activity is consistent with heightened consumer uncertainty (and the associated need to resolve this uncertainty) about automobile purchases following Chrysler's bankruptcy.</p><p>To sharpen the consumer uncertainty mechanism, we check if there is any evidence regarding the source of the uncertainty. In particular, we analyze the daily interest in three specific search terms: "bankruptcy," "discount," and "parts" for each manufacturer. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref> shows the OLS estimates by search term for all manufacturers and for Chrysler's competitors only.  The estimates suggest that the search activity involving the "bankruptcy" search term increases significantly for Chrysler's competitors following Chrysler's filing. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> However, the search activity related to the "discount" and "parts" search terms does not change significantly after the filing. These findings imply that the source of consumer uncertainty appears to be the uncertainty about the viability of Chrysler's rivals, rather than the uncertainty about future promotions or availability of parts.</p><p>5.6. Alternative Mechanisms 5.6.1. Cross-Traffic Effects. Another possible explanation for the negative spillover effect is that there might be a positive cross-elasticity between Chrysler visits and visits to other dealers. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> For instance, a customer searching for a Jeep Grand Cherokee in the sport-utility vehicle (SUV) segment might first go to a Chrysler dealer but then visit a GM dealer to look for a similar vehicle (e.g., Chevrolet TrailBlazer). If that is the case, the decreased Chrysler traffic might have led to a decreased cross-traffic to competitors' dealers, and thus to a negative demand spillover. To check whether this "cross-traffic effects" mechanism is operative, we create an indicator variable that equals one for competitors that have a Chrysler dealer in the same ZIP code. We then add the Chrysler filing × Same ZIP Chrysler competitor interaction in our model. If the "cross-traffic effects" mechanism is at work, we expect that competitors with nearby Chrysler dealers suffer more than those without-i.e., a significant negative coefficient for the interaction term. The results reported in column (2) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref> show a negative but insignificant coefficient for the Chrysler filing × Same ZIP Chrysler competitor interaction. Therefore, we do not find strong support for the "cross-traffic effects" mechanism.</p><p>5.6.2. Country-of-Origin Overlap. Previous literature has shown that consumers use country image as a summary construct while forming attitudes about brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Han 1989</ref>) and negative spillover effect (in terms of online chatter) is most prominent between brands of the same country <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borah and Tellis 2016</ref>). Chrysler's bankruptcy might have adversely affected consumers' beliefs about American automakers in general, which, in turn, may have resulted in a more negative attitude toward American brands. Therefore, one possible explanation for the heterogeneous sales effects of the bankruptcy filing on competitors reported so far is that rivals that have the same country of origin as the bankrupt firm are better candidates for a strong contagion effect. According to this explanation, rivals with the same country of origin as the bankrupt firm tend to compete in similar segments. Thus, the negative sales effect we find when there is a segment overlap with the bankrupt firm simply reflects the similarity between the bankrupt firm and its competitors in terms of country of origin. To address this issue, in column (3) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>, we control for Chrysler filing × Same country of origin. The coefficient estimate for this interaction is significant but in the opposite direction of the alternative mechanism discussed above. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Thus, we find no support for the country-of-origin mechanism for the negative demand spillover effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we empirically examine the immediate influence of a firm's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on the consumer demand for its competitors in the U.S. auto industry. We document the adverse effect of Chrysler's filing on its rivals' unit sales. Specifically, we find that unit sales for an average competitor goes down by 28% following Chrysler's filing. We interpret this result to suggest that the contagion effect for rivals dominates the competitive effect of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in terms of consumer demand. This negative demand spillover effect is robust to (1) different estimation strategies (global versus local), (2) different functional forms (various polynomial time trends as well as Poisson, negative binomial, and augmented local linear specifications), (3) different estimation bandwidths around the bankruptcy filing, (4) the inclusion of several important controls (i.e., "cash for clunkers," incentives, advertising, inventory, recalls, price, and consumer confidence), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) the donut regression discontinuity approach, (6) a potential serial correlation issue, (7) a falsification exercise, and (8) the inclusion of differential trends at various levels. Importantly, we also investigate the mechanism behind the negative demand spillover effect, and we provide a variety of analyses that support an explanation based on the increased consumer uncertainty about the viability of the bankrupt firm's competitors. While these substantive findings contribute to the streams of literature on the effect of bankruptcies on market outcomes and spillover effects, our application of the RDiT approach adds to the marketing literature that employs quasi-experimental methods. These findings have important implications for managers and policymakers. From the firms' perspective, our results show that not only the bankrupt firm is vulnerable to a negative reaction in consumer demand, but also its competitors. In addition, our findings suggest that some competitors-those that compete for similar segments as the bankrupt firm-are better candidates for a negative spillover effect. Moreover, within a competitor's product line, some products (e.g., those offer less value for money) might be more prone to a negative spillover effect than others. This is a novel insight as previous finance studies on the contagion effects of bankruptcies are based on a firm-level analysis as opposed to a product-level analysis. <ref type="bibr">Venkataraman: Consumer Response to Chapter 11 Marketing Science, 2019, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 296-316, © 2019 INFORMS</ref> Our results also inform policymakers as Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy under government supervision. Through the major automaker bankruptcies, the U.S. government aimed to avoid a potential collapse of the U.S. auto industry. On the one hand, our findings suggest unexpected negative demand consequences of bankruptcy filing for the competitors of the bankrupt firm. On the other hand, our results indicate, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that U.S. competitors might not necessarily be at a disadvantageous position compared with foreign competitors after Chrysler's bankruptcy. In our setting, it appears that the adverse effect of the bankruptcy on competitors is greater when there is segment overlap, but not when there is country-of-origin overlap.</p><p>Despite its contribution to the aforementioned literatures, our study has several limitations. Although we interpret our findings to suggest a negative demand spillover effect, "readers should evaluate the evidence as they would [in] any quasi-experimental paper" <ref type="bibr">(Hausman and Rapson 2017, p. 30</ref>). Our analysis relies on a government-supported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of one major manufacturer in a single sector. Note that GM also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy one month after Chrysler's filing. While we take into account the potential impact of GM's filing in measuring the effect of Chrysler filing on competitor demand, our focus in this paper is on Chrysler's filing. The reason for this is that GM's filing context is less conducive to a causal interpretation due to the increased potential for anticipation (as GM's filing follows that of Chrysler) and the existence of other events in the close temporal vicinity (e.g., Chrysler's emergence from bankruptcy). That said, we provide an additional analysis on the relationship between GM's filing and competitors' unit sales in Online Appendix C. In line with our previous negative spillover results, we find that the GM filing is associated with a 24% reduction in competitors' unit sales. However, given the aforementioned caveats, the reader should be especially cautious in interpreting this result as causal. We hope that future research will shed further light on the generalizability of our results by studying the impact of bankruptcy filings on firm sales in other industry settings. Furthermore, we do not observe the long-term sales of the manufacturers in our data set. More empirical research on the long-term effect of Chapter 11 bankruptcies on market outcomes would enhance our understanding. Finally, as we do not observe firm costs, our analysis cannot speak to the profitability implications of bankruptcy filings, which is another fruitful direction for future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Although we do not have daily data for the years preceding the bankruptcy to control for the same days for different years, our analysis in Section 3.3 shows that the average percentage change in unit sales for Chrysler's competitors is a statistically insignificant increase of 9.3% for the same months in the 2004-7 period. In line with this, Canadian data (discussed later) show that Chrysler's competitors increase their sales (9.25%) in Canada-where Chrysler did not declare bankruptcy-around Chrysler's filing in the United States. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Note that this measure is part of the 10 sets of measures of brand equity discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aaker (1996)</ref>. This aspect is different from other brand equity aspects such as the loyalty aspect, which is measured by "price premium" akin to the brand equity definition in <ref type="bibr">Keller (1993). 4</ref> The timeline for Chrysler's bankruptcy along with other major events, including GM's bankruptcy, is presented in Figure A.1 in Online Appendix A. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In 2009, around 90% of all new-car transactions (excluding leases) consists of business-to-consumer transactions. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> To evaluate the generalizability of our main finding (potentially at the expense of weaker identification), we also generated a random sample of urban areas and urban clusters across the United States. The analyses based on this random sample reported in Online Appendix A show that our finding is robust. A separate analysis only on the nonisolated urban markets (reported in Table A.5) shows a qualitatively similar negative spillover effect. 7 Figure A.2 in Online Appendix A provides a map of the resulting dealer locations. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We provide a comparison of unit sales between our final sample and the U.S. market for our analysis period in Online Appendix A. Chrysler, Ford, and GM have somewhat larger market shares in our sample compared with the U.S. market as shown in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.1. The higher market shares for the "Big Three" come at the expense of manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and BMW. These market share differences are expected as we concentrate on isolated markets where the demand for light trucks (e.g., F-series, Silverado, Ram, etc.) are higher relative to excluded markets as reported in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.2. 9 Detailed item lists for each category can be found at http://www.bls .gov/cex/pumd/2009/csxintstub.txt. 10 One could still claim that the negative macroeconomic situation might have a more adverse effect on big-ticket durables such as cars and houses than relatively inexpensive durables such as furnishings and appliances. To assess whether this is the case, we collected census data on monthly home sales in the United States. Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.1 in Online Appendix B reports thousands of houses sold in the United States and across four regions within the United States around the Chrysler bankruptcy. The national and regional sales numbers indicate, in line with monthly expenditure statistics for other categories, that home sales are similar after the bankruptcy filing compared with prebankruptcy months. When we test the mean difference in home sales across regions between April and May, we find an insignificant increase of 1,000 at the 5% significance level. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We thank an anonymous reviewer for bringing the paper of Hausman and Rapson (2017) to our attention.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hausman and Rapson (2017)</ref> provide a detailed comparison of the RDiT design with the canonical regression discontinuity (RD) design as well as other approaches such as the pre/post design, the interrupted time-series design, and event studies. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> A complementary way of generating counterfactual sales levels is to use sales levels from markets that are not affected by the bankruptcy filing. In our data, we observe daily sales from isolated geographic markets in the United States, which are all "treated" by the bankruptcy filing. Therefore, we need to find another market that is similar to our U.S. markets and that is not affected by the bankruptcy filing. Canada could be a good candidate, but we only have access to national sales at the monthly (as opposed to daily) level for Canada. Therefore, we are only able to informally examine how U.S. sales evolve compared with Canada sales in Section 4.3. Our informal analysis is in line with our formal RDiT analysis. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We do not include the other two measures of consumer confidencenamely, the consumer confidence index and the consumer sentiment index-because the other control variables and fixed effects in our specification explain 94% and 97% of the variation in those measures, respectively. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The marginal significance of advertising coefficients is due to the rich set of controls (including different incentives), the flexible global polynomial daily time trend, and the fixed effects to capture seasonality. Additionally, we left the price control out from our full model, because we lose many observations after adding it (as we observe prices only for a subsample). We show that our results do not change after adding price to our main specification in column (2) of Table <ref type="table">C</ref>.3 in Online Appendix C. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In Figure C.1 in Online Appendix C, we present RDiT graphs for the residuals from our outcome variable using different numbers of bins and bin sizes. These figures reveal a decline in unit sales around the filing date as well. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Although, there is somewhat of a reduction in the financing rate, we do not observe a discontinuous change around Chrysler's filing for the majority of these variables. Of additional note is that the effect of the change in financing rate around the filing, if any, would work in the opposite direction of finding a negative demand spillover effect. To complement this graphical analysis, we also explore the sensitivity of our findings to the inclusion of these covariates (as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee and Lemieux 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">C</ref>.3 in Online Appendix C shows that our findings are similar with and without these competitor marketing covariates. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> To complement the donut RD approach, we also followed the splitsample approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Card et al. (2008)</ref> using the fixedeffects threshold model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hansen 1999)</ref>. The identified break and the estimated effect are similar to those in our earlier analyses. We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting the split-sample approach. 19 A similar analysis using the augmented local linear strategy provides broadly consistent results except for the last week of the fourweek postbankruptcy period. In addition, note that the coefficients reported in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> are not directly comparable with the raw data on total unit sales in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> for two reasons. First, their calculations depend on different comparisons. More precisely, for example, while the two-week period before/after change reported in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> compares the combined unit sales within the two weeks after the filing (week 1 sales + week 2 sales) relative to the two weeks before the filing (week -1 sales + week -2 sales), the coefficient estimate for the "Pre/Post Chrysler filing × two weeks after filing" variable compares the counterfactual unit sales in the second week after the filing (week 2 sales) with that in the four-week prefiling period. Second, whereas the numbers in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> present model-free evidence for the negative demand spillover effect, the coefficients in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> are obtained after adjusting for many additional control variables that are not taken into account in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, especially the flexible polynomial time trend and day-of-month fixed effects. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> In Online Appendix D, we show that macroeconomic indicators and trends are comparable between the United States and Canada during our analysis period. 21 http://www.gallup.com/poll/120842/Disapprove-Majority -Government-Ownership.aspx?g_source=auto+industry &amp;g_medium =search&amp;g_campaign=tiles. 22 http://www.people-press.org/2009/12/29/top-stories-of-2009 -economy-obama-and-health-care. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Some other segments that are served by Chrysler in our analysis period include: "basic sporty" (Dodge Caliber), "full-size pickup" (Dodge Ram), and "sport utility" (Jeep Grand Cherokee). Other segments that are not served by Chrysler include segments such as "basic economy," "basic luxury," "lower middle," and "traditional large." <ref type="bibr">24</ref> We checked the robustness of the segment overlap result to unobserved cross-market differences by controlling for Chrysler filing × Market fixed effects interactions; the coefficient for the Chrysler filing × Chrysler segment overlap coefficient remained very similar. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> We thank the associate editor for suggesting this prediction. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> We also conducted estimations by each manufacturer separately but do not report them because of space constraints. These estimations reveal that the Chrysler filing coefficient is positive for all manufacturers, and it is statistically significant for five of the seven manufacturers. 27 This result is robust even if we drop GM from the sample of competitors. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> We thank the associate editor for suggesting this alternative mechanism. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> This result implies that although carmakers that share the same country of origin with the bankrupt manufacturer suffered from the filing, on average, they experienced a lower reduction in unit sales relative to the competitors with different countries of origin. This could be partially explained by the fact that Ford benefited from an improved public perception and enhanced consumer respect since it chose not to use a federal bailout to continue its business. A survey by AutoPacific reported that 72% of participants would be more likely to buy a Ford car because the company did not take government loans (https://www.cnbc.com/id/30134908).</p></div>			</div>
