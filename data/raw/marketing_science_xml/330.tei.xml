<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W e disentangle and study the relative importance of different risk preferences in explaining extended warranty purchases and the high premia paid for them. Empirical and behavioral research on insurance is at odds with whether diminishing returns (curvature of the utility function), or loss aversion and nonlinear probability weighting lead to observed consumer behavior. This lack of consensus is primarily due to the inability of standard choice data to separate different risk preferences, and the consequent need to rely on strong parametric assumptions. We design two conjoint studies (consistent with simultaneous and sequential decision making) with choices about washing machines and extended warranties, where subjects are given failure probabilities and repair costs. Using stated choice data from the surveys, we can nonparametrically identify product and risk preferences. We find that loss aversion is significantly more important than curvature and probability weights in explaining extended warranty choices. Importantly, failure to decompose risk-averse behavior into that arising from curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting leads to lower washer prices and profits. These findings are robust to alternate reference point assumptions. We rationalize the premia paid for warranties by exploring retailer incentives to price discriminate, and test the theory on complementary goods pricing. Finally, based on counterfactual analysis, forcing separate retailers to sell washers and extended warranties is not necessarily welfare enhancing as cited in the media and previous literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>To insure product purchases, consumers routinely pay over 100% markup for extended warranties (protection plans) and service contracts. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Understanding why consumers buy extended warranties and what drives them to pay high premia to insure against moderate risks has important implications for pricing and how warranties should be sold. In this paper, we disentangle and study the importance of different risk preferences in driving warranty choices. We use demand estimates to draw managerial implications for product and warranty pricing, shed light on retailers' pricing incentives when selling complementary goods such as products and extended warranties, and explore whether only independent retailers should sell extended warranties.</p><p>Unlike manufacturers' base warranties, which are bundled with the product, extended warranties are optional and consumers purchase them depending on their intrinsic preferences and expectations <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Henceforth, we will be using the terms "warranties" and "service contracts" interchangeably. If not mentioned otherwise, warranties refer to extended warranties. Any reference to base or manufacturer warranties will be explicit. about product quality. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Whereas consumers can buy extended warranties for a product purchased in the past, most extended warranties are purchased at the time of product purchase and thus we focus on such extended warranties. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> As per the trade publication Warranty Week, extended warranties worth $15 billion were sold in 2004 and the industry is growing at 7% per year, thus pointing to the importance and relevance of this industry.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, we report data on insurance prices and claims from previous research and a large midwestern home appliance retailer. Firms typically enjoy a contribution margin upward of 40% (67% markup) for home and auto insurance. Compared to an average contribution margin of 15% on home appliances 2 Unlike base warranties, extended warranties are additional stock keeping units (SKUs) that consumers can buy with products. Extended warranty contracts are underwritten and serviced either by the retailer or third-party insurers. For example, extended warranties sold at Best Buy are serviced by Geek Squad, whereas those sold at Circuit City are serviced by Bankers Warranty Group (BWG). The Home Depot and Lowe's have their own repair specialists. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Warranty <ref type="bibr">Week (2007)</ref>, "Extended warranty solution," July 25, 2007. and electronics, contribution margins on warranties (as cited in the popular press) are approximately 50%-60% (100%-150% markup), which is consistent with Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Researchers argue that these margins are driven by consumers' aversion to risk, which is operationalized by a concave utility function. Using data from the home appliance retailer, we calibrate the degree of concavity required to rationalize warranty choices. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We find that consumer choices imply riskaversion coefficients such that they will reject a gamble that has an equal chance of winning $100 and losing $5 or less. Thus, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rabin and Thaler (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sydnor (2010)</ref>, an extreme degree of risk aversion (curvature) is required to rationalize warranty choices and the premia paid for them.</p><p>We consider three different dimensions leading to risk-averse behavior: risk aversion, which is equivalent to diminishing returns in utility; loss aversion, in which losses loom larger than gains of similar magnitude; and nonlinear weighting (also known as decision weighting) of failure probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kahneman and Tversky 1979</ref>). 6 7 Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">KÃ¶bberling and Wakker (2005)</ref>, we view risk attitude as stemming 4 http://www.bbb.org/us/article/know-the-deal-on-extended -warranties-and-service-contracts-2443 and http://www.cbsnews .com/stories/2007/08/10/earlyshow/contributors/raymartin/ main3156565.shtml. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Details of the calibration exercise are present in the online appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1287/mksc.2014.0879). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Henceforth, we will refer to risk attitude stemming from a concave utility function as risk aversion and that stemming from greater sensitivity to losses as loss aversion. We make this distinction only to make discussion of results easier. <ref type="bibr">7</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wakker et al. (1997)</ref> rationalize warranty purchases through loss aversion and nonlinear weights consumers assign to failure probabilities.</p><p>from three different components: risk aversion (curvature of utility function), loss aversion, and decision weighting. All three components should be taken into account simultaneously to assess the risk attitude (risk averse or risk seeking) and predict individual behavior. We disentangle these risk preferences and study their relative importance in explaining warranty choices and their impact on product and warranty pricing. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Separating these risk preferences requires within-consumer variation in failure probabilities and other product characteristics. To the extent that we do not observe failure probabilities in field data, any inference hinges on parametric assumptions and assumptions about rational expectations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cohen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Einav 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen et al. 2009</ref>). 9 Estimates of probability weights are thus contingent on these assumptions and may lead to biased estimates of curvature of the utility function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abdellaoui et al. 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We design conjoint surveys in which we give beliefs to subjects, consequently facilitating nonparametric identification of risk preferences that we could otherwise not achieve in panel data. Using stated preference data as opposed to scanner data, however, poses a trade-off between the purchase setting and the ability to recover unbiased estimates. <ref type="bibr">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bryant and Gerner (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huysentruyt and Read (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chu and Chintagunta (2009)</ref> estimate demand for warranties assuming a concave utility function. By contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Padmanabhan and Rao (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Padmanabhan (1995)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Soberman (2003)</ref> study partial warranty coverage and reasons for the existence of warranties but do not estimate demand for warranties. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In Â§2.2, we shed more light on the identification issues related to panel data. <ref type="bibr">10</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barseghyan et al. (2013)</ref> use data on deductible choices in auto and home insurance and rely on parametric assumptions to estimate risk preferences. Contrary to our finding, they conclude that nonlinear probability weighting drives insurance choices.</p><p>We study consumer decisions related to extended warranties in the context of purchasing a washing machine (washer). As per Consumer Reports, washing machines typically have a 25%-29% failure rate in the first four years of service, and the attachment rate of warranties is upward of 20%. 11 Further, unlike electronic goods, retailers do not engage in intertemporal price discrimination for washing machines, and the decision of not buying does not hinge on expectations about future product characteristics. Together, these features make washers a relevant and appealing context. Whereas firms such as Best Buy stress warranty characteristics only after product purchase (and try to sell warranties once the consumer makes the product purchase decision), others such as Abt Electronics simultaneously provide product and warranty information as a joint decision. The former implies a sequential decision-making process, whereas the latter implies a simultaneous process. In the absence of any theoretical guidance on whether warranty purchase is a simultaneous or sequential process, we design two conjoint studies-one with the simultaneous choice of washer and warranty and a second one with warranty choice conditional on washer choice. We estimate and compare preferences from these studies to ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) understand what drives extended warranty choices, (2) explore the high premia paid, and (3) study the impact of the decision-making process on preferences and pricing.</p><p>Reduced-form analysis of the raw data provides overwhelming evidence in support of loss aversion and reference dependence. We obtain four key results. First, on average, subjects have a slightly concave value function and are roughly three to four times more sensitive to losses than to gains, which, although on the higher side, is consistent with the vast behavioral literature in which the loss-aversion parameter is estimated around 2.25. We find evidence in support of probability weighting, and consistent with the literature, find on average an inverse S-shaped weighting function. Considerable heterogeneity exists in all risk preferences. Second, based on the out-of-sample predictions, and after accounting for product and price preferences, loss aversion explains warranty choices substantially better than curvature and weights assigned to failure probabilities. These findings are robust to alternate functionalform assumptions.</p><p>Third, failure to separate different risk preferences leads to biased estimates of price sensitivity and willingness to pay, which has important managerial implications for product and warranty pricing and translates to around 38% (23%) lower profits under the simultaneous (sequential) model. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Finally, based on the sequential survey, we find that retailers have an incentive to price discriminate by charging high markups for extended warranties as observed in practice. This finding has implications for how extended warranties should be sold. Forcing separate retailers to sell washers and warranties leads to a 7% increase in the washer price and a 3% decrease in the warranty price. Together, these price changes make the consumers worse off, and they need to be given an average of $36 (3.34% of washer price) to make them indifferent to the policy change.</p><p>This research contributes to the marketing and behavioral economics literature in several ways. First, we make a methodological contribution through the survey design that allows us to nonparametrically (and jointly) estimate risk and product preferences. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Second, we quantify the relative importance of different risk preferences in explaining warranty choices and highlight the managerial implications for pricing. The extant literature finds incidence of different risk preferences but does not elaborate on their relative importance in making choices. Third, we test the retailers' incentives to price discriminate <ref type="bibr">(Oi 1971, Rosen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rosenfield 1997)</ref> and understand the role of preferences in how extended warranties should be sold. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We explore whether warranties should be sold independently, and whether high premiums for warranties are driven solely by retailers acting as monopolists, as posited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kunreuther and Pauly (2006)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research empirically explores the complementary goods nature of products and warranties and its impact on pricing and policy.</p><p>This research draws from several different streams of literature. First and foremost, we study the role of reference dependence and "prospect theoretic" preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tversky 1979, Tversky and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahneman 1992)</ref> in extended warranty choices. Our research is similar in spirit to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoemaker and Kunreuther (1979)</ref> who show that insurance choices involving monetary gambles are more consistent with prospect theory (than with expected utility theory). Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ho et al. (2006)</ref>, we estimate consumers' intrinsic preference for warranty (peace of Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 39-58, Â© 2015 INFORMS mind), which may be viewed as an inflation in product value through warranty purchase (endowment effect). Second, we extend the marketing literature on reference prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Winer 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Hardie et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bell and Lattin 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Erdem et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Bronnenberg and Wathieu 1996</ref> to risky choices, while allowing consumers to be more sensitive to warranty prices as compared to product prices (asymmetric response). <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Â§2, we outline the model and identification strategy. In Â§3, we present survey design, data description, and reduced-form results. Sections 4 and 5 report estimation details and results. We discuss the pricing implications in Â§6 and conclude in Â§7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology Overview</head><p>Consumers' decision to purchase extended warranties could either be simultaneous (joint with product purchase) or sequential (conditional on product purchase). <ref type="bibr">16</ref> One objective of this paper is to estimate and compare preferences across different decisionmaking processes. Thus, we first present a simultaneous model of consumers' purchase decisions for durable goods with an associated failure probability.</p><p>We then offer a brief discussion on the limitations of panel data and how preferences can be nonparametrically identified from survey data. Finally, we outline the sequential model of decision making.</p><p>Although we apply our model in the context of washing machines, the model is extremely general and can be easily extended to other durable goods and insurance. Consistent with prospect theory, we first define a value function for any utility index y (utility a risk-neutral subject would get) and reference point r as v y r such that 17</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v y r = ï£± ï£² ï£³ v g y â r + z r y â¥ r v l y â r + z r y &lt; r (1)</formula><p>where v g â¢ and v l â¢ are the value functions in gains and losses, respectively, and (z r ) is the value from consumption of r. Utility from the reference point <ref type="bibr">15 GÃ¤chter et al. (2010)</ref> use monetary gambles to compare loss aversion in risk-less and risky choices. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> If we believe consumers decide between buying a better product without a warranty and a lower-quality product with a warranty, this decision is a simultaneous one. On the contrary, if product choice is independent of whether to buy a warranty or not, the warranty purchase decision is sequential. <ref type="bibr">17</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref> use the phrase "value function" (as opposed to utility function) to highlight the fact that the argument is a gain (loss) measured with respect to a reference point. The utility function commonly referred to when using expected utility theory has the final consumption state as its argument (as opposed to gains or losses).</p><p>(z r ) is common to all alternatives and is irrelevant to decision making. We define gains and losses over utility index, and consistent with the reference price literature, allow warranty price to be treated as a loss as compared to product price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Simultaneous Choice Model</head><p>Consumers simultaneously choose between J = 2 in our application) different washing machines, with or without warranty, and the outside option of no purchase. Let x j = p j j c j X j be a vector including the product price p j , warranty price j , repair cost c j , and a vector of product attributes X j for washer j, respectively. We define y x j i as the linear utility index corresponding to the deterministic utility a consumer i gets from buying brand j or paying a repair cost; i are the consumer-specific preference parameters. Washing machines fail for a variety of reasons related to motor, valves, pump, timer, and so on. Accounting for the risk from failure, and utilizing Equation (1), the value consumer i gets from buying brand j with no warranty (nw) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u nw ij = i j v y nw ij r failure + 1 â i j v y nw ij r no failure + nw ij (2)</formula><p>where i j is the weight consumer i assigns to failure probability j for brand j, 18 and nw ij are the random utility shocks unobserved to the researcher.</p><p>We assume the reference point of a consumer before making any decision is the utility from no purchase (status quo). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Thus, the value consumers get from no purchase is v 0 , which is normalized to 0, that is, v 0 = 0. Once the consumer decides to purchase the product, the reference point shifts to the utility a consumer gets from a working product; which, implicitly implies consumers segregate gains and losses from product (and warranty) purchase and repair costs, and have different mental accounts for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Thaler 1985)</ref>. Hence, although product price is not considered a loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Novemsky and Kahneman 2005)</ref>, the repair cost is perceived as a loss relative to the utility from consumption. 20 18 Under prospect theory, probability weights could be different in the gains and losses domain. The model outlined here assumes the same probability weighting function in both gains and losses. This assumption is not critical to model identification; rather, it is made for ease of estimation. Model outline and discussion on identification with separate probability weights can be requested from the author. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">KÅszegi and Rabin (2006)</ref> outline a theory for endogenous reference-point formation, recent empirical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(von Gaudecker et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Bruhin et al. 2010</ref>) assumes an exogenous reference point. We maintain this assumption in current research, and do robustness checks in the online appendix. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The value function implies consumers have different mental accounts for (and segregate, as opposed to integrate) utility from Conditional on the product failing, the value consumer i gets from purchasing brand j without warranty can now be written as v y nw ij r failure = v y nw ij + v l y c ij , where v l y c ij represents the negative value (considered a loss) a consumer gets from paying repair costs and is measured with respect to the utility from a working product. The utility index subsumes the reference point, and product preferences are measured relative to this reference point. Further, given that the reference point is common to all alternatives, the value from the reference point is rescaled to 0. Similarly, the value consumer i gets from purchasing brand j without warranty (conditional on no failure) is given by v y nw ij r no failure = v y nw ij . Combining these equations, Equation (2) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u nw ij = v y nw ij + i j v l y c ij + nw ij = v * i nw x j + nw ij (3)</formula><p>Assume consumers do not incur any repair costs if the product fails under warranty, and that the retailer provides the same quality of service irrespective of whether the consumer bought a warranty. Given the reference-point assumption, the value consumer i gets from buying brand j with warranty (w) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u w ij = v y w ij + w ij = v * i w x j + w ij (4)</formula><p>and is independent of the failure probability and repair costs. Finally, the value consumer i gets from no purchase is given by u i 0 = i 0 . To avoid the no-purchase decision being contingent on the vector of current state variables (e.g., beliefs about future product characteristics or product characteristics at other stores), the outside option is restricted to using the current method of doing laundry (laundromat or using the current washer, etc.). A consumer adopts brand j (with or without warranty) if and only if v * i k x j + k ij â¥ v * i k x j + k ij for all j j â J , and k k â w nw , where j = j and/or k = k . We assume the random utility shocks are type I extreme value distributed. For each consumer i we observe the adoption choice d k ij where d k ij = 1 if consumer i chooses brand j with k â w nw and d k ij = 0 otherwise. The conditional choice probability (CCP) that consumer i chooses brand j with (without) warranty is then given by a multinomial logit model of the form Pr</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d k ij = 1 = exp v * i k x j 1 + j âJ k â w nw exp v * i k x j<label>(5)</label></formula><p>product purchase and repair costs. This is intuitive given repair costs are (potentially) incurred in the future, and is consistent with the silver-lining effect in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jarnebrant et al. (2009)</ref> and with <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ho and Zhang (2008)</ref>. We report estimates from robustness checks around the assumption of reference point and mental accounting in the online appendix. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tversky and Kahneman (1991)</ref>, we do find some differences in the estimates of loss aversion and price sensitivity, but overall, the qualitative findings and out-ofsample predictions stay the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Identification of Risk Preferences</head><p>Previous approaches that nonparametrically identify risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdellaoui 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Abdellaoui et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Gonzalez and Wu 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Booij and van de Kuilen 2009</ref> rely on prior knowledge of whether an outcome is a gain or a loss, and work only when utility is defined over a single characteristic (e.g., money). By contrast, utility from consumption is a multidimensional construct that depends on unobserved individual-specific preferences. Further, a prospect cannot a priori be classified as a gain or a loss, making a direct application of such approaches to consumption contexts difficult. This paper differs from previous work in that it extends the literature on nonparametric identification to settings in which utility is defined over multiple characteristics and a prospect cannot be preclassified as a gain or a loss. Note that the model outlined above assumes that failure probabilities are known to consumers and observed by researchers. As we outline below, knowledge of and within-consumer variation in failure probabilities is critical to get unbiased estimates of risk preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abdellaoui et al. (2008)</ref> show that if consumers substantially overweight smaller probabilities, risk-averse behavior and convex value function can coexist. Put differently, estimating the individual-level weighting function is key to providing unbiased estimates of the curvature of the value function. Scanner data on purchases of bigticket items are typically cross-sectional and include one observation per consumer, thus making estimation of individual-level preferences impossible. Even if researchers have access to panel data, failure probabilities are unobserved and researchers rely on the assumption of rational expectations. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Thus, using scanner data (panel or cross-sectional) requires one to make strong assumptions about the failure probabilities and weighting function, which may bias value function curvature estimates. Stated preference data are better suited to this problem because of the researchers' ability to control and manipulate failure probabilities (and other characteristics) within subjects. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> We now outline a proof for nonparametric identification of risk preferences that exploits withinconsumer (subject) variation in washer and warranty characteristics. We discuss identification for the simultaneous decision-making process outlined in Â§2.1.</p><p>Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 39-58, Â© 2015 INFORMS 2.2.1. Utility index. Suppressing the individual and brand subscripts, we first define the utility index from product purchase and payment for repairs as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y w = h X w â p â (6) y nw = h X nw â p (7) y c = â c (8)</formula><p>where h X k k â w nw is some arbitrary function of product characteristics (X) and intrinsic preferences; measures the asymmetric response to product and warranty prices. We allow warranty price to be considered a loss relative to the product price, which is based on our reduced-form findings (reported in Â§3.3) and is consistent with the literature. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> We allow subjects to have different preferences for the product with (without) warranty. Allowing for mental accounting makes the choice-specific value additively separable in brand preference and probability weighting function, which facilitates separate estimation of brand preference and intrinsic preference for warranties. For the discussion on identification, we normalize the price coefficient in the utility index to 1, and ignore the k subscript and consider one function h X . <ref type="bibr">24</ref> In Â§4, we generalize the expression for utility index.</p><p>The model primitives we need to identify include (components of) utility index y, value function v y , and probability weighting function . Assuming we have access to an arbitrarily large data set generated from consumer choices, we can observe the conditional choice probabilities associated with different alternatives. Given these CCPs and the type 1 extreme value distribution assumption, the choicespecific value differences ( â1 k x ) can be inferred by a simple inversion of choice probabilities as follows: 25 26</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">â1 w x = v * w x â v 0 (9) = log Pr d w = 1 â log Pr d 0 = 1 (10)</formula><p>Let be the support of x. Assume the support is large enough such that for any X , an x â exists such that (i) X is the X-component of x and (ii) v * w x = v h X â p â = 0. Thus, for any product and warranty price and characteristics X , we can find a corresponding h X and such that h X â p â = 0. The entire function h X (and ) is nonparametrically identified by varying product characteristics and product or warranty prices. If h X â¥ 0 that is, if the product is weakly desirable when price equals zero (apart from idiosyncratic reasons captured by the latent utility term), the assumption on the support of can be achieved by varying the price p sufficiently for any X value. Note that the loss-aversion parameter is nonparametrically identified from the value function asymmetry as we detail below. Varying sensitivity to product and warranty prices aids identification of loss aversion.</p></div>

The value function in gains and losses is identified as long as the utility index contains some positively valued attribute allowing it to take values in both gains and losses domains. The identification argument is exactly the same as that for utility functions in nonlinear discrete choice models.</p><p>Under expected utility theory, risk aversion is a measure of the curvature of the value (utility) function. Conditional on nonparametrically estimating the value function in gains and losses, we can get an estimate of value function curvature in gains and losses separately, which provides a measure of risk aversion. The literature has defined loss aversion based on the ratio of value function, rate of change of value function, and so on, at different points (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">KÃ¶bberling and Wakker 2005</ref> for more details). Yet, if we know the shape of the value function in gains and losses, we can estimate loss aversion subject to any definition. Broadly speaking, the identification of loss aversion rests on the asymmetry in the value function in gains and losses, and response to product and warranty prices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Sequential Choice Model</head><p>We now outline the sequential choice model in the context of a conjoint survey. The sequential choice model differs from the simultaneous model in that decision making is a two-stage process. In the first stage, subjects make a washer choice and, conditional on purchase, in the second stage, they make a decision with respect to the warranty. The value subjects get from purchasing brand j washer in the first stage is given by u ij = v y ij + ij .

Additionally, subjects are allowed to not purchase the washer altogether.

In discussions with different retailers, we learned salespeople focus on failure rate and repair costs only after consumers choose a washer. Thus, the no-purchase option in the second stage allows consumers to not purchase the washer after learning about failure characteristics. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> We allow preference parameters from the first and second stages to be correlated to account for the possible correlation between utility from product adoption and warranty purchase.</p><p>Using Bayes' rule, the unconditional probability of purchasing a washer with a warranty is given by Pr <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Compared to the simultaneous model, in the sequential model, washer choice is independent of warranty price and repair costs of all competing brands, and the decision to purchase a warranty is independent of the competing brands' characteristics.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">d w ij = 1 = Pr d w ij = 1 d ij = 1 Pr d ij = 1 .</formula><p>Extending the identification proof to the sequential decision-making process is straightforward. Intuitively, the value function (utility index, risk and loss aversion) is identified from the first-stage choices concerning washing machines, where failure probability does not influence choice-specific values. Conditional on the identification of value function, we identify the probability weighting function and warranty preference from within-subject variation in failure probabilities, repair costs, and warranty choices in the second stage. 30</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Survey and Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Survey Design.</head><p>As we point out earlier, there is no theoretical guidance on whether washer and warranty purchase is a simultaneous or sequential decision. Further, in practice, we find support for both simultaneous and sequential decision making. Thus, we design two online conjoint surveys differing in the simultaneity of washer and warranty choice. Whereas the first survey is consistent with a simultaneous decision-making process wherein subjects simultaneously make purchase decisions for a washer and a warranty, the second survey is consistent with sequential decision making and subjects make a purchase decision for a warranty only once they've chosen to purchase the washer. In both surveys, several introductory screens provide subjects an overview of the washing machines and possible benefits of buying an extended warranty. Subjects are informed that the retailer repairs washers and that the quality of service provided is independent of warranty purchase.</p><p>Marketing Science 34(1), pp. 39-58, Â© 2015 INFORMS Further, the repair costs and failure probabilities are provided to the subjects and are manipulated across choice tasks. Providing subjects this information is important to rule out arguments in favor of convenience or search costs related to finding a repair shop, and uncertainty associated with failure characteristics and quality of service, which could lead to background risk and provide biased estimates of risk preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Harrison et al. 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr">31</ref> The online appendix presents the screen providing subjects information about product characteristics they see in each choice task.</p><p>In the simultaneous survey, subjects choose between two competing washing machines (with or without warranty) and not buying the product. The online appendix presents a standard choice task in the simultaneous survey. To make the product choices realistic, in addition to the washer brand, we include the loading type (front versus top) as a washer characteristic. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> On each screen, subjects have the option of seeing other characteristics common to both washers and characteristics of the warranty being offered. Each subject completes a total of three blocks that are randomly assigned to subjects. Across choice tasks, we vary all of the product characteristics shown to subjects. We vary the failure probability between 5% and 80% to facilitate estimation of probability weights. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> In the sequential survey, subjects first choose between alternate brands of washers. If the subjects choose to purchase a washer, we provide information about failure probability, warranty price, and repair costs specific to the chosen washer. The subjects then make a warranty choice and are allowed to not purchase the washer (after learning about the failure characteristics) as well. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> First-and second-stage <ref type="bibr">31</ref> In the survey, we provide subjects detailed information on product characteristics and how each characteristic relates to performance. We inform them that the washers differ only on these characteristics and perform identically with respect to all other characteristics. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> One possible critique of the surveys is that we make subjects focus on characteristics that might not otherwise be important in their decision making. For example, consumers may not explicitly think of repair costs or may not account for probabilities in terms of numbers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Williamson et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huysentruyt and Read (2010)</ref> show that consumers think about washer prices and repair costs and know how to account for failure probabilities. Thus, evidence in the literature suggests that the characteristics shown to subjects in the surveys are important and that consumers consider them in their warranty purchase decisions. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> We over-weigh probabilities in the range of true failure rates as per Consumer Reports. Larger probabilities are used to make sure that estimates of weighting function are not driven by parametric assumptions. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> As with monetary gambles, risk preferences in the context of product and warranties can also be elicited from a completely choice tasks from the sequential choice survey are available in the online appendix. Each subject completes two blocks of questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data Description.</head><p>We collected the data using the online panel of Global Market Insight, Inc., a national market research company. The panel is representative of the U.S. population. Three hundred twenty-six (236) respondents completed the simultaneous (sequential) surveys, resulting in a total of 7,248 (4,719) choices. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> The distribution of demographics in the sample is reported in the online appendix. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> summarizes purchasing habits and familiarity with washers and warranties across subjects. In both studies, the majority of subjects were familiar with extended warranties before they took the survey and over three-quarters had purchased warranties for either home appliances or electronics goods. Around 70% of the subjects had purchased a washer in the past and over 80% use a washer at least once a week or more. All subjects found the survey questions to be clear and over 70% of the subjects believed the prices and characteristics shown were realistic. Thus, subjects sampled are not only representative of the population, but are also relevant for this research.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, we present the distribution of modal choices, the number of times modal choice is chosen, and the number of distinct choices within each block of questions. We find that subjects choose all of the choices with product purchase with a warranty being the more favored choice across both surveys. In the sequential survey, we observe a small fraction of subjects for whom the modal choice is not to purchase the washer after learning about the failure characteristics. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Within each block, the majority of subjects chose the modal choice between three to six times, suggesting substantial variation in choices. The same pattern is present in the number of distinct choices chosen within each block, where the majority of the subjects chose more than two distinct choices. This within-subject variation is crucial to estimating heterogeneous product and risk preferences. Finally, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, based on the simultaneous survey, shows that the warranty attachment rate initially increases with increasing failure probability but is relatively constant for failure probabilities in excess of 35%. different survey design in which, instead of choices, subjects provide willingness to pay for a warranty. In the online appendix, we report risk preferences from such an experiment, which are similar to those found in the base model. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> We ensured that no overlap occurred in the subjects sampled across the two experiments. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> These choice patterns provide some validity to the assumption that subjects do not account for failure characteristics while making washer purchase decisions in the first stage. Note. The table summarizes the subjects' familiarity with warranties and their usage and purchase behavior for washing machines, for both the simultaneous and sequential choice surveys. Notes. The table summarizes the distribution of modal choices, number of times modal choice is chosen, and the number of different choices made, across both surveys. The number of distinct choices are calculated as follows. In the simultaneous survey, subjects have five different possible choices. If, for example, a subject chose to buy the same product with or without warranty across all choice tasks, the subject would have made two distinct choices.  Notes. The figure shows the variation in warranty attachment rate (percentage of washer purchases associated with a warranty) with failure probability. The shaded area shows the 95% credibility region around the attachment rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Reduced-Form Results.</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> reports results from logistic regressions based on the surveys. Focusing first on the simultaneous survey, we find that subjects have a lower preference for front-loading washing machines and almost equally prefer the two brands, which is consistent with the information provided in the survey. Subjects are almost four to five times as sensitive to expected repair costs (c â¢ ) and warranty prices, as compared to product price. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> Respondents are almost equally sensitive to warranty prices and repair costs. Thus, we allow data to guide our model, and treat warranty prices as a loss, compared to product prices. If repair costs and product prices are measured from different (same) reference points, varying sensitivity to product prices and repair costs provides evidence for reference-dependent preferences (loss aversion). Without imposing more structure on the utility function, we cannot conclude whether these results are driven by loss-aversion or reference-dependent preferences. We also find evidence in favor of a nonlinear effect of failure probability on product (and warranty) purchase.</p><p>In the sequential survey, product price has a negative and significant effect on washer choice. Comparing the two stages of the sequential survey data, we again find that subjects are more sensitive to <ref type="bibr">37</ref> The qualitative findings stay the same even after we allow for higher-order terms of product and warranty prices (i.e., controlling for curvature).

Subjects are also more likely to buy a warranty for more expensive washers, as can be seen from the positive and significant effect of washer price on warranty choice. Subjects have a high intrinsic preference for warranties and we do not find much nonlinear effect of failure probability. Taken together, these results provide evidence in support of loss aversion (and/or reference dependence) and mixed evidence for the nonlinear effect of failure probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Estimation Details</head><p>Given the relatively small panel, we make functionalform assumptions for the value and probability weighting functions. The functional-form assumptions are consistent across both surveys. <ref type="bibr">38</ref> We use a power value function given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">v y k ij = y k ij i y k ij â¥ 0 â i ây k ij i y k ij &lt; 0 (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where gains and losses are measured with respect to the reference point. Specifically, preferences in the utility index are measured with respect to the individual reference point.

The first two models are special cases of the full model in which we restrict either the risk-aversion parameter ( i ) or the loss-aversion parameter ( i ) to be 1. We call these models the loss only and risk only models, respectively. Both models allow for referencedependent preferences and probability weights. We estimate a third expected utility model consistent with expected utility theory (not allowing for loss aversion and probability weights). Note that the expected utility model is not "nested" in the full model specification because of the presence of reference-dependent preferences.</p><p>Unlike von Gaudecker et al. ( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>), we estimate the loss-aversion parameter freely. We estimate the curvature of the value function subject to the restriction i â¥ 0 to ensure the value function is monotonically increasing. Additionally, we restrict i â¥ 0. We impose these restrictions by expressing the curvature and the weighting function parameter using an exponential transformation based on unrestricted parameters i and i such that i = exp i and i = exp i . <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Let vector i denote the subjects' taste parameters, ij k i i i i i We allow for heterogeneity by assuming the subjects' parameters are drawn from a common population normal distribu-</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">tion: i â¼ N Â¯ V</formula><p>Priors on the population hyperparameters,Â¯ and V are specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">V â¼ N 0 a â1 V (25) V â¼ IW I (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>where a = 1/16 and = dim i + 3 are proper but very diffuse prior settings.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>We now discuss the estimates from the models outlined in Â§ Â§2 and 4. For each model, we report  results for both homogeneous and heterogeneous (normally distributed random coefficients) specifications. In each case, we report quantiles of the posterior distribution of the population hyper-parameters to assess the parameter magnitudes and precisions. We also report the log marginal density (computed using the Newton and Raftery 1994 approach) as well as a trimmed log marginal density in which we trim the upper and lower two percentile posterior draws to correct for outlier effects. Comparing log marginal densities across models is roughly equivalent to computing a Bayes factor to assess relative posterior model fit. For more details on the estimation of log marginal densities and Bayes factor, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rossi et al. (2005)</ref> (Chapter 6). Simultaneous Survey. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> reports results for all of the model specifications. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity substantially improves the model fit. The full model fits the data substantially better than any of the alternate specifications. The risk only and loss only models fit the data worse than the baseline model, providing strong evidence against the restrictions i = 1 and i = 1. Both of these models outperform the expected utility model, which highlights the importance of accounting for reference dependence and loss aversion.</p><p>In the full model, subjects have a slightly concave value function with an average curvature parameter of = 0 83, but substantial heterogeneity exists in the curvature of the value function. The most important finding is the average loss-aversion estimate of 3.05. Although slightly on the higher side, the estimate is consistent with the literature in which the average loss aversion is estimated to be between 2 and 2.25. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity in the degree of loss aversion across subjects. The left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the weighting function and the 95% credibility region for the average consumer. The inverted S-shape is consistent with the findings in the literature. Finally, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Peck and Shu (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ho et al. (2006)</ref>, we find that subjects have a high intrinsic preference for warranties (peace of mind), which leads to a higher willingness to pay for warranties, and, along with risk preferences, rationalizes warranty choices.</p><p>Not allowing for loss aversion in the expected utility and risk only models leads to an upward bias in the price coefficient estimate. Restricting subjects to exhibit no loss aversion (risk only model) increases their preference for the washer, has an upward bias on price sensitivity, and changes the degree of curvature. However, assuming subjects have a linear value function (loss only model) does not affect washer and warranty preference or price sensitivity, and only marginally changes the sample distribution of loss aversion. To summarize, we find that (i) subjects are loss averse, (ii) substantial heterogeneity exists in risk preferences, and (iii) failure to decompose risk preferences leads to biased estimates of risk aversion (curvature), price sensitivity, and washer and warranty preference.</p><p>Sequential Survey. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> reports results for all of the model specifications.

We test for the relative importance of risk preferences in two different ways. For both tests, we estimate models on a subset of data and randomly select around five to six choices per subject for the holdout sample. We then use demand estimates based on the subsample to test out-of-sample fit. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> presents results from out-of-sample predictions made using data from the two surveys.</p><p>First, we assess and compare the importance of curvature and loss aversion in the risk only and loss only models, respectively. Focusing on columns 1 and 4, the out-of-sample hit rate (percentage of correct predictions) for the risk only model is 55% and 64% for the simultaneous and sequential surveys, respectively. Product and price preferences correctly predict 55% (63%) of the choices. 41 Therefore, risk preferences (curvature and probability weights) in the risk only model only marginally improve the model prediction. By contrast, loss aversion and probability weights improve the loss only model prediction by 8% (56%-48%) and 5% (67%-62%) for the simultaneous and sequential surveys, respectively, providing evidence of the relative importance of loss aversion in predicting choices. This effect is more pronounced Notes. The graph displays the pointwise posterior mean and 90% credibility region of the marginal density of the loss-aversion parameter from the full model based on both the simultaneous and sequential choice surveys. We estimate the loss aversion-parameter freely.</p><p>if we compare the effect of risk preferences on warranty choices (columns 3 and 6). Not allowing for loss aversion in the loss only model has a bigger impact on the hit rate than not allowing for risk aversion in the risk only model. When subjects do not purchase warranties (columns 2 and 5), risk preferences do not substantially affect the hit rate.</p><p>Second, we study how adding risk preferences to the full model improves model predictions. We first use all of the demand estimates to make out-of-sample predictions. Consequently, we assume i = i = i = 1 and only use product and price preferences to make out-of-sample predictions. Intuitively, the difference in accuracy between these two predictions can be attributed to risk aversion, loss aversion, and probability weights. We then take turns "switching on" each of these parameters one at a time and report the outof-sample predictions. In the lower panel of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>, we report the model prediction for all choices, and by warranty and no warranty purchases separately. For the simultaneous survey, adding curvature or probability weights does not improve prediction, whereas adding loss aversion improves prediction from 50% to 53%. This finding again provides evidence of the relative importance of loss aversion as compared to curvature and probability weights. Similarly, in the sequential study, adding loss aversion improves prediction more than adding either curvature or probability weights. Together these two tests provide substantial evidence that loss aversion is significantly more important than risk aversion (curvature) and probability weights in explaining warranty choices.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Pricing Implications</head><p>We use the demand estimates from full and expected utility models to understand the pricing implications of decomposing different risk preferences. As compared to a standard conjoint analysis, the structure of our model allows us to understand choices a rational consumer would make, and how consumers would respond to different pricing policies. Specifically, we use the model structure to address how risk preferences affect pricing and firm profits, and study the impact of risk preferences on the premia paid for warranties. Finally, we do counterfactual analysis to understand whether warranties should be sold only through independent retailers.</p><p>Managerial Implications. In the previous section, we found that failure to decompose risk preferences results in an upward bias in price sensitivity and washer and warranty preference. Intuitively, more price sensitive consumers will reduce the retailers' pricing power and adversely affect profits. We now quantify the effect of biased estimate of price sensitivity on washer prices and firm profits. To do so, we consider a monopolist who sells only the GE washer and consumers have the option of purchasing it with or without a warranty or choosing the outside option of no purchase. We compare optimal washer prices, and profits based on the full model with those based on the expected utility model. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Firms can vary the washer and warranty prices, and repair costs (to the consumer) such that the optimal profits remain unchanged. Thus, we cannot jointly maximize profits over these prices and costs simultaneously. Assuming that the firm charges marginal cost for product repair and extended warranty, the firms profit as a function of washer price (p) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">p = p â c p p c r + p p w c r f d (27)</formula><p>where c p is the product cost to the retailer, c r is the repair cost to the consumer, is the failure probability,</p><p>â¢ is the demand for washer (only), and â¢ is the demand for washer with warranty. Optimal prices and profits corresponding to the expected utility model form a benchmark for comparing pricing and profits under alternate preferences/models.</p><p>The bottom panel of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that in the simultaneous (sequential) survey, higher price sensitivity and biased washer and warranty preferences lead to roughly 16% (20%) lower washer prices under the expected utility model as compared to the full model. Relieving consumers of their behavioral bias reduces risk-averse behavior and allows retailers to charge a 17% (3%) higher price (as compared to the full model) for the washer in the simultaneous (sequential) study. The top panel of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the optimal profits under different models, for both simultaneous and sequential surveys. We focus on the sequential survey in the interest of space. First, pricing to expected utility maximizers results in around 23% lower profit as compared to the full model. Second, if consumers are relieved of their behavioral bias, the higher washer price results in around 17% more  Notes. The figure shows the optimal washer prices ($'00s) and corresponding profits ($'00s) for a monopolist retailer, for a wide range of washer costs. The left (right) panel shows results from the simultaneous (sequential) survey, and the top (bottom) panel shows the optimal profits (washer prices). These prices have been calculated assuming the retailer sells both washers and warranties, but makes profit only from washers. The figures show the optimal prices and profits using estimates from the full model (and assuming that consumers are loss averse and have reference-dependent preferences), from the expected utility model (and assuming that consumers are expected utility maximizers), and from the full model but after eliminating behavioral biases (loss aversion and decision weighting).

The table summarizes results from the test of the single crossing property, for both simultaneous and sequential surveys. The table reports the 95% confidence region as well as the median estimate for the likelihood that the marginal washing machine consumer buys a warranty, the average likelihood of buying a warranty among all of the washing machine consumers, and their difference. a Assumes washer price of $599, warranty price of $99, repair costs of $249, and failure probability of 25%. These numbers are consistent with the average failure rate and prices as per Consumer Reports, and observed in practice.</p><p>incentive to price discriminate among consumers buying washers and warranties. We test retailers' incentives to price discriminate and whether price discrimination leads to the high premia consumers routinely pay for extended warranties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Oi (1971)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref> outline the econometric condition (subject to some assumptions) under which it is optimal for a firm to charge a premium on aftermarket goods (e.g., extended warranties). Let be a vector of product and risk preferences, and * p denote the marginal consumer who is indifferent between buying and not buying the washer at any price p. In the context of washers and warranties, the econometric condition can be written out as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Pr warranty = 1 * p &lt; Æ Pr warranty = 1 v p &gt; v p * p (28)</formula><p>where v p is the value a subject with preference vector gets from buying the washer at price p. Equation (28), also known as the single crossing property, implies a firm should charge high markups on extended warranties if, at any washer and warranty price, the probability that the marginal washing machine consumer buys the warranty is lower than the average probability of warranty purchase among all of the consumers who buy the washing machine at that price. Intuitively, Equation ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) tests for correlation between preference estimates that drive warranty choices and willingness to pay for the washer. Let z * = Pr warranty = 1 * p andz = Æ Pr warranty = 1 v p &gt; v p * p . Conversely, if z * =z, firms should instead charge a higher markup on the washing machine and sell warranties at marginal cost. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> reports the quantiles for the distribution of z, z * , andz â z * from both surveys. For the simultaneous choice survey, we find the distribution of thÄ z â z * is centered around 0, implying selling warranties at marginal cost. By contrast, for the sequential choice survey, the distribution ofz â z * has a median value of 38%, implying selling extended warranties at a premium. Recalculating the monopolist profitmaximizing prices (while allowing for profits from selling warranties) using the sequential choice data, we find it is optimal to sell extended warranties at a contribution margin of 78% with a price equal to roughly 21% of the product price. Although slightly higher, this finding is consistent with the warranty margins in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Also, the warranty price as a percentage of the product price is consistent with the industry average (15%-25%). Thus, although warranty purchases can be rationalized through risk preferences (and intrinsic preference for warranties), rationalizing the premium paid for warranties requires looking at the correlation between these preferences and the willingness to pay for the washer. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> Welfare Changes from Policy Intervention. We now estimate the discount on the washer price (measure of compensating variation) that makes subjects indifferent between the current policy (in which a retailer sells both washers and warranties) and a policy in which separate retailers sell washers and warranties. Focusing on the sequential survey, we calculate the optimal washer price for a monopolist selling only the washer (warranty price is irrelevant to this pricing decision). Given the optimal washer price, some assumed repair costs and failure probability, we maximize profits with respect to the warranty price for a monopolist selling only warranties. The washer price determines the distribution of preferences the retailer selling warranties faces and is relevant to warranty pricing. We calculate compensating variation by equating the expected maximum utility before and after the policy change.</p><p>Forcing separate retailers to sell washers and warranties increases the washer price by 7% and reduces the warranty price by 3%. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> On average, subjects need to receive a discount of $36 (3.4%) on the washer price to make them indifferent to the policy intervention. <ref type="bibr">47</ref> We find substantial heterogeneity in the discount, but almost all subjects are worse off under the new policy, so forcing separate retailers to sell washers and warranties is not necessarily welfare enhancing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>This paper contributes to the growing stream of literature on product insurance and inference using stated preference data. It is gratifying to know that a burgeoning literature applies structural models to conjoint analysis and stated preference data in contexts in which field data either do not exist or pose several limitations. We design surveys that allow for nonparametric identification of risk preferences (curvature, loss aversion, and probability weights) and product preferences, consequently alleviating the need to rely on strong parametric assumptions. We compare washer and warranty purchase decisions under two different choice mechanisms and consistently find evidence that loss aversion explains warranty purchases substantially more than curvature of the utility function and nonlinear probability weights do. Subjects exhibit substantial heterogeneity in loss aversion with an average loss-aversion parameter of 3.05 (3.99) in the simultaneous (sequential) survey. We find heterogeneity in curvature of utility function and probability weights, but these preferences explain only a small fraction of consumer choices as compared to loss aversion. These findings are robust to different specifications of the value function, probability weighting function, and reference point. A Bayesian model selection test based on the demand estimates rejects models that do not account for loss aversion and/or reference-dependent preferences.</p><p>Decomposing risk preferences has important managerial implications. First, not accounting for loss aversion, we underpredict washer prices, which leads to on average 23% lower firm profits. Correlations between subjects willingness to pay for the washer and risk preferences (which drive demand for warranties) also have important implications for pricing and selling warranties. Forcing separate retailers to sell washers and warranties leads to an increase (decrease) in the washer (warranty) price, making almost all subjects worse off. The use of a representative and knowledgeable pool of subjects ensures not only internal but also external validity of our findings. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> Assumes washer costs $500, repair cost equals $200, and failure probability is 25%. <ref type="bibr">47</ref> Robustness checks on assumed washer cost, repair cost, and failure probability yield similar results.</p><p>Several directions exist for future research based on the findings herein. First, in the surveys, subjects are provided failure probabilities and repair costs. Thus, a priori, subjects' beliefs are known to the researcher. In practice, warranty purchases are based on (and possibly driven by) the beliefs consumers have about product failure and repair costs. A possible extension would be to elicit consumers' beliefs and integrate out over their distribution to study warranty choice. Second, in our surveys, we offer subjects a single extended warranty. In practice, consumers have access to a menu of warranties varying not only in duration but also in the depth of coverage. Another interesting extension would be to design the optimal warranty contracts while accounting for consumers' elicited beliefs.</p></div>

An alternate specification (reported in the online appendix) allowing for second-stage utility to influence choice in the first stage yields qualitatively similar results.30  The choice models do not account for the fact that washer and warranty costs are incurred in the current period, whereas repair costs are (possibly) incurred in the future and should be discounted accordingly. Put differently, we implicitly assume consumers do not discount the future and consequently, estimate a lower bound on loss aversion. If subjects have a linear value function and their beliefs about when the washer fails do not vary across choice tasks, we underpredict loss aversion by up to 10%-15% for a homogeneous annual discount factor of 0.95.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="38">Robustness analysis for these assumptions (reported in the online appendix) do not change the qualitative findings.39  Please see the online appendix for further details.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="41">We make out-of-sample predictions using only product and price preferences by marginalizing out the distribution of risk preferences.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="42">This analysis is descriptive in the sense that we do not account for income effects.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="44">As in<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gil and Hartmann (2009)</ref>, we satisfy the underlying assumptions by assuming away income effects, which is standard in the discrete choice literature.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="45">To test whether model specification implicitly drives the high premia in the sequential choice study, we reestimated the sequential choice model on data from the simultaneous choice survey. Profit maximization from the demand estimates indicates only a modest increase in markup for extended warranties. Therefore, the high markup cannot entirely be attributed to model specification.</note>
