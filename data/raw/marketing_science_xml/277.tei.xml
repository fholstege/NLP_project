<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W hen match uncertainty is resolved via costly evaluation, the first product sampled by a customer is more likely to make the sale. This prompts firms to lower their products' evaluation costs to attract customers to sample their products first. Such efforts by firms are called customer learning investment (CLI). When product quality is freely observable but horizontal match is not, we examine how CLI choices interact with quality and price competition in a duopoly. CLI has a competition effect in that a higher CLI of a firm increases its demand but decreases that of its rivals. In the market-covered duopoly, both qualities will decrease (increase) when the high-end (low-end) firm invests more in customer learning, and remain unchanged when they invest equally, relative to when neither firm invests. We further show that the firm with a higher relative production efficiency invests more in customer learning than the competitor. In the market-not-covered duopoly, CLI by the lowend firm also creates a market-expansion effect by inducing some additional low-end customers to sample and purchase its product. This may induce it to invest more than the high-end firm, even when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In markets such as apparel, appliances, consumer electronics, cars, software, and industrial goods, customers often spend considerable time and effort to ascertain whether and how a product meets their idiosyncratic needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shread 2012</ref>). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Because customers recognizing a good match with a product have reduced incentive to continue to evaluate other products, each firm attempts to lower the evaluation costs of its product, hoping to woo prospective buyers to evaluate its product first. Examples abound. Some retailers run free shuttle services through major residential locations. Software vendors develop demo versions and easy to follow user manuals. Producers of enterprise software and other industrial goods maintain sales teams to showcase their products and to address questions from interested buyers.</p><p>More important, firms' product quality decisions and efforts to lower customers' evaluation costs seem to affect each other. The four antidepressants with superior quality, i.e., Sertraline, Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, and Citalopram, use stronger sampling intensities than the other antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gu and Xie 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In apparel retailing, Saks Fifth Avenue offers higher quality products and sales support than Macy's, which in turn offers better products and services than Walmart. At Apple's experience centers and stores, well trained staff introduce various product features to prospective buyers and help with their technical issues <ref type="bibr">(Wall Street Journal 2011)</ref>. As Samsung improved its product quality in recent years, it also opened its own mini stores in more than 1,400 Best Buy stores <ref type="bibr">(Wall Street Journal 2013)</ref>. Although we lack direct evidence that firms' product quality decisions depend on their effort to lower customers' evaluation costs, Apple's story indicates that such a linkage is plausible. A widely held belief is that it is Apple's superior products that draw traffic into its physical stores. Its phenomenal investment in physical stores and associated staff training leads us to expect that it will continue to develop high quality products because if its product quality deteriorates and fewer people visit its stores, the investment would be wasted.</p><p>In a duopoly, we investigate the firms' effort to ease customer evaluation of product match, hereafter called CLI, and how it interacts with their quality choices and pricing. We address several questions. First, how do the firms' CLIs affect their pricing? Second, how do product qualities change relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning, and how does the production technology drive their CLIs? Third, because the market may not be fully covered in relatively young industries, how does the equilibrium differ for covered and noncovered markets? How do the simultaneous and sequential choices of CLI and quality affect the market outcome differently? Last, when product development requires a fixed research and development (R&amp;D) cost, how does CLI drive quality provision?</p><p>Our baseline model is outlined as follows. The two firms each offer a single product with a vertical and horizontal attribute. Customers have heterogeneous preference for quality. Whereas each product's quality and price are assumed to be costlessly observable, its horizontal match is idiosyncratic and can only be determined via costly evaluation. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For simplicity, we assume the two products' match values are identically and independently distributed across customers. Each firm can lower customers' cost of evaluating its product by making proper investments. We consider a two-stage game wherein the firms first choose and commit to quality and CLI and then compete in price. Observing the decisions of both firms and her own preference for quality, each customer determines her optimal search and purchase strategy. The firms' demand then realizes.</p><p>Our main analysis focuses on a market-covered duopoly, where total industry demand is fixed. Here we reveal the competition effect of CLI: The demand of the firm making a larger CLI expands, at the expense of the competitor. Consequently, the price of the firm with a larger CLI increases whereas the other's decreases relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning. Symmetric investments do not affect the firms' demand and prices.</p><p>For fixed product qualities, we show that the firm with a production efficiency advantage makes a larger CLI because it enjoys a higher marginal return from CLI. If the products' unit cost difference is below their utility difference for the average customer, the highend firm has a higher relative production efficiency and invests more in customer learning. The low-end firm invests more otherwise.</p><p>When the firms endogenize both product quality and CLI, we obtain two results. First, if the highend (low-end) firm makes a greater CLI both product qualities will decrease (increase) relative to when neither firm invests. The reason is that the firms' relative CLIs affect their demand elasticities of quality. The demand elasticity of quality of the high-end firm is negative and that of the low-end firm is positive. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A greater CLI by the high-end firm increases its own demand elasticity and decreases the other's, prompting both firms to lower their qualities. The case wherein the low-end firm makes a greater CLI is analogous.</p><p>Second, the high-end firm invests more in customer learning if each firm's quality is below a respective threshold, and the low-end firm invests more otherwise. As in the case of fixed qualities, here the firms' (endogenous) relative production efficiencies drive their relative CLIs. The greater the ratio between the firms' unit cost difference and quality difference, the higher the low-end firm's relative production efficiency (and the lower the high-end firm's), as we assume unit production cost is a convex function of quality. When both qualities are low (high), the highend (low-end) firm has a higher relative production efficiency and makes a larger CLI.</p><p>The main analysis is extended in a few directions. First, we examine the market-not-covered duopoly, where the firms choose CLIs first, select product quality next, and set prices last. When the market is not covered, CLI by the low-end firm introduces a market-expansion effect (beside the competition effect): Some of the low-end customers would not participate in the absence of CLI, but will now sample (and purchase in case of a good match) the lowend product. This leads to some new results. When their CLIs are sufficiently close to each other, both firms' prices increase relative to when neither firm invests in customer learning. Which firm makes a larger CLI depends not only on its relative production efficiency but also on the cost of the CLI. In particular, when unit production cost remains constant over quality (so that the high-end firm has a production efficiency advantage), the low-end firm invests more if the cost of the CLI is sufficiently low, and the high-end firm invests more otherwise. Second, we analyze the three-stage CLI-quality-price game in a market-covered duopoly. When unit production cost remains constant over quality, the high-end firm's CLI (weakly) dominates that of the low-end firm, consistent with our baseline model. This contrasts with the market-not-covered case and highlights the role of the market-expansion effect of CLI. Third, we study the effect of CLI on R&amp;D competition. Whereas the low-end quality remains intact (at the lowest permissible quality), CLI lowers the high-end quality relative to when neither firm invests.</p><p>The current paper is related to the literature on consumer search. Whereas the early literature on search largely focuses on price search in markets of homogeneous goods, several models examine markets with exogenous product differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wolinsky 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bakos 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Lal and Sarvary 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Anderson and Renault 1999</ref>. More recently, researchers have begun to examine the role of search in product design. In the horizontal duopoly of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kuksov (2004)</ref>, consumers costlessly observe the product attributes but incur a search cost to discover price, and the firms are uncertain about consumers' valuation. He finds that lower search costs may lead to greater product differentiation and hence higher prices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bar-Isaac et al. (2011)</ref> show that lower search costs induce firms to choose extremal (most broad or most niche) product designs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mehta et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Liu and Dukes (2013)</ref> develop search theoretic models of consideration set formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bergen et al. (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cachon et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kuksov and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Villas-Boas (2010), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Villas-Boas (2009)</ref> focus on the role of search or evaluation cost in multiproduct firms' variety choices. Unlike our current paper, however, none of these papers examines the impacts of search on firms' product quality choices.</p><p>Our model also relates to those papers on vertical differentiation and product line design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moorthy (1984)</ref> provide early monopoly models of vertical product line design, focusing on how to mitigate cannibalization within the line. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Desai et al. (2001)</ref> examine the trade-offs of component commonality in product line design. In a duopoly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Shaked and Sutton (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moorthy (1988), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lehmann-Grube (1997)</ref> show that the firms choose differentiated qualities to relax price rivalry under various cost structures. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In an oligopoly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jing (2006)</ref> examines how the firms' relative cost efficiencies may drive their profitability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Desai (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang (2011), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Villas-Boas and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Schmidt-Mohr (1999)</ref> present competitive models of product line design and pricing. In these models, consumers have perfect information about the characteristics and prices of the products offered. In our model, quality and price are freely observable, but horizontal match is not. We analyze how firms' efforts to lower customers' costs of evaluating match interact with their quality and pricing decisions.</p><p>The role of CLI in our model is somewhat reminiscent of informative advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson and Renault 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Grossman and Shapiro 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Iyer et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Meurer and Stahl 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Soberman 2004</ref>). In models of informative advertising, those exposed to advertisements are assumed to costlessly learn the value of advertised attributes whereas the other consumers remain uninformed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Grossman and Shapiro 1984)</ref> or resort to search <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Desai et al. 2010)</ref>. Similarly, information provided by the firm is also assumed to inform consumers about their product valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lewis and Sappington 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Guo and Zhao 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, and Gu and Xie 2013</ref>. Therefore, advertising and information provision are treated as perfect substitutes for consumer search. However, whereas advertising may fully convey relatively simple product attributes, in the market scenarios noted above firms' advertising and efforts to provide information rarely eliminate search, although they effectively lower customers' evaluation costs. Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rajiv et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Renault (2009)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gu and Xie (2013)</ref> examine how the sellers' exogenous quality levels affect their advertising and information provision decisions, we also show how firms' customer learning efforts may impact their endogenous quality choices. In a setting with identical products and service free riding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Desai et al. (2010)</ref> examine retail competition in service and price advertising. However, such free riding may not arise when the firms offer distinct products (as in our model). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guo and Zhao (2009)</ref> and Liu and Xiao ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) study firms' decisions to disclose quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guo and Zhao (2009)</ref> show that competition may lead firms to reveal less information than a monopolist, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Liu and Xiao (2013)</ref> focus on how quality disclosure affects channel interactions. In the monopoly model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guo and Zhang (2012)</ref> and the duopoly model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kuksov and Lin (2010)</ref>, consumers are ex ante uncertain about their preference for quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kuksov and Lin (2010)</ref> highlights the free riding in either firm's provision of preference-revealing information. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guo and Zhang (2012)</ref>, consumers incur a deliberation cost to discover their quality preference. They show that firm profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare can all increase with consumers' deliberation cost. Our information environment contrasts with these models: Quality is common knowledge and each customer knows her quality preference. Instead, match is unknown and discovered via costly evaluation.</p><p>Jing (2011) examines a monopolist's optimal investment in facilitating consumer learning of product valuation and dynamic pricing of a durable good, and finds that it underinvests for low and high unit costs but may overinvest for intermediate unit costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gu and Liu (2013)</ref> study how a strategic retailer may benefit from manipulating consumers' search cost through shelf layout. They show that the retailer benefits more from displaying products in distant locations (i.e., increasing search cost) as the difference between their fit probabilities increases. When consumers face search costs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iyer and Kuksov (2012)</ref> analyze retail competition to attract shoppers by investing in the shopping experience. By contrast, we  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heiman and Muller 1996)</ref> and return policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davis et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Hess et al. 1996</ref>, as special forms of customer learning investments, both help mitigate customers' match uncertainty.</p><p>A model is developed in §2. Section 3 characterizes customers' optimal search behavior and the equilibrium in a market-covered duopoly. Section 4 explores a few extensions. Two benchmarks of the model are presented in §5. Section 6 summarizes this paper, discusses some of its limitations, and suggests avenues for future research. The appendix provides proofs of Propositions 2 through 6. The other proofs and deductions are given in the online appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ mksc.2015.0918).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model</head><p>Consider a duopoly wherein each firm produces a single product. Each product has two attributes, one vertical and the other horizontal (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Desai 2001</ref>). Let q i (i = 1 2) denote firm i's quality. The products differ in quality. Without loss of generality, let product 1 have a higher quality, i.e., q 1 &gt; q 2 &gt; 0. 5 Customers differ in their valuation of quality and each demand at most one unit of the product. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moorthy (1988)</ref>, we assume that a customer of type derives utility q i from a product of quality q i . Here represents the customer's constant marginal willingness to pay for quality, and is uniformly distributed over b 1 + b , where 1 4 &lt; b &lt; 1. The customer obtains an additional utility v that reflects the match between her idiosyncratic need and each product's horizontal attribute. Therefore, customer receives surplus q i + v − p i from buying product i at price p i . The two products' match values are identically and independently distributed across customers. For simplicity, we assume that v = r with probability (r &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &lt; 1), and that v = 0 otherwise. A product is said to yield a good match when v = r and a poor match when v = 0. We assume that r is sufficiently low relative to customers' valuation of quality, which ensures that the higher quality firm charges a higher price in equilibrium (see § §3.2 and 4.1 below). The distributions of customer type and match value are common knowledge, but each customer's type is known only to that customer.</p><p>We assume that each product's quality and price are costlessly observable, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Renault (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Guo and Zhang (2012)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gu and Xie (2013)</ref>. However, its match value is idiosyncratic and can only be discovered via evaluation by each customer. In several markets, prices and certain quality attributes (e.g., speed and memory of computers, resolution of digital camera, safety of cars, etc.) are well publicized by the firms themselves or authoritative third parties (such as Consumer Reports, Edmunds.com, and cNet.com). However, potential customers frequently devote time and effort to gauging how the products' horizontal features (e.g., size of clothing and shoes, interface of digital devices, exterior and interior design of cars, whether a piece of furniture suits the intended space) meet their specific needs. In addition, brands may develop certain quality reputations over time. When such mature brands release new products, they are still inspected for potential match before purchase. In the absence of firm intervention, each customer incurs cost s to evaluate either product. Throughout, we assume that s ≤ 1 − r.</p><p>The evaluation cost includes time to visit a seller and to inspect its product. Following convention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Renault 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Hauser and Wernerfelt 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Wolinsky 1986</ref>) we assume customers always incur the search or evaluation cost to purchase a product. This is plausible if returns are infeasible or costly. When buying a product requires visiting the seller, the customer may just evaluate its match before the transaction (e.g., as with clothes and shoes). For a technological product (e.g., digital device or software), evaluation is also the process of learning how to use it. Therefore, the customer would rather evaluate it before purchase.</p><p>The firms face the same technologies. Production has zero fixed costs. Following convention, we assume that the unit production cost, c q , is constant at any quality level and is an increasing, convex function of quality q. Each firm can also choose to lower customers' cost of evaluating its product. Specifically, by making an investment of k i , firm i (i = 1 2) lowers its product's evaluation cost to 1 − k i s. 6 Firm i incurs a fixed cost h k i to invest k i regardless of how many potential customers actually evaluate its product. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zettelmeyer (2000)</ref> similarly assumes that <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Alternatively, we may also model the impact of CLI k i as lowering product i's evaluation cost by an absolute amount (rather than by a percentage). This alternative assumption does not significantly alter the analysis and results. To see this, when k i lowers product i's evaluation cost to s − k i , its reservation price (see §3.1 for construction</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) R i satisfies R i = − s − k i + q i − p i + r + 1 − R i , or equivalently, R i = q i − p i + r − s − k i / .</formula><p>We can easily verify that the firms' demand functions (in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)) and the price equilibrium (in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)) continue to hold after setting s = 1. Proposition 1 thus remains intact. We can further verify that the firms' stage-1 profit functions (given by Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)) and Proposition 2 hold after setting s = 1. Propositions 3 and 4 also remain intact. The equilibrium k * 1 and k * 2 in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and Proposition 5 continue to hold after setting s = 1.</p><p>the firm incurs a fixed cost to set consumers' search cost of its product. We assume that h &gt; 0 and h &gt; 0 for 0 ≤ k i &lt; 1 and that lim k i →1− h k i = , so that it is infeasible to entirely eliminate a product's evaluation cost. Such fixed investment may include developing a demonstration version of the software, devising userfriendly manuals, maintaining a sales team to assist evaluation, and building experience centers. All else equal, a customer will first sample the product that is easier to evaluate, and may stop her search and purchase after realizing a good match. Therefore, beside quality and price, ease of evaluation is another key dimension for potential differentiation, especially for products with match uncertainty. We shall focus on the strategic impacts of CLI and its interplay with the firms' quality and price decisions.</p><p>Both firms and customers are risk neutral and maximize their own expected payoffs. Competition unfolds in two stages. In stage one, the firms simultaneously announce and commit to product qualities q i and CLI k i . In stage two, observing q 1 , q 2 , k 1 , and k 2 the firms set prices p i simultaneously. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Finally, observing both firms' qualities, CLIs, and prices, each customer decides on her optimal search strategy. Following convention, we assume that search is without replacement and with free recall. Here we also assume that the firms' CLIs, just like qualities and prices, are ex ante observable to customers. Indeed, the efficacy of many firms' experience centers (e.g., those of Apple) are well known. Some retailers are known for providing better in-store services than others. Prospective buyers can readily discern the extent of evaluation assistance through a seller's website, a telephone call, or word of mouth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Market-Covered Duopoly</head><p>Our main analysis focuses on the case wherein each customer purchases one of the goods. The market is covered when bq 2 − p 2 ≥ 2s, which holds in equilibrium when b is sufficiently high (see below). The market-not-covered case is postponed to §4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Customer Search</head><p>Each customer's optimal search strategy in our model is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weitzman (1979)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Weitzman (1979, p. 643)</ref> addresses the following general problem (which he calls "Pandora's problem"). A risk-neutral agent faces n closed boxes. Box i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains a reward of x i , which follows an independent distribution F i . It costs s i to open box i to learn its reward. 8 When search stops, the consumer collects the highest reward uncovered. In this setting, what is the optimal search and stopping rule?</p><p>In a majority of the extant search models, all boxes are identical and thus search sequence does not matter. As is already well known, search stops once the highest reward uncovered equals or exceeds a reservation price. The reservation price has the defining property that the agent is indifferent between accepting a reward equal to the reservation price and continuing to search.</p><p>Remarkably, when the boxes are different (each with its own reward distribution and search cost), <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weitzman (1979)</ref> shows that the optimal search policy still takes a reservation price form. Each box i's reservation price R i is uniquely defined by R i =</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">−s i + R i R i 0 dF i x i + R i x i dF i x i .</formula><p>The left-hand side (LHS) of this equation is a known reward R i , and its right-hand side (RHS) is the expected net surplus (net of search cost) from sampling box i. That is, when presented with a known reward R i , the agent is indifferent between accepting it and continuing to open box i. 9 Equivalently, R i x i − R i dF i x i = s i . The optimal search sequence is in descending order of reservation prices and search ends once the highest uncovered reward equals or exceeds the reservation price of every closed box (see <ref type="bibr">Weitzman 1979, pp. 646-647)</ref>.</p><p>In our current model, each customer's decision problem is a special case of that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weitzman (1979)</ref>. We consider two products (n = 2), each with three attributes: quality, price, and match. Whereas quality and price are costlessly observable, match is unknown and costly to observe. Therefore, each product's total value remains unknown and costly to observe.

The reason is as follows: Customers in 2 1 + b (in the number of 1 + b − p 1 − p 2 − a 1 − a 2 / q 1 − q 2 ) will first sample product 1, and customers in b 2 (in the number of p 1 − p 2 − a 1 − a 2 / q 1 − q 2 − b) will first sample product 2.

Consequently, the differences between the firms' market shares and prices enlarge when the high-end firm invests more, and shrink when the lowend firm invests more. Therefore, through making a greater CLI than the competitor the high-end firm reinforces its competitive advantage and the low-end firm alleviates its competitive disadvantage.</p></div>

Proposition 3 is rather strong as it does not depend on the production (c) or customer learning (h) technologies.</p><p>The rationale behind this is that the firms' relative investments in customer learning drive their demand elasticities of quality. Substituting p * 1 and p * 2 into (8) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) yields the firms' stage-one demand functions, which lead to 15</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">D 1 q 1 = −1 3 q 1 − q 2 • c q 1 − c q 1 − c q 2 q 1 − q 2 + s k 1 − k 2 q 1 − q 2 (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">D 2 q 2 = 1 3 q 1 − q 2 • c q 1 − c q 2 q 1 − q 2 − c q 2 − s k 1 − k 2 q 1 − q 2 (15) Note that c q 1 &gt; c q 1 − c q 2 / q 1 − q 2 &gt; c q 2 , since</formula><p>c is increasing and convex by assumption.

In either case, the firm investing less is strictly worse off than when neither firm invests, reflecting the competition effect of CLI. Proposition 5 is also consistent with the finding of Gu and Xie (2013) that when marginal production cost is constant over quality, the high-end firm has a stronger incentive to provide matching information than the low-end firm.</p><p>The intuition behind part (A) of Proposition 5 is as follows: When</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">c 1 − c 2 / q 1 − q 2 ≤ 1 + 2b /2, if</formula><p>the firms were to invest equally in customer learning, firm 1 would enjoy a higher marginal return from CLI than firm 2. 17 This would induce firms 1 and 2 to increase and decrease their CLIs, respectively. The intuition for part (B) is analogous. Part (A) of Proposition 5 resonates with the following observation: In industries where unit production costs do not increase significantly with quality (e.g., software, pharmaceuticals, and consumer electronics), firms with higher qualities often invest markedly more in customer learning (in the form of demonstration, detailing, and setting up experience centers, etc.) than their low-end counterparts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sequential Choice of CLI and Quality in the</head><p>Market-Not-Covered Duopoly Our baseline model considers a market-covered duopoly where the firms simultaneously choose product quality and CLI before competing in price. However, in industries with relatively short product life cycles (e.g., digital devices), firms sometimes invest in customer learning (e.g., setting up experience centers) before deciding on the quality of future generation products. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Therefore, to account for such scenarios we now examine a three-stage game wherein the firms choose CLI (k i ) in stage 1, quality (q i ) in stage 2, and price (p i ) in stage 3. In each stage, the firms observe each other's decisions in prior stages (if any) and act simultaneously. We analyze the market-notcovered case below and the market-covered case in §4.2. For tractability, in both cases we assume that c q = 0 for q ∈ q L q H , where 0 &lt; q L &lt; q H , and h k = k for k ∈ 0 k , where &gt; 0 and 0 &lt;k &lt; 1. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Again, suppose firm 1 chooses an equal or higher quality. When b is sufficiently close to zero, the customers with very low preference for quality do not purchase either good. We continue to focus on the scenario wherein some of the customers purchase their favorite products regardless of realized match. Clearly, the optimal decision rules of the customers in 3 1 + b remain identical to that in §3.1. To characterize optimal search by the remaining customers, we let</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">4 = p 2 q 2 and 5 = p 2 − a 2 q 2 (20)</formula><p>For the customers in 4 3 , the realized value of product 2 (even with a poor match) always exceeds <ref type="bibr">18</ref> We thank an anonymous reviewer for this observation. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Clearly, analysis of the three-stage game is not tractable with general production and customer-learning technologies because formulating the firms' stage-1 objectives requires explicit values of equilibrium product qualities in stage 2. With a general production technology, the stage-2 quality equilibrium can best be characterized with the firms' FOCs. the reservation price of product 1, i.e., q 2 − p 2 ≥ 0 (⇔ ≥ 4 ) and q 2 −p 2 &gt; q 1 +a 1 −p 1 (⇔ &lt; 3 ). Therefore, these customers will purchase product 2 regardless of realized match. The customers in 5 4 will sample product 2 and will purchase it only if it is a good match (</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">q 2 + r − p 2 + 1 − 0 − 1 − k 2 s ≥ 0 ⇔ q 2 + a 2 − p 2 ≥ 0</formula><p>). Note that when 3 &gt; 4 , a customer in 5 4 never samples product 1. 20 Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> depicts the pattern of market segmentation.</p><p>The demand function of product 1, D 1 , remains the same as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>).

The competition effect of CLI persists; either firm may increase its demand by investing more than its competitor in customer learning. Besides, CLI by firm 2 (the low-end firm) also creates a marketexpansion effect through inducing more low-end customers to sample (and purchase in case of a good match) its product. This is clear since 5 decreases in k 2 .</p><p>In the third stage, the firms observe each other's CLI k i and quality q i and set prices p i simultaneously to maximize their own revenue, R i = D i p i . The unique price equilibrium readily follows from the FOCs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">p * 1 = 1 4q 1 − q 2 • 2 1 + b q 1 q 1 − q 2 + 2q 1 − q 2 a 1 − q 1 a 2 (22) and p * 2 = 1 4q 1 − q 2 • 1 + b q 2 q 1 − q 2 − q 2 a 1 + 2q 1 − q 2 a 2 (<label>23</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">)</formula><p>When r is sufficiently low, a i is low (regardless of the firms' CLIs) and p * 1 &gt; p * 2 always holds.</p><p>20 When 3 &gt; 4 , 4 will not sample product 1, as 4 Proposition 6. Suppose q 1 &gt; q 2 . Firm 1's price is higher (lower) than when neither firm invests in customer learning if k 1 /k 2 ≥ &lt; q 1 / 2q 1 − q 2 . Firm 2's price is higher (lower) than when neither firm invests in customer learning if k 1 /k 2 ≤ &gt; 2q 1 − q 2 /q 2 . Proposition 6 contrasts with Proposition 1. In the market-covered duopoly, compared with when neither firm invests in customer learning, the prices remain unchanged under symmetric CLIs and move in opposite directions otherwise. When the market is not covered, both prices increase when the difference between their CLIs is relatively small (q 1 / 2q 1 − q 2 &lt; k 1 /k 2 &lt; 2q 1 − q 2 /q 2 ). In particular, with symmetric CLIs both prices will increase. The intuition is that symmetric CLIs do not directly affect the high-end firm's demand, but increases the low-end firm's demand due to the market-expansion effect, thus relaxing price rivalry. The equilibrium revenues are R</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">q 1 + r − p 1 + 1 − 0 − 1 − k 1 s &lt; 0 ⇔ p 1 q 2 − p 2 q 1 &gt; q 2 a 1 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_49">1 = p * 1 2 / q 1 − q 2 and R 2 = q 1 p * 2 2 / q 2 q 1 − q 2 .</formula><p>We now turn to the stage-2 quality competition. For the remainder of this subsection, we assume q L ≥ 4 7 q H , so that the feasible range of quality is not too broad. When s is not too high, the unique quality equilibrium involves maximum differentiation, i.e., q 1 = q H and q 2 = q L , regardless of the firms' stage-1 CLI decisions (see the online appendix for deduction). The intuition behind this is as follows: Because the unit cost is constant (normalized to zero) over quality, firm 1, the highend firm, naturally chooses the highest feasible quality. However, the low-end firm faces a trade-off in its quality choice. Choosing a lower quality helps mitigate the ensuing price rivalry, whereas choosing a higher quality increases its product's market appeal and hence demand. When the quality space is sufficiently narrow (q L ≥ 4 7 q H ), the former motive dominates the latter, leading to maximum differentiation.</p><p>In stage 1, the firms choose CLI k i . Firm i's period-1 objective function is i = R i q 1 = q H q 2 = q L − k i . Proposition 7. Suppose q L ≥ 4 7 q H and s is sufficiently low. In the unique SPE, q 1 = q H and q 2 = q L . (A) When the marginal cost of CLI ( ) is very low, both firms choose the maximum CLI,k. (B) When is intermediate and the expected match value is relatively high, firm 2, the lowend firm, investsk and firm 1 does not invest in customer learning. (C) When is intermediate and the expected match value is relatively low, firm 1, the high-end firm, investsk and firm 2 does not invest in customer learning. (D) When is sufficiently high, neither firm invests in customer learning. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Because each firm i's profit function is convex in k i , k i can only possibly take the extreme values Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 113-127, © 2016 INFORMS of 0 andk. Not surprisingly, both firms invest the maximum amountk when the marginal cost of CLI ( ) is sufficiently low (part (A)), and neither firm invests when is very high (part (D)). Asymmetric CLIs emerge for intermediate values of . When the expected match value is relatively high, the lowquality firm investsk but the high-quality firm does not invest (part (B)). When the expected match value is relatively low, the opposite CLI pattern occurs (part (C)).</p><p>The intuition behind parts (B) and (C) is as follows: An important horizontal attribute (as in part (B)) strengthens the market-expansion effect of CLI, which prompts the low-end firm to invest more aggressively. The outcome is as if the firms differentiate by specializing in different attributes: One firm does not invest in customer learning but chooses a high quality, whereas the other chooses the maximum CLI but a low quality. On the other hand, a relatively unimportant horizontal attribute (part (C)) weakens the market-expansion effect of CLI, which curtails the low-end firm's incentive to invest. In this case, the high-end firm strengthens its competitive advantage by investing more in customer learning. Just as in the market-not-covered duopoly, both firms invest the maximum amount k when is very low (part (A)) and will not invest at all when is very high (part (C)). When takes intermediate values (as in part (B)), the high-quality firm investsk whereas the low-quality firm does not invest at all in customer learning.</p><p>The high-end firm always invests equal or greater amounts in customer learning than the low-quality firm (part (D)), which contrasts with Proposition 7. In the market-not-covered duopoly, the market-expansion effect may prompt the low-quality firm to choose a strictly higher CLI than its rival to mitigate its competitive disadvantage. When the market is fully covered, the market-expansion effect of CLI vanishes and the insight from Proposition 4 applies: The firm with a higher relative production efficiency (here, the high-quality firm) invests more in customer learning than its competitor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The Effects of CLI on R&amp;D</head><p>In the basic model, the firms face zero fixed production costs and constant unit variable costs that increase in quality. For software and certain high tech goods, however, product quality is primarily driven by a firm's R&amp;D expenditure; unit variable costs need not increase with quality. We now consider this alternative cost structure and examine how the firms' CLIs affect their product qualities or R&amp;D efforts. Suppose that the feasible quality space is q , where q &gt; 0 is some minimum quality standard possibly imposed by regulation. The firms face an identical R&amp;D technology under which the costs of devising a product of quality q is g q , with g &gt; 0 and g &gt; 0. We assume that g 0 = 0, g 0 = 0, and lim q→ g q = , as in Lehmann-Grube (1997). Their common unit variable costs are constant and independent of quality, and are normalized to zero. We retain the rest of the set-up of the basic model and focus on the market-covered duopoly.</p><p>The subgame perfect equilibrium is derived in the online appendix, where we show that the low-end quality equals q, the lowest admissible quality, regardless of whether the firms invest in customer learning. The high-end quality is strictly lower than when neither firm invests in customer learning. This is because at the price equilibrium the low-end firm's marginal revenue in own quality is always negative (with or without CLI) and because the firms' CLIs lower the high-end firms' marginal revenue in own quality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The Full-Information Duopoly</head><p>We now consider a special case of the baseline model wherein each customer costlessly observes her match values with both products.

The firms' stage-1 profit functions are given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">12</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) with s = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">A Duopoly Without Quality Differentiation</head><p>Our main analysis has examined how CLI competition interacts with vertical differentiation. One may wonder about the strategic role of CLI in a setting with homogeneous quality. We now investigate a variant of the main model where the firms have an identical product quality, q 0 say. Because q 0 does not affect customer search, to ease exposition we normalize q 0 and the unit cost to zero.</p><p>Customers will sample product i only if r − p i + 1 − 0 − 1 − k i s ≥ 0. Therefore, R i = a i − p i ≥ 0 (i = 1 2) in equilibrium. Suppose product i has a higher reservation price than j, i.e., a i − p i &gt; a j − p j ≥ 0 (i j = 1 2, i = j). Then, all customers will first sample i, and will purchase i if it yields a good match (with probability ). A customer who realizes a poor match (with probability 1 − ) will proceed to sample j, and will purchase j if it yields a good match. Firm i's demand is thus and firm j's 1 − . This demand discontinuity implies that there is no purestrategy equilibrium in the stage-2 pricing game.</p><p>Proposition 9. Suppose the firms' CLIs satisfy 0 ≤ k 1 ≤ k 2 &lt; 1. The unique price equilibrium is in mixed strategies, and the firms' price distributions are</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">F 1 p 1 = 1 1 − a 2 − a 1 p 1 − a 1 − a 2<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">F 2 p 2 = 1 1 − 1 − a 1 p 2 + a 1 − a 2</formula><p>for 1 − a 1 ≤ p 1 ≤ a 1 and a 2 − a 1 &lt; p 2 &lt; a 2 . Firm 1's strategy has an atom at a 1 . The equilibrium revenues are R 1 = 1 − a 1 and R 2 = a 2 − a 1 .</p><p>The price equilibrium when k 1 &gt; k 2 is obtained by invoking symmetry. By construction, the firm investing more in customer learning has a higher a i . Proposition 9 shows that the firm with a greater CLI (here, firm 2) has more market power and collects higher revenue. Firm 2 prices more aggressively in that it prices below a 2 with probability one, whereas firm 1 places an atom at a 1 .</p><p>We now turn to the stage-1 competition in CLI. Without loss of generality, suppose firm 2 chooses an equal or higher CLI than firm 1. By Proposition 9, firm 1's stage-1 profit function is 1 k 1 = 1 − r − s + sk 1 − h k 1 and firm 2's 2 k 2 = r − s − 2 a 1 + sk 2 − h k 2 .</p><p>Proposition 10. (A) The unique SPE in CLI (after suppressing the firms' identities) is one firm choosing k L and the other k H , where 1 − s = h k L and s = h k H . (B) Both firms make higher profits than when neither firm invests in customer learning, and the firm choosing k H gains more from CLI. Interestingly, the ex ante symmetric firms always choose different levels of CLI. The reason is that choosing different CLIs helps relax price rivalry. Without quality differentiation, the products are ex ante homogeneous. If the firms choose the same CLI, their products would have an identical a i and, consequently, all customers would first sample the product with a lower price. This intensifies price rivalry as the firms have to compete on the basis of price alone.</p><p>The equilibrium CLIs are efficient provided there are no economies of scope in lowering the products' evaluation costs. To see this, a social planner offers both products at cost (normalized to zero) and minimizes the sum of customers' expected search costs and the CLI costs. The customers will first sample the product with a lower evaluation cost. In case of a poor match (with probability 1 − ), she proceeds to sample the other product. Suppose product 2 has a (weakly) lower evaluation cost. Without any spillover effects in lowering the products' evaluation costs, the social planner chooses k 2 and k 1 to minimize 1 − k 2 s + h k 2 + 1 − 1 − k 1 s + h k 1 . Clearly, the efficient CLIs are k H and k L .</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, CLI competition does not lead to a prisoner's dilemma, but instead increases both firms' profits. This is because prices are set before customers search in our model. When neither firm invests in customer learning, evaluation cost is high (at s) and firms must price sufficiently low (at or below a 0 = r − s/ ) to induce search. Through lowering evaluation costs, CLI allows the firms to raise prices while attracting customers to search, which leads to higher profits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>When resolution of match uncertainty requires costly evaluation, the first product sampled by the customer is more likely to make the sale. All else equal, customers will first sample the product with a lower evaluation cost. Therefore, firms invest strategically to ease product evaluation. In a duopoly, we have shown that such CLI has a significant impact on quality and price competition.</p><p>In a market-covered duopoly, CLI demonstrates a competition effect: By investing more than the competitor in customer learning, a firm increases its demand at the expense of the competitor. For given product qualities, the price of the firm with a greater CLI increases whereas the competitor's decreases relative to when neither firm invests. When the firms endogenize product quality and CLI, both qualities will decrease when the high-end firm invests more, increase when the low-end firm invests more, and remain unchanged when they invest equally, relative to when neither firm invests. The high-end firm Marketing Science 35(1), pp. 113-127, © 2016 INFORMS invests more in customer learning than the low-end firm when the former has a higher relative production efficiency, and the low-end firm invests more otherwise. In a market-not-covered duopoly, CLI by the low-end firm further introduces a market-expansion effect; some of the low-end customers who would not sample either product without CLI will now sample the low-end product. Interestingly, the marketexpansion effect may induce the low-end firm to invest more in customer learning than the high-end firm even when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency, especially when horizontal match is relatively important.</p><p>Our model has its limitations. First, the binary distribution of match value simplifies analysis, as each product's reservation price is a linear function of CLI. A more general distribution exacerbates complexity but may not add significant new insights. Second, we have considered a duopoly. Although the optimal search rule developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weitzman (1979)</ref> applies to any finite number of options, the demand derivation becomes much more complex if there are more than two competing products. Third, because welfare analysis in a vertical setting is generally not tractable, we are unable to identify the effects of CLI on consumer surplus or social welfare. In the special case of symmetric investments, equilibrium qualities and prices remain the same as when neither firm invests, even though more customers will search. Consumer surplus thus increases. Last, aside from product quality, CLI may also affect the other marketing-mix variables. A direction for future research is to examine the impacts of CLI on horizontal differentiation. One possible set-up is that each product consists of two horizontal attributes, one observable and the other not. The observable attribute and the customers exist along a Hotelling line. When customers incur an evaluation cost to discover their valuation of the other attribute (i.e., match), one may investigate how the firms' CLIs affect locations of the observable attribute.</p></div>
