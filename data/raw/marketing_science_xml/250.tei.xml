<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Scholars emphasize the importance of marketing by showing that as marketing investments increase, firm performance increases (e.g., <ref type="bibr">McAlister et al. 2007, Moorman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rust 1999)</ref>. However, stock market pressures may encourage firms to reduce their marketing investments to improve their short-term performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chakravarty and Grewal 2011)</ref>. This short-term emphasis is highlighted by Firepond, Inc., a provider of integrated e-business sales and marketing solutions that went public in 2000; to attract investor attention to its initial public offering (IPO), Firepond reduced its marketing investment (advertising and research and development (R&amp;D)) to 69% of revenue (thus increasing earnings) in 2000 compared to 97% of revenue it consistently spent in years prior to and after the IPO. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Because their valuations are driven primarily by earnings <ref type="bibr">Schwert 2004, Ritter 2011)</ref>, a firm that has decided to go public has incentives to try to boost its earnings to increase its IPO valuations.</p><p>Representing private firms' debut on the public stage, IPOs exert tremendous pressure on those firms to obtain favorable responses from investors <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ritter 2011)</ref>. Successful IPOs increase organizational reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brau and Fawcett 2006)</ref>, improve access to funding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chemmanur and Fulghieri 1999)</ref>, provide exit routes for initial investors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daily et al. 2003)</ref>, and have significant imprinting effects that shape organizations' evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fischer and Pollock 2004)</ref>. The desire for a successful IPO thus can motivate firms to engage in myopic marketing, as the Firepond example shows, by temporarily reducing their marketing investments to boost their current earnings. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal: Marketing Myopia and Initial Public Offerings Marketing Science 35(4), pp. 656-675, Â© 2016 INFORMS 657 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Graham et al. (2005)</ref> find that more than 80% of chief financial officers decrease discretionary expenses (advertising and R&amp;D) to meet capital market expectations, suggesting they are willing to sacrifice longer-term firm value for short-term gains. This reasoning aligns with emerging literature on marketing myopia that provides empirical evidence of how firms intentionally make unanticipated marketing cuts during seasoned equity offerings <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mizik and Jacobson 2007)</ref>, at the end of financial quarters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chapman and Steenburgh 2011)</ref>, and at the end of financial years <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Mizik 2010)</ref> to increase immediate earnings. Such cuts fail to consider that short-term gains can be more than offset by lower long-term shareholder returns. Thus, Firepond did exceedingly well during its IPO, but it significantly underperformed the market and its peers over time. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We seek to study the (potentially harmful) effects of these myopic cuts to marketing budgets during the IPO process, to gain a better understanding of their implications.</p><p>To study marketing myopia during the IPO process, we incorporate moderators that reflect firm-level heterogeneity. Because IPO firms by definition have limited track records, they create significant uncertainties, which IPO firms can address by providing more information about their resources and internal strategies <ref type="bibr">Yan 2009, Xiong and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Bharadwaj 2011)</ref>. For example, an IPO firm can access external resources if it possesses interfirm relationships that allow it to integrate its strategies and processes with those of partners (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Uzzi 1997)</ref>, such as strategic alliances or key customer relationships. Firms' internal strategies instead reflect their strategic emphasis on fundamental value creation and value appropriation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(March 1991)</ref>. Value creation implies a focus on upstream marketing activities, such as R&amp;D to create novel innovations, whereas value appropriation emphasizes downstream marketing activities, such as advertising new and existing products <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Mizik and Jacobson 2003)</ref>. Although firms can pursue several strategies, "choices must be made between gaining new information about alternatives and thus improving future returns [i.e., value creation], and using the information currently available to improve present returns [i.e., value appropriation]" <ref type="bibr">(March 1991, p. 72)</ref>. The extent to which firms emphasize value creation over value appropriation then may be critical for assessing organizational outcomes. Accordingly, our conceptual framework includes IPO firms' external relationships (i.e., strategic alliances and key customer relationships) and internal strategic emphasis.</p><p>To test this conceptual framework, we gather data from firms that went public during 2000-2011. This 12-year window is long enough to obtain a large sample (1,095 IPOs) and observe longer-term performance (i.e., three years after the IPO). With this unique data set, obtained from multiple sources, we apply robust econometric specifications to account for potential endogeneity of myopic marketing. We find that more than 37% of the firms in the sample engage in myopic marketing during their IPOs, in that they reduce their marketing investments to inflate their current earnings. Investors fail to discern this myopic behavior immediately and reward firms during their IPOs, which appears to justify such myopic marketing. However, firms that engage in myopic practices also have systematically lower longer-term performance. The extent to which investors penalize myopic firms depends on the external and internal moderators. The downside of myopic marketing increases with more strategic alliances and a strategic emphasis on value creation, but it decreases in the presence of key customer relationships.</p><p>These findings in turn advance literature on marketing resource allocation and IPOs. First, we show that myopic cuts in marketing spending, when unrelated to product market factors, exert a persistent, negative impact on shareholder value. Prior research demonstrates the existence and negative consequences of myopic marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chapman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Steenburgh 2011, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jacobson 2007)</ref>; we provide evidence about contingencies associated with its effects, involving factors both external and internal to the IPO firms. Second, our research contributes to IPO literature as we provide some resolution to the long-standing question of why IPO firms underperform relative to benchmarks after their IPO <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Ritter and Welch 2002)</ref>. Myopic marketing has significant effects on post-IPO performance and should be explicitly accounted for in any study that aims to examine longer-term IPO outcomes.</p><p>In the next section, we present out conceptual framework and then develop our hypotheses in Â§3. After we present our data and measures in Â§4 and analysis approach in Â§5, we detail the results in Â§6. In Â§7, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for both literature and practice.  measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cohen and Zarowin 2010)</ref>, it also prompted an upsurge in manipulations of marketing activities to attain short-term performance objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cohen et al. 2008)</ref>. Myopic marketing practices include accelerating sales by offering unanticipated promotions or credit terms or reducing marketing budgets to inflate current-period earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gunny 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, Roychowdhury 2006</ref>. Although research on the longer-term effects of myopic marketing continues to emerge, some evidence (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and the Web appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ mksc.2015.0970)) already indicates the harm of myopic marketing practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mizik and Jacobson (2007)</ref> show that myopic marketing actions during seasoned equity offerings result in stock underperformance by up to 39%, relative to matched counterparts, over four years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chapman and Steenburgh (2011)</ref> find that price promotions that run for a week and offer a 33% discount increase current quarterly revenues but result in postpromotion dips of about 7.5% of net income. Yet, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> indicates, there is a general paucity of research that identifies the contexts that motivate myopic marketing actions or the conditions that influence their short-and long-term consequences. Although myopic marketing actions are strategic managerial choices, designed to influence IPO outcomes, existing empirical research fails to account for their nonrandom, endogenous nature. Research that identifies contexts in which myopic marketing actions likely proliferate, as well as their consequences, can provide useful information to shareholders and regulators concerned with sustainable firm performance. For example, during an IPO, the short-term goal of attracting immediate investors is paramount <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lowry et al. 2010)</ref>, and its success typically is quantified by immediate payoffs, such as initial stock valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Pollock and Rindova 2003)</ref>. Such short-term goals may overshadow longer-term strategic concerns. An IPO also demands heavy resource commitments, as demonstrated by research across business disciplines, including finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ritter 2011)</ref>, accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ball and Shivakumar 2008)</ref>, economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Daines and Klausner 2001)</ref>, management <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen et al. 2008)</ref>, and marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Saboo and Grewal 2013)</ref>. Overall, this research focuses on two broad domains: drivers of short-term performance measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Ritter and Welch 2002)</ref> and the longer-term implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(PÃ¡stor et al. 2009)</ref>. Tandem investigations of short-and longer-term IPO outcomes are scarce, even though such joint investigations are essential to determine if actions geared toward influencing short-term outcomes have unintended consequences on longer-term results; that is, because information about pre-IPO earnings largely drives IPO valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Ritter and Welch 2002)</ref>, firms experience intense pressure to increase these earnings, which might lead them to engage in myopic marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Healy and Wahlen 1999)</ref>. Lowering expenditures prior to an IPO is an easy way to increase earnings, because firms are not legally bound to justify changes in their discretionary spending to stakeholders. Therefore, we study marketing myopia in the IPO context, an appropriate research setting to investigate whether firms engage in myopic marketing around IPOs and, if they do, what short-and longer-term implications result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Moderating Variables</head><p>The uncertainty surrounding IPO firms, because of their limited track records and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daily et al. 2003)</ref>, reduces investors' willingness to purchase an offering and lowers IPO valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Houge et al. 2001</ref>). To reduce this uncertainty, IPO firms can share information with prospective investors. In particular, they describe both their internal strategies and their access to external resources through their interfirm relationships. Strategic alliances and key customer relationships both constitute significant external ties. The firm's internal strategic emphasis on value creation or value appropriation also represents information that is valuable to investors. Because details about these external and internal factors help reduce uncertainty about the firms' inherent "worthiness" (Chemmanur and Yan 2009, Xiong and Bharadwaj 2011), IPO firms likely share this information during the IPO process, and the information in turn can influence managerial actions, including myopic actions. We accordingly consider strategic alliances, key customer relationships, and the internal strategic emphasis as critical moderators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Marketing Myopia</head><p>From an economic perspective, if firms are rational, forward-looking decision makers, myopic marketing makes little sense. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> By definition, such practices provide immediate benefits that dissipate in the long run.</p><p>However, the IPO context provides both an opportunity and a motivation for firms to be myopic. First, the scarcity of information about the IPO firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ritter 2011)</ref>, limited media coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Rao 1993)</ref>, and investors' tendency to overweight recent firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Coval and Shumway 2005)</ref> make the IPO process particularly susceptible to inflation of current earnings. This inflation makes IPO firms "look good," appear less risky, and seem worth a higher offer price <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Khokhar 2011)</ref>. A myopic marketing approach implies that firms reduce their marketing investments (advertising and R&amp;D budgets) to report higher cash flows and inflate current-period earnings. Because marketing investments are discretionary, any cuts can boost earnings without drawing much scrutiny. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Stein (1989)</ref> shows that incentives for myopic behavior increase with the importance of the current-period stock price. In an IPO, current-period performance largely determines the amount of capital raised. Because IPO firms seek high valuation from investors during their IPOs, we propose the following baseline hypothesis: 5</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1). Firms going public seek to inflate their current-period earnings through myopic marketing actions (cutting advertising and R&amp;D investments).</p><p>Investments in market-based assets might make firms less vulnerable to environmental threats and challenges, because these assets reduce cash flow volatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Srivastava et al. 1998)</ref>. Budgeting for advertising and R&amp;D activities thus is critical, because these investments create market-based assets such as innovative products and strong brands. Marketing investments can help the firm determine customers' current and potential needs; develop and execute sales, promotions, and service programs; design and develop superior products; and enhance customer trust and loyalty. Cutting these investments-when the cuts are unrelated to product market factors-instead might increase firms' vulnerability to environmental threats. It also could result in delayed product development cycles, slower product launches, increased price sensitivity, or unpredictable revenue streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kessler and Chakrabarti 1996)</ref>. After the IPO is complete and the adverse effects of the myopic marketing actions on cash flows begin to emerge, investors likely start correcting their initial evaluations and penalize the myopic firms. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2). Firms that engage in myopic marketing during IPOs earn lower stock returns after the IPO than firms that do not engage in such actions; that is, the stock prices of myopic firms drop more than those of nonmyopic firms.</p><p>thus create shareholder value <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Saboo and Grewal 2013)</ref>, it seems unlikely that discount rates would be steep. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Although we do not formally hypothesize it, we expect myopic marketing to benefit short-term IPO outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Moderating Effect of Strategic Alliances</head><p>Strategic alliances are "characterized by the commitment of two or more firms to reach a common goal entailing the pooling of their resources and activities" <ref type="bibr">(Teece 1992, p. 19)</ref>. Such alliances are popular means to acquire knowledge and other resources. Firms thus use alliances to transfer and absorb their partners' knowledge and to exploit complementarities in their knowledge, without losing their own distinctive base of specialized knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Grant and Baden-Fuller 2004)</ref>. For example, firms enter into cooperative technological alliances for R&amp;D and engineering to innovate; they join marketing alliances to undertake downstream activities such as sales, advertising, and distribution and stimulate demand <ref type="bibr">(Fang et al. 2015, Swaminathan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Moorman 2009)</ref>. Thus, alliances provide access to resources that the focal firm does not own and that are difficult to acquire otherwise. However, their benefits depend critically on the firm's ability to meet contractual obligations and nurture the goodwill of its alliance partners. Alliances demand maintenance, and working partnerships "have to be periodically renewed and reconfirmed or else they lose their efficacy" <ref type="bibr">(Adler and Kwon 2002, p. 22)</ref>. To make strategic alliances valuable and profitable, firms must proactively meet resource commitments and replenish their investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gundlach et al. 1995)</ref>. Marketing investments provide explicit demonstrations of firms' efforts to nurture their partnerships. For example, advertising spending encourages market adoption of new alliance products, and R&amp;D spending updates the available knowledge that can be used to advance technologies. Beyond their investments in developing and cultivating alliances, firms that invest in marketing activities should be better able to realize the potential benefits of those alliances.</p><p>However, when IPO firms engage in myopic marketing, they likely underinvest in activities that are important for alliance-based partnerships and then may not be able to realize the full benefits of the alliances. In turn, the opportunity costs of myopic marketing may increase when the firm has more alliances. Because strategic alliances seek to create joint value with partners, opportunistic actions, such as underinvestments, also might result in conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gargiulo and</ref><ref type="bibr">Benassi 2000, Koka and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Prescott 2002)</ref>. If the IPO firm's underinvestment in the alliance is visible to current and potential alliance partners, its abilities to both benefit from current alliances and create new ones likely diminish <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gulati 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Kogut 1989</ref>. These risks also increase with more alliances. Therefore, the chances of being sanctioned for myopic behavior, and the resulting post-IPO decline in firm valuation, should increase with more alliances, and we hypothesize the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3). As the number of strategic alliances increases, the effects of myopic marketing on post-IPO Marketing Science 35(4), pp. 656-675, Â© 2016 INFORMS stock corrections increases; that is, the negative effect of myopic marketing on post-IPO returns increases in magnitude with an increase in the number of strategic alliances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Moderating Effect of Key Customer</head><p>Relationships Customers are critical firm assets, especially for young firms subject to the liability of newness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bruderl and Schussler 1990)</ref>. Because they lack substantial resources and perceived legitimacy, new firms struggle to develop business relationships with new customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Stinchcombe 1965)</ref>. Strong ties with customers can alleviate risks, because close customers purchase large amounts regularly, are receptive to new products, and proactively offer product feedback, endorsements, referrals, and word of mouth to facilitate product adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jones and Sasser 1995)</ref>. Relationships with key customers also tend to be characterized by trust and intimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Heide 1994)</ref>, so they can withstand relationship variations, such as those due to temporary lapses in internal marketing spending. Even if an IPO firm engages in marketing myopia, knowledge inputs (i.e., resources) from these key customers may remain readily accessible. As sources of both tacit and factual knowledge, key customers thus help increase the productivity of existing marketing investments of IPO firms and lower their resource requirements. Thus, the presence of key customers can compensate for underinvestments in marketing, enabling firms to deliver strong results with similar or lower marketing investments. Therefore, the post-IPO decline in the valuation of firms that engage in myopic marketing should be lower in the presence, versus the absence, of key customers. Formally: Hypothesis 4 (H4). The effects of myopic marketing on post-IPO stock corrections are lower in the presence, as opposed to the absence, of key customer relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Moderating Effect of Strategic Emphasis</head><p>Finally, when the firm's strategic emphasis shifts toward value creation, relative to value appropriation, innovative activities, such as building technological proficiency, gain precedence over activities designed to create competitive barriers in the product market, such as image building <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Swaminathan et al. 2008)</ref>. As has been widely documented <ref type="bibr">(Lavie 2007, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Jacobson 2003)</ref>, value creation and appropriation activities both can produce firm value, but through different mechanisms.</p><p>Value creation (emphasis on R&amp;D) improves upstream activities, such as developing new products and improving existing products. With these activities, firms can extract rents by marketing products that meet changing market conditions and increase customer satisfaction through improved product quality. Value appropriation activities (emphasis on advertising) instead enhance downstream activities, such as creating entry barriers or decreasing price sensitivity. These activities enable firms to extract rents by establishing brand loyalty and purchase intentions and obtaining real-time market knowledge about competitive products and customer needs. From another perspective, value creation activities represent an internal (supply side) focus; value appropriation represents an external (demand side) focus. Both can produce long-term firm value. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> A priori, it is thus not apparent whether the negative performance consequences of marketing myopia will vary with the firm's strategic emphasis on value creation or value appropriation. We accordingly propose alternate hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5). When the firm's strategic emphasis on value creation, relative to value appropriation, increases, the negative effects of myopic marketing on post-IPO stock corrections diminish.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5alt). When the firm's strategic emphasis on value creation, relative to value appropriation, increases, the negative effects of myopic marketing on post-IPO stock corrections increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data and Measures</head><p>Our sample consists of firms that went public during 2000-2011 and had no public presence before that point (i.e., excluding spinoffs and firms whose parent company was already publicly listed). The 12-year sample window provides a sufficiently large sample (N = 1 095) and allows us to observe longer-term (three years) post-IPO performance. We obtained a list of first-time IPO firms from the SDC Platinum New Issues Database. In line with extant research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Murphy 2007, Luo 2008)</ref>, we eliminated rights issues, leveraged buyouts, equity carveouts, issues with proceeds of less than $1.5 million, and firms with excessive missing information. Merging this IPO information obtained from SDC with accounting information obtained from Compustat, Factset, and Capital IQ and stock returns data from the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data tapes, we derived a sample of 1,095 firms. For each firm, we manually collected pre-IPO financial information from its IPO prospectus and tracked its performance until 2014, resulting in an unbalanced panel data set with 10,926 firm-year observations. 4.1. Independent Variables 4.1.1. Detecting Myopic Marketing. To test our framework, we need to be able to identify firms that exhibit myopic behavior. In line with extant research, we classify firms as myopic if they report higher-thanexpected earnings along with lower-than-expected marketing expenses in the year of their IPO (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobson 2007, Roychowdhury 2006</ref>). 7</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Measuring Earnings Surprise and Abnormal</head><p>Marketing Expenses. We use return on assets (ROA) to assess earnings, and size-adjusted advertising and R&amp;D expenses to assess marketing expenses. The ROA series can be approximated well with a two-way (firm and time), fixed-effect, first-order autoregressive model. By including a lagged dependent variable, we control for past levels of ROA and other factors, including inertia, persistence, and different initial conditions that can predict future ROA <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mizik and Jacobson 2007)</ref>. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ROA it = ROA Ã ROA itâ1 + ROA t + ROA i + ROA it (1)</formula><p>where ROA it is the return on assets for firm i in period t, ROA itâ1 is the lagged value of the ROA series, ROA is the first-order autoregressive coefficient that captures persistence in the ROA series, ROA t is the time-fixed effect, and ROA i is the firm-fixed effect that accounts for time-invariant unobserved factors. Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is superior to alternate specifications. Simpler models (e.g., without fixed effects, random walk) fail to depict the series well, because the fixed effects get (incorrectly) absorbed in the error term.

We begin by first-differencing Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2) (i.e., subtracting their respective lagged values) to remove the fixed effects ROA i and MKT i :  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Greene 2003)</ref>. We create instruments to account for these correlations. Specifically, we use ROA itâ2 and ROA itâ3 to form instruments for ROA itâ1 . Similarly, we use MKT itâ2 and MKT itâ3 to form instruments for MKT itâ1 . Lagged values are valid, with the assumption that error terms are serially uncorrelated, such that E ROA it ROA itâ1 = 0 and E MKT it MKT itâ1 = 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arellano and Bond 1991)</ref>. We use a test developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arellano and Bond (1991)</ref> to verify this assumption.

We also consider a general method of moments estimation, which does not make any distributional assumptions and allows for consistent estimates of ROA and MKT .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Dependent Variables: IPO Outcomes</head><p>We measure short-term IPO outcomes using initial returns, which is a dominant measure in the IPO literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ljungqvist 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Ritter 2011</ref>) and has been used in prior marketing studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Saboo and Grewal 2013)</ref>. To evaluate longer-term consequences, we must compute abnormal stock returns over the longer term (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jain and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kini 1994, Teoh et al. 1998b</ref>). Traditional metrics (e.g., income, sales) are not appropriate for IPO firms, because balance sheet measures cannot capture their potential growth. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In line with extant literature, we instead use stock market-based measures to evaluate longer-term performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aggarwal et al. 2009</ref>). However, statistical tests based on commonly used benchmarks, such as market, three-factor, or four-factor models, suffer from severe misspecifications, because of the biases associated with new listings, rebalancing, and skewness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barber and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lyon 1997, Kothari and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Warner 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> To account for this "bad model problem," we apply a procedure outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barber and Lyon (1997)</ref>. We compute the buy-and-hold abnormal returns of a sample firm, relative to a control firm with a similar size and book-to-market ratio. This matched-pair buy-and-hold abnormal return (MPBHAR) approach offers several advantages: It is less susceptible to the new listing, rebalancing, and skewness biases, and long-horizon 10 Balance sheet measures (e.g., Tobin's Q, revenues, profits) are backward looking and do not capture the long-term value of organizational strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sheth and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharma 2001, Srinivasan et al. 2012)</ref>. We argue that the effects of myopic actions become evident only over multiple periods, so they cannot be captured effectively with balance sheet measures. Scholars in this domain use matched-pair buy-and-hold abnormal returns (or related) measures almost exclusively to assess the long-term influence of myopic actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mizik and Jacobson 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">, Shivakumar 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">, Teoh et al. 1998b</ref>), which supports our choice. 11 A new listing bias arises because sampled firms generally have a long postevent history of returns, whereas firms that constitute the index (or reference portfolio) are new firms that begin trading only subsequent to the event month. A rebalancing bias arises because the compound returns of a reference portfolio, such as an equally weighted market index, are typically calculated with an assumption of periodic (generally monthly) rebalancing, but the returns of sample firms are compounded without rebalancing. A skewness bias arises because long-run abnormal returns are positively skewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barber and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lyon 1997, Kothari and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Warner 1997)</ref>.</p><p>tests based on this approach are well specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobson 2007, Shivakumar 2000)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barber and Lyon (1997)</ref> recommend, the control firm for each sample firm comes from the same two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code and has a market value between 70% and 130% of that of the sample firm, as well as a book-to-market ratio that is closest to that of the sample firm. We calculate abnormal returns as the difference in returns between the sample firm and the control firm over a period of up to three years after the IPO <ref type="bibr">Warner 2008, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jacobson 2007)</ref>. A three-year window is common in studies investigating longer-term IPO outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Teoh et al. 1998a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Teoh et al. (1998a)</ref> argue that the incentives to maintain a high stock price likely persist in the years immediately after the IPO, because entrepreneurs cannot dispose of their personal holdings immediately, and firms face significant legal and reputational scrutiny, so any significant drop in earnings might trigger lawsuits. Moreover, underwriters engage in significant price-influencing activities after the IPO, to stabilize prices by stimulating demand or restricting supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aggarwal 2000)</ref>. Thus, the consequences of myopic marketing likely are not visible immediately after the IPO. A three-year window is both short enough for the effects to be attributed to IPO-related actions and long enough for the consequences of these actions to manifest <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Rajan and Servaes 1997)</ref>. In addition, after a three-year period, IPO firms are "seasoned" <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Rajan and Servaes 1997)</ref>, so extending the analysis could introduce significant survivorship biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jain and Kini 1994)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Model Specification</head><p>To test H1, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mizik and Jacobson (2007)</ref>, we measure abnormal marketing expenses (MKT it â MKT it ) and earnings surprises (ROA it â ROA it ), as in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) and (4). We then categorize the firms into four groups, depending on whether they report marketing and earnings that are higher or lower than expected. According to H1, the proportion of firms that simultaneously report higher expected earnings and lower expected marketing investments should increase in their IPO year, relative to firms in other groups. In addition, H2 suggests that firms that engage in myopic marketing during their IPO suffer inferior performance in the future and are penalized more than those that do not engage in such activities. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mizik and Jacobson (2007)</ref>, we estimate the following equation to test this hypothesis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">MPBHAR ik = 1 k I Group 1 + 2 k I Group 2 + 3 k I Group 3 + 4 k I Group 4 + MPBHAR ik (6)</formula><p>where MPBHAR ik is the k-period matched-pair buyand-hold abnormal return; I â¢ is the indicator function, k = 1, 2, and 3 years after IPO; and estimates of k provide measures of the returns associated with each group. From H2, our null hypothesis would be 1 k = 2 k = 3 k = 4 k = 0, where k = 1, 2, and 3. To test the moderating effects of strategic alliances, key customer relationships, and strategic emphasis (H3-H5), we also estimate the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">MPBHAR ik = MM ik MM + SA ik SA+ MMSA ik MM ÃSA + CR ik CR+ MMCR ik MM ÃCR+ SE ik SE + MMSE ik MM ÃSE + CTRL ik ÃCTRL+ ik (7)</formula><p>where MPBHAR it is the matched-pair buy-and-hold abnormal returns for firm i = 1 N in year k = 1, 2, and 3 after the IPO; SA, CR, and SE refer to strategic alliances, customer relationships, and strategic emphasis, respectively; and CTRL are the other control variables. With H3-H5, we predict that MMSA ik &lt; 0 and MMCR ik &gt; 0, but we are unsure about MMSE ik . The specification of Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) includes industry-quarter and year fixed effects, which means our estimates are "within industry"; that is, they control explicitly for unobserved variables that do not vary across firms in a given industry and quarter, such as seasonality, broad macroeconomic conditions, recessions, hot IPO periods, industry attractiveness, or business cycles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Endogeneity of Marketing Myopia</head><p>Our theoretical framework is based on the notion that firms want to enhance their IPO outcomes and therefore choose strategically to behave myopically, with the goal of enhancing their immediate IPO valuations. Unobservable factors (e.g., resources, capabilities) could influence both the decision to behave myopically and IPO outcomes, which would make myopia endogenous. To correct for this potential bias, we use a dummy endogenous variable model <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Vella and Verbeek 1999)</ref>, also known as a treatment effects model <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Heckman 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Maddala 1983</ref>. It is a special case of the Heckman selection model, in which the outcome is observed for the entire sample, not just entities that received the "treatment," as in the case of a selection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Madureira and Underwood 2008)</ref>. This model has been widely used in finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Madureira and Underwood 2008)</ref>, economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Vella and Verbeek 1999)</ref>, and marketing (Ghosh and John 2009). 13</p><p>13 The treatment effect model, which includes the endogenous dummy variable as an independent regressor, is distinct from the sample selection model, which estimates the regression on a subsample of observations (for detailed discussions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Guo and Fraser 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Lennox et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Li and Prabhala 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">, Tucker 2010</ref>). The fundamental challenge of treatment effect models is that we cannot observe all of the information that managers use in their decision To implement the model, we used a two-step procedure. The first stage involves a probit model of the incidence of myopic marketing, and z MM i captures exogenous variables that influence the organizational choice to engage in myopic management during the IPO. Therefore, we include firm-level variables (ROA, total assets, marketing intensity, technological intensity, number of alliances, total employees, number of patents, firm age, number of board executives), market conditions (short-term, whether the firm went public during a bubble), IPO-specific factors (underwriter reputation, venture funding), and industry variables (market turbulence, technological turbulence, competitive intensity) to predict the firm's decision to engage in myopic marketing. The first-stage probit model specification is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">MM * i = z MM i MM + MM i (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where MM * i denotes a latent measurement with an observed binary response indicator MM i = I MM * i &gt; 0 , MM is the unknown parameter vector, and the random error MM i is assumed to be normally distributed. In a second step, we use the estimates of MM from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">8</ref>) and the resultant estimates of z MM i MM to compute the inverse Mills ratio (correction term, IMR) for each observation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">IMR = ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ z MM i MM z MM i MM if MM = 1, â z MM i MM 1 â z MM i MM if MM = 0 (9)</formula><p>where and are the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, respectively.</p><p>We include the correction term (IMR) in Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) to estimate the final model. To identify second-stage parameters, in line with the exclusion restrictions proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Maddala (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hausman (1978)</ref>, we drop ROA, technological intensity, marketing intensity, number of employees, and board executives from our final model. 14 These variables satisfy the requirements of both relevance and exogeneity, supporting making. For any given firm, we observe the outcome of a choice but not the outcomes of unmade choices. This missing information may result in a selection bias due to observables, such that we would fail to control for differences that can be observed (e.g., firm size, age), or it could prompt a selection bias due to unobservables due to the failure to account for differences that are unobserved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Heckman (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lee (1978)</ref> discuss selection bias due to unobservables and propose a two-step approach, in which the treatment choices are binary and the outcomes of the treatment depend on the combination of observable and unobservable factors. This approach requires estimating a choice model in the first stage and a bias correction term (i.e., IMR) in the second stage; it is a standard approach to correct for the endogeneity of binary variables due to unobservables <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Vella and Verbeek 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Although the model can be identified by the nonlinearity of the correction term (IMR), using the exclusion restriction reduces our reliance on the functional form for identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Greene 2003</ref>   their exclusion (i.e., they do not have direct effects on our dependent variable, but have some power to explain myopic activities). Short-term measures, such as pre-IPO returns (ROA) or pre-IPO marketing and technological investments, should influence the decision to behave myopically (relevance), but are less likely to influence returns (MPBHAR) three years after the IPO, because they change over time (exogeneity). Similarly, the numbers of employees or board executives may constrain managers' ability to reduce investments in critical organizational activities arbitrarily, but they cannot explain post-IPO returns on their own. (We also include other size-related measures in the second stage.)

The results in Table <ref type="table">6</ref> affirm H1, because in the year of their IPO, 37.22% of firms belong to Group 2, compared with only 28.47% in years when no IPO was offered, and this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0 01). 15 </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ROA it â ROA it &gt; 0 Group 2 MKT it â MKT it &lt; 0 402 (37.22%) 1 671 (28.47%) ROA it â ROA it &gt; 0 Group 3 MKT it â MKT it &gt; 0 315 (29.17%) 1 627 (27.74%) ROA it â ROA it &lt; 0 Group 4</formula><p>MKT it â MKT it &lt; 0 189 (17.50%) 698 (11.93%)</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ROA it â ROA it &lt; 0</formula><p>Notes.

These findings are reasonable. The amount of public information and post-IPO scrutiny increases with greater firm size and age, so larger, older firms become less likely to engage in myopic behaviors. Firms that value marketing investments also are less likely to reduce those investments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Myopic Marketing and Short-Term IPO</head><p>Outcomes In line with extant research, we look at IPO outcomes at the end of the first trading day to evaluate the short-term implications of myopic marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Ritter and Welch 2002)</ref>. We use initial returns, the most widely adopted measure to evaluate short-term IPO outcomes. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Initial returns also are referred to as underpricing; they reflect the percentage difference between the offer price at which the stock was offered to investors and the first-day closing price <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daily et al. 2003)</ref>. They also are associated with pre-IPO excitement <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Staikouras and Tsatsanis 2004</ref>). An enthusiastic response, in the form of a high first-day bump in the stock price, tends to yield other benefits, such as media attention, interest among potential customers, and analyst coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Demers and Lewellen 2003)</ref>. To calculate initial returns, we used the first-day closing price obtained from the CRSP and the offer price obtained from SDC.

The coefficients of the control variables are in the expected directions. Upward revisions of the offer price (partial adjustment) and good market conditions (bubble) positively influence initial returns. By contrast, a competitive environment (competitive intensity) hurt initial returns. Although investors should be able to discern myopic behavior from the financial statements, because IPO firms are required to report their past earnings, they  appear to overweight recent financial performance and reward myopic managers at the time of their IPO listing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Myopic Marketing and Longer-Term IPO Outcomes</head><p>To test for the longer-term implications of myopic behavior (H2), we report estimates for Equation (6) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref>. These estimates provide support for H2; firms engaging in myopic marketing management (Group 2) have significantly lower returns after their IPO. No such negative stock returns are observed for groups that do not engage in myopic marketing. One year after the IPO, myopic firms (Group 2) underperform their matched counterparts by â28%. Two years later, they underperform by â41%, and the three-year cumulative return shows a difference of â30%. 17 All of the differences are statistically significant and confirm our hypothesis that IPO firms pay penalties for their myopic behavior in the longer term. 18</p></div>

The significant negative coefficient for the interaction between myopic marketing and strategic alliance ( = â0 132, p &lt; 0 001) also affirms H3: Strategic alliances enhance the negative effects of myopic marketing (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The significant positive coefficient for the interaction of myopic marketing and key customer relationships ( = 0 571, p &lt; 0 01) also supports H4. Key customers buffer firms from the negative consequences of myopic marketing (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Strategic emphasis (SE) on value creation relative to value appropriation has a significant positive effect <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Results from an estimation without the endogeneity correction procedure provided qualitatively identical insights, offering confidence in our results. We also explored other variables that may be endogenous, with the objective of finding variables that exhibit "first order endogeneity" <ref type="bibr">(Rossi 2014, p. 655)</ref> and correct for them.

The results remained similar.

We thank the associate editor for suggesting this analysis.</p><p>( = 0 039, p &lt; 0 01) on cumulative three year post-IPO buy-and-hold abnormal returns. However, our results for strategic emphasis indicate a significant negative interaction ( = â0 052, p &lt; 0 01), such that an emphasis on value creation, relative to value appropriation, intensifies the deleterious effects of myopic marketing. Value creation activities have a longer-term payoff and typically rely on sustained investments. The speed of execution is a primary mechanism for small IPO firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen and Hambrick 1995)</ref>, so underinvestment in value creation activities and resulting delays in product development may render existing investments less useful; that is, such strategies provide competitors time to catch up and develop their own products, making it difficult for young IPO firms to attract customers.</p><p>The coefficients for the control variables are also in the expected directions. Short-term IPO outcomes (i.e., initial returns) have significant positive effects on longer-term returns, in line with the attention benefits of enthusiastic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Demers and Lewellen 2003)</ref>. Longer-term abnormal returns decrease with firm size (TA) and firm age, but increase with net income during the IPO. Larger size and greater age often lead to structural inertia, making it difficult for the firm to compete with rivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Audia and Greve 2006)</ref>. Profitability (net income) instead indicates the presence of resources that foster the firm's abilities to defend against competitive moves and environmental turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cestone and Fumagalli 2005)</ref> and thus protect investor wealth in the long run. The IPO firms that benefited from irrational exuberance during the bubble period or hot markets report inferior post-IPO performance, in the form of poor longer-term abnormal returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Coakley et al. 2007</ref>). Underwriter reputation relates positively to long-term abnormal returns. Underwriters have their reputations to protect, and those with strong reputations likely are more informed about the quality of an IPO. These reputed underwriters may actively discourage manipulative behavior that conflicts with shareholders' interest, to avoid the threat of future litigation (Lee and Masulis 2011). Finally, IPO firms benefit from market turbulence, which is in line with prior studies that highlight that changes in consumer preferences offer an opportunity for IPO firms to gain influence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Srinivasan et al. 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Alternative Explanation: Are Myopic Firms Low</head><p>on Cash? Underinvestment in marketing might not be deliberate; that is, firms exhibiting myopic behavior might be low on cash, such that they simply cannot invest in marketing activities. To rule out this alternate explanation, we compare the cash flow (using Compustat measures of cash and short-term investments, CHE) against the positions of myopic firms (Group 2) and others (Groups 1, 3, and 4) but find no significant difference. On average, firms engaging in myopic marketing exhibit cash flows similar to those that do not engage. We also computed the proportion of firms with positive versus negative size-adjusted cash flow surprises during their IPOs; that is, we estimated the difference between observed size-adjusted cash flows and those predicted from a time-series model, analogous to the one in  Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>). Again, we found no support for the alternate explanation that myopic firms are cash constrained. Rather, underinvestment in marketing appears deliberate, in line with our theorization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Post-IPO Operating Performance</head><p>The values of the MPBHAR provide strong support for our theory that underinvestment in marketing expenses hurts post-IPO performance, assessed using stock market-based measures. To understand the drivers of post-IPO stock market underperformance, we also assessed the consequences of myopic marketing on an operating performance measure. Specifically, we compared the post-IPO ROA of myopic firms with the ROA of other groups. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">11</ref> suggest that myopic firms realized a significantly lower ROA than other firms, starting in the first year after their IPO (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). 21 Thus, myopic marketing significantly lowers firm profitability and results in serious underperformance in future periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>Consistent with our theorizing, the IPO setting seems to encourage firms to engage in myopic marketing practices and rewards them for this myopic behavior during the IPO. However, firms are penalized in the longer term for their myopic marketing. The presence (versus absence) of key customers can compensate for myopic practices, but the deleterious effects of myopic marketing worsen with the number of strategic alliances the IPO firm has. A strategic emphasis on value creation, relative to value appropriation, also enhances the negative longer-term effects of myopic marketing. These theoretically grounded findings have implications for both theory and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Implications for Theory</head><p>In prior resource allocation literature, the adverse performance consequences of myopic marketing have been established in several contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chapman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Steenburgh 2011, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jacobson 2007)</ref>. However, in none of these contexts have researchers established the possibility that the consequences of myopic marketing could vary due to firm heterogeneity (i.e., in their external resources and internal strategy). We contribute to this theory by investigating the boundary conditions of the impact of marketing myopia. These consequences clearly could be masked or aggravated, depending on how well firms can deploy their resources and strategies when they manage fundamental activities such as advertising and R&amp;D myopically. Specifically, we find that key customer relationships can strengthen organizational defenses against temporary variations in marketing expenses (which otherwise might disrupt product development or weaken customer equity). This result also highlights the importance of customer-relevant constructs, such as customer satisfaction and loyalty, for IPO firms. By contrast, firms with many strategic alliances are bound by resource sharing contracts, so shortages lead to disruptions. In particular, myopic marketing weakens the firm's defensive capabilities, because of its disruption of the constructive output coming from strategic alliances. Thus, we highlight a contrast between two sources of external resources-strategic alliances and key customer relationships-and accordingly caution against research that combines these sources. Key customer relationships, unlike strategic alliances, fortify organizational defenses against variations in marketing spending. We also note the differential effects of an emphasis on value creation or value appropriation on performance outcomes. Extant literature recognizes the importance of both strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobson 2003, Swaminathan et al. 2008)</ref> but does not offer clear guidelines to help firms strategically increase resource allocations to one process or the other. We take a step toward creating such guidelines by highlighting the relative superiority of downstream value-appropriating activities in fortifying organizational defenses, especially in an IPO setting. If IPO firms have limited slack, they may be better off emphasizing value-appropriating processes, such as investing in customer relationships with shorter payback periods, and diminishing their focus on value-creating processes, such as building new knowledge that requires a longer payback period. Group 2 (Myopic)</p><p>Groups 1, 3, and 4</p><p>Notes. The figure compares the performance (market value) of one portfolio comprising myopic firms with one that does not include myopic firms. Results indicate that $100 invested in myopic firms is worth only $70 after three years, compared with $98.20 for firms that do not engage in myopic activities.</p><p>For IPO literature, we provide some resolution to the long-run underperformance puzzle, in which firms do well during their IPO but underperform relative to benchmarks thereafter <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Ritter 1991)</ref>. Firm actions during the IPO, such as myopic marketing, have significant effects on their post-IPO performance and should be explicitly accounted for in any examination of long-run IPO outcomes. In particular, investors adjust their expectations and penalize stocks once the consequences of myopic management are realized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Implications for Practice</head><p>With their short-term desires to enhance their IPO outcomes, IPO firms may be tempted to report high earnings by lowering their marketing investments, because such reductions are legal and seem harmless.</p><p>Our study provides compelling evidence that this approach is highly counterproductive. Myopic IPO firms miss out on the longer-term value produced by marketing investments and fail to realize the true potential of other, complementary investments (e.g., strategic alliances). Firms that engage in myopic marketing perform significantly worse than others, including those that honestly report poor earnings during their IPO. By empirically showing the negative effects of myopic marketing, we hope to sensitize IPO firms to the consequences of their actions.</p><p>This study also provides guidance to investors, who appear to overweight recent financial performance when valuing IPO firms. These overweighting effects are economically significant: Valuations of myopic firms are 30% less than valuations of firms that did not engage in myopic marketing. Consider two investors that invest $100 in IPOs. Investor A invests in myopic stocks (Group 2), but Investor B invests in stocks belonging to Groups 1, 3, and 4. Three years after the IPOs, Investor A's portfolio is worth $70, whereas Investor B's is worth $98.20 (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These effects also vary with the moderators we have addressed, as the statistical significance of our interaction results reveals.</p><p>Consider some real-world examples: Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., engaged in myopic marketing and had key customer relationships; it experienced a negative three-year MPBHAR of â5%. Targacept, Inc., also engaged in myopic marketing and was similar to Achillion, but it did not have any major customers, and its three-year MPBHAR was â13%. Two other firms also both engaged in myopic activities and were similar, but Jive Software, Inc., which had no strategic alliances, experienced a negative three-year MPBHAR of â84%, whereas Solazyme, Inc., with its seven strategic alliances, suffered a value of â151%. These examples are just anecdotal, but they align with our rigorous approach and vividly reveal the need for investors to recognize that myopic marketing can destroy firm value, so they should try to identify such practices during the IPO process.</p></div>

Third, we examine a subset of factors that influence myopic activities. Other boundary conditions may influence the consequences of myopic actions too. Structural models might specify the investments required at a later stage to compensate for previous myopic cuts.</p><p>Another research avenue could investigate the drivers of myopic activities and then identify governance structures to mitigate them. Scholars might consider the roles of different factors, such as top management team composition, compensation structures, other institutions (e.g., venture capitalists), or key customer constructs (e.g., customer satisfaction, brand equity, customer focus), in driving myopic behavior. Considering the negative consequences of myopic activities, such research would help public policy experts, regulators, and shareholders design valuable and appropriate controls to minimize the managerial incentives to engage in such activities.</p></div>
