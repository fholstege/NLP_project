<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>B randing has emerged as a top management priority in the last decade due to the growing realization that brands are one of the most valuable intangible assets that firms have. Driven in part by this intense industry interest, academic researchers have explored a number of different brand-related topics in recent years, generating scores of papers, articles, research reports, and books. This paper identifies some of the influential work in the branding area, highlighting what has been learned from an academic perspective on important topics such as brand positioning, brand integration, brand-equity measurement, brand growth, and brand management. The paper also outlines some gaps that exist in the research of branding and brand equity and formulates a series of related research questions. Choice modeling implications of the branding concept and the challenges of incorporating main and interaction effects of branding as well as the impact of competition are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Brands serve several valuable functions. At their most basic level, brands serve as markers for the offerings of a firm. For customers, brands can simplify choice, promise a particular quality level, reduce risk, and/or engender trust. Brands are built on the product itself, the accompanying marketing activity, and the use (or nonuse) by customers as well as others. Brands thus reflect the complete experience that customers have with products. Brands also play an important role in determining the effectiveness of marketing efforts such as advertising and channel placement. Finally, brands are an asset in the financial sense. Thus, brands manifest their impact at three primary levels-customer market, product market, and financial market. The value accrued by these various benefits is often called brand equity.</p><p>Our primary goal in this paper is to both selectively highlight relevant research on building, measuring, and managing brand equity and to identify gaps in our understanding of these topics. We put considerable emphasis on the latter and suggest numerous areas of future research. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Five basic topics that align with the brand-management decisions and tasks frequently performed by marketing executives are discussed in detail: (1) developing brand positioning, (2) integrating brand marketing, (3) assessing brand performance, (4) growing brands, and (5) strategically managing the brand. We then consider the implications of this work for choice models. Finally, we present a simple framework for integrating the customer-market, product-market, and financial-market level impact of brands and how the brand is created and developed by company actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Branding Decisions and Tasks</head><p>Developing Brand Positioning Brand positioning sets the direction of marketing activities and programs-what the brand should and should not do with its marketing. Brand positioning involves establishing key brand associations in the minds of customers and other important constituents to differentiate the brand and establish (to the extent possible) competitive superiority <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Keller et al. 2002)</ref>. Besides the obvious issue of selecting tangible product attribute levels (e.g., horsepower in a car), two areas particularly relevant to positioning are the role of brand intangibles and the role of corporate images and reputation. exhaustive review of the academic literature on brands and brand management, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Keller (2002)</ref>.</p><p>Brand Intangibles. An important and relatively unique aspect of branding research is the focus on brand intangibles-aspects of the brand image that do not involve physical, tangible, or concrete attributes or benefits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Levy 1999)</ref>. Brand intangibles are a common means by which marketers differentiate their brands with consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Park et al. 1986</ref>) and transcend physical products <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Kotler and Keller 2006)</ref>. Intangibles cover a wide range of different types of brand associations such as actual or aspirational user imagery; purchase and consumption imagery; and history, heritage, and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Keller 2001)</ref>. A number of basic research questions exist concerning how brand tangibles and intangibles have their effects.</p><p>Research Questions 1. In developing brand equity, what is the role of product performance and objective or tangible attributes versus intangible image attributes?</p><p>2. Are intangible attributes formative (causes) or reflective (constructed) reasons for equity or choice? That is, are they considered a priori or "constructed" after experience with the brand?</p><p>3. When and to what extent does recall of pleasant images (or "hot" emotions) shield a brand from less positive or even negative cognitive information?</p><p>4. How much of brand equity is tied to unique attributes of a product? What happens when competitors copy these attributes?</p><p>5. Which attribute associations are most stable and beneficial to a brand over the long run (e.g., "high quality" and "upscale") and which have limited useful life (e.g., being "hip")?</p><p>6. Can brands be thought of as simply a judgment bias or in terms of context effects in consumer decision making? What implications do these perspectives have for brand-equity measurement and valuation? Brand Personality.  examined the personalities attributed to U.S. brands and found they fall into five main clusters: (1) sincerity, (2) excitement, (3) competence, (4) sophistication, and (5) ruggedness.  found that three of the five factors also applied to brands in both Japan and Spain, but that a "peacefulness" dimension replaced "ruggedness" both in Japan and Spain, and a "passion" dimension emerged in Spain instead of "competency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">" Aaker (1999)</ref> also found that different brand personality dimensions affected different types of people in different consumption settings. She interpreted these experimental results in terms of a "malleable self," which is composed of self-conceptions that can be made salient by a social situation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Graeff 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Graeff , 1997</ref>. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Azoulay and Kapferer (2003)</ref> have challenged the conceptual validity of this particular brand personality scale, the anthromorphism of a brand is common in both casual consumer conversation (e.g., "that brand is 'hip' ") and advertising messages.</p><p>Research Questions 1. How does brand personality affect consumer decision making? Under what circumstances?</p><p>2. Is brand personality of more strategic or tactical (e.g., in terms of the "look and feel" of ad executions) importance?</p><p>3. What is the value of the different personality dimensions? Are certain personality dimensions more valuable at driving preference or loyalty than others? Does the value vary by product category or by other factors?</p><p>4. How stable are these various personality dimensions and what causes them to evolve or change? How does this stability compare to the stability of other types of brand associations?</p><p>Brand Relationships. Research has also explored the personal component of the relationship between a brand and its customers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Fournier (1998)</ref> examined the nature of relationships that customers haveas well as want to have-with companies (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Fournier and</ref><ref type="bibr">Yao 1997, Fournier et al. 1998</ref>). Fournier views brand-relationship quality as multifaceted and consisting of six dimensions beyond loyalty or commit ment along which consumerbrand relationships vary: (1) self-concept connection, (2) commitment or nostalgic attachment, (3) behavioral interdependence, (4) love/passion, (5) intimacy, and (6) brand-partner quality. She suggests the following typology of metaphors to represent common customer-brand relationships: (1) arranged marriages, (2) casual friends/buddies, (3) marriages of convenience, (4) committed partnerships, (5) best friendships, (6) compartmentalized friendships, (7) kinships, (8) rebounds/avoidance-driven relationships, (9) childhood friendships, (10) courtships, (11) dependencies, (12) flings, (13) enmities, ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) secret affairs, and (15) enslavements.</p><p>While this typology contains most positive relationships, it may overlook a range of possible negative (e.g., adversary) and neutral (e.g., trading partner) ones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Aaker et al. (2004)</ref> conducted a two-month longitudinal investigation of the development and evolution of relationships between consumers and brands. They found that two factors-experiencing a transgression and the personality of the brand-had a significant influence on developmental form and dynamics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Aggarwal (2004)</ref> explored how relationship norms varied for two types of relationships: exchange relationships, in which benefits are given to others to get something back, and communal relationships, in which benefits are given to show concern for others' needs.</p><p>Research Questions 1. How can a customer's desired relationship be determined? Have concerns over privacy and the increased use of customer data by firms resulted <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 740-759, © 2006 INFORMS</ref> in customers wanting more anonymous, transactional relationships, or do customers still desire close relationships with companies? Does personalization of communication make customers feel empowered and/or valued, or do they feel more exploited?</p><p>2. How can a desired customer relationship be cultivated by the company through marketing activities? How do different types of marketing activities such as advertising, customer service, and online resources combine to affect customer relationships?</p><p>3. In a world where information is widely shared and discrimination is seen as bad, should a firm deal differently with customers who desire different relationships? Can customer relationships be segmented and can customers who desire different types of relationships be identified? Does this vary by product category or by competing product benefits?</p><p>4. What is the relative profitability of different types of customer relationships? Should some customers be encouraged and others discouraged or "fired?" Alternatively, are there systematic ways to migrate unprofitable customers into profitable relationships?</p><p>Brand Experience. Experiential marketing is an important trend in marketing thinking. Through several books and articles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Schmitt (1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Schmitt ( , 2003</ref> has developed the concept of customer experience management (CEM), which he defines as the process of strategically managing a customer's entire experience with a product or company. According to Schmitt, brands can help to create five different types of experiences:</p><p>• Sense experiences involving sensory perception;</p><p>• Feel experiences involving affect and emotions;</p><p>• Think experiences which are creative and cognitive;</p><p>• Act experiences involving physical behavior and incorporating individual actions and lifestyles; and</p><p>• Relate experiences that result from connecting with a reference group or culture.</p><p>Research Questions 1. What are the different means by which experiences affect brand equity? How can firms ensure that experiences positively impact brand equity? More specifically, how can advertising trigger positive experiences with a brand or make negative ones less salient or influential?</p><p>2. How much of brand-related experiences are under the control of the company? How can they be effectively controlled?</p><p>3. When and to what extent do customers respond-positively or negatively-to attempts to control their experiences? How do customers make attributions about company actions and attitudes toward control of experiences? 4. How does the recognition or realization of company involvement impact brand experiences? Can brand identification facilitate experiences? How much does product placement (e.g., in movies) impact brand equity and how enduring is such equity?</p><p>5. How can a firm take advantage of unusual circumstances such as when the brand is associated with a positive event? How can a firm minimize the impact of being associated with a negative event (e.g., a spokesperson behaving badly)?</p><p>Corporate Image and Reputation. Corporate image has been extensively studied in terms of its conceptualization, antecedents, and consequences (see reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Biehal and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Sheinin 1998 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Dowling 1994)</ref>. Corporate brands-versus product brands-are more likely to evoke associations of common products and their shared attributes or benefits, people and relationships, and programs and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Barich and Kotler 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Several empirical studies show the power of a corporate brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Argenti and Druckenmiller 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Brown and Dacin (1997)</ref> distinguish between corporate associations related to corporate ability (i.e., expertise in producing and delivering product and/or service offerings) and those related to corporate social responsibility (i.e., character of the company with regard to societal issues), such as treatment of employees and impact on the environment. <ref type="bibr">Aaker (1992, 1998)</ref> define corporate credibility as the extent to which consumers believe that a company is willing and able to deliver products and services that satisfy customer needs and wants (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Erdem and Swait 2004)</ref>. They showed that successfully introduced brand extensions can lead to enhanced perceptions of corporate credibility and improved evaluations of even quite dissimilar brand extensions. They also showed that corporate marketing activity related to product innovation produced more favorable evaluations for a corporate brand extension than corporate marketing activity related to either the environment or, especially, the community (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Gürhan-Canli and Batra 2004</ref>). In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Bhattacharya and Sen (2003)</ref> extended the thinking on consumer-brand relationships to consider consumercompany relationships, adopting a social identity theory perspective to argue that perceived similarity between consumer and company identities play an important role in relationship formation.</p><p>Research Integrating Brand Marketing A variety of branding and marketing activities can be conducted to help achieve the desired brand positioning and build brand equity. Their ultimate success depends to a significant extent not only on how well they work singularly, but also on how they work in combination, such that synergistic results occur. In other words, marketing activities have interaction effects among themselves as well as main effects and interaction effects with brand equity. Three noteworthy subareas of this topic are the brandbuilding contribution of brand elements, the impact of coordinated communication and channel strategies on brand equity, and the interaction of companycontrolled and external events.</p><p>Integrating Brand Elements. Brands identify and differentiate a company's offerings to customers and other parties. A brand is more than a name (or "mark"). Other brand elements such as logos and symbols (Nike's swoosh and McDonalds' golden arches), packaging (Coke's contour bottle and Kodak's yellow and black film box), and slogans (BMW's "Ultimate Driving Machine" and VISA's "It's Everywhere You Want to Be") play an important branding role as well.</p><p>A number of broad criteria are useful for choosing and designing brand elements to build brand equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Keller 2003)</ref>: (1) memorability, (2) meaningfulness, (3) aesthetic appeal, (4) transferability (both within and across product categories and across geographical and cultural boundaries and market segments), (5) adaptability and flexibility over time, and (6) legal and competitive protectability and defensibility. Brand elements vary in their verbal versus visual content and product specificity. Although a robust industry exists to help firms design and implement these various brand elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kohli and LaBahn 1997)</ref>, comparatively little academic research attention, even in recent years, has been devoted to the topic of designing and selecting brand elements other than brand names.</p><p>Brand name properties have been studied extensively through the years. For example, researchers studying phonetic symbolism have demonstrated how the sounds of individual letters can contain meaning that may be useful in developing a new brand name (see <ref type="bibr">Klink 2000, Yorkston and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Menon 2004</ref> for reviews). Other research has examined global and cross-cultural implications of brand names (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schmitt 2001, Tavassoli and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Han 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Although companies frequently spend considerable sums on the design of logos, little academic research has explored the impact on consumer behavior of logo design or other visual aspects of branding (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Schmitt and Simonson 1997</ref> for background discussion). As one exception, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Henderson and Cote (1998)</ref> conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis of 195 logos to determine the ability of different design characteristics to achieve different communication objectives (see also <ref type="bibr">Henderson et al. 2004, Janiszewski and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Meyvis 2001)</ref>.</p><p>A related area, packaging, has begun to receive greater attention in recent years (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Garber et al. 2000, Folkes and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Matta 2004)</ref>. For example, Wansink has conducted several studies related to packaging size and shape and consumption (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Wansink and van Ittersum 2003</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Raghubir and Krishna 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Research Questions 1. What are the brand-building contributions of brand logos and other nonverbal brand elements? Are names and logos differentially effective or important in different circumstances, e.g., for high versus low involvement purchases or early versus late in the life cycle?</p><p>2. How are visual and verbal effects manifested in consumer memory for brand elements? Which are more accessible? Do more easily accessible elements influence or bias what is recalled subsequently?</p><p>3. From both a physiological and psychological perspective, how do brand and design elements gain attention and instill favorable attitudes? How long of a productive life do they have, i.e., when do they cease being effective? 4. How do consumers integrate packaging and other brand element information with information about product performance, marketing communications, or personal experience? 5. Are there criteria for combining a diverse set of brand elements? How do marketers know if their brand elements are "well integrated?" What are the financial consequences of integration?</p><p>Integrating Marketing Channels and Communications. Marketers employ an increasingly varied means of communication (e.g., various forms of broadcast, print, and interactive advertising; trade and consumer promotions; direct response; sponsorship; public relations; etc.) and multiple means of going to market (via retailers, company-owned stores or outlets, telephone, Internet, mail, etc.). Some marketers have attempted to orchestrate these activities to create synergistic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Duncan 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Research has shown that coordinating marketing activities can lead to beneficial results <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Naik and Raman 2003)</ref>. For example, print and radio reinforcement of TV ads-where the video and audio components of a TV ad serve as the basis for print and radio ads-has been shown to leverage existing communication effects from TV ad exposure and more strongly link them to the brand <ref type="bibr">Keller 1989, 1999)</ref>. Cueing a TV ad with an explicitly linked radio or print ad can create similar or even enhanced processing outcomes of the radio or print ad that can substitute for additional TV ad exposures.</p><p>Research Questions 1. Under what circumstances is marketing integration more appropriately based on consistency (sharing common brand meaning) versus complementarity (presenting different brand meanings)?</p><p>2. How should brand-building activities change as different audiences are targeted (e.g., consumers, distributors, press, analysts, etc.)? To what extent can and should a firm tailor different messages to different segments? When does confusion overwhelm the benefits of more precise targeting?</p><p>3. What are cost-effective vehicles for building brands? How do public relations, product placement, and experiential marketing approaches compare to traditional advertising and promotion programs?</p><p>4. What is the relative impact of third-party communications (e.g., competitors, rating services, web communications, or the government) on brand equity? How can a firm utilize positive communications and counter negative ones?</p><p>5. How do customer contact points (personal and automated) influence brand equity?</p><p>6. When changing the information communicated about a brand over time, how important is it for the messages to follow a logical progression?</p><p>Combining Company-Controlled and External Events. Marketers are increasingly embracing alternative forms of brand-building activities. In particular, greater emphasis is being placed on "guerilla marketing," creating emotion-laden experiences, generating "buzz" among consumers, and creating online and real-world communities. To understand the underpinnings of these activities, researchers studying interpersonal communication and influence have uncovered some important insights. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Muniz and O'Guinn (2000)</ref> defined "brand communities" as a specialized, nongeographically bound community based on a structured set of social relationships among users of a brand. After studying the Apple Macintosh, Ford Bronco, and Saab brands, they note that, like other communities, a brand community is marked by (1) a shared consciousness, (2) rituals and traditions, and (3) a sense of moral responsibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Schouten and McAlexander (1995)</ref> defined a "subculture of consumption" as a distinctive subgroup of society that self-selects on a basis of a shared commitment to a particular product class, brand, or consumption activity. Studying the Harley-Davidson and Jeep brands, they explore various relationships that consumers could hold with the product/possession, brand, firm, and/or other customers and use these to develop a measure of loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(McAlexander et al. 2002)</ref>.</p><p>A number of other researchers have explored wordof-mouth effects and their effect on brand evaluations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Laczniak et al. 2001, Smith and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Vogt 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Moore et al. (2002)</ref> delineated how intergenerational influences affected intrafamily transfer of brand equity in some product categories. Despite this attention to interpersonal sources of influence and communication, however, research has not systematically contrasted company-controlled and externally-driven marketing activities.</p><p>Research Questions 1. How can brand communities and social networks best be modeled, cultivated, and influenced by marketers? What is the relative impact on consumers of verbal versus other types of communication (e.g., mere observation)?</p><p>2. What is the relative impact of company actions, agents and evaluators, and customer conversations (e.g., web sites) on brand equity? How are sequences of interactions combined in the customer's mind? Does being first or last have any real advantages?</p><p>3. How much do opinion leaders influence other consumers? To what extent is communication "vertical" (from expert to novice) versus "horizontal" (experts talking to each other)? Are there "anti-opinion leaders," i.e., people from whom others consciously try to behave differently? What is their impact? 4. For socially conspicuous products, a major association influencing brand equity is other customers of the product. What is the relative importance of these associations versus company-controlled communications?</p><p>5. Does the Internet reduce the effects of brand equity and its impact on consumer decision making?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing Brand Performance</head><p>To manage brands properly, marketers should have a clear understanding of the equity in their brandswhat makes them tick and what they are worth. Two interesting subareas of this topic are the measurement and valuation of brand equity at different levelscustomer, product market, and financial market-and the relationship of customer equity to brand equity.</p><p>Measuring Brand Equity. In recognition of the value of brands as intangible assets, increased emphasis has been placed on understanding how to build, measure, and manage brand equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kapferer 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Keller 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Keller , 2003</ref>. There are three principal and distinct perspectives that have been taken by academics to study brand equity.</p><p>1. Customer based. From the customer's point of view, brand equity is part of the attraction to-or repulsion from-a particular product from a particular company generated by the "nonobjective" part of the product offering, i.e., not by the product attributes per se. While initially a brand may be synonymous with the product it makes, over time through advertising, usage experience, and other activities and influences it can develop a series of attachments and associations that exist over and beyond the objective product. Importantly, brand equity can be built on attributes that have no inherent value <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Broniarczyk and Gershoff 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Brown and Carpenter 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Carpenter et al. 1994</ref>, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Meyvis and Janiszewski (2002)</ref> show irrelevant information can be counterproductive in consumer decision making.</p><p>2. Company based. From the company's point of view, a strong brand serves many purposes, including making advertising and promotion more effective, helping secure distribution, insulating a product from competition, and facilitating growth and expansion into other product categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Hoeffler and Keller 2003)</ref>. Brand equity from the company perspective is therefore the additional value (i.e., discounted cash flow) that accrues to a firm because of the presence of the brand name that would not accrue to an equivalent unbranded product. In economic terms, brand equity can be seen as the degree of "market inefficiency" that the firm is able to capture with its brands. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> 3. Financial based. From a financial market's point of view, brands are assets that, like plant and equipment, can and frequently are bought and sold. The financial worth of a brand is therefore the price it brings or could bring in the financial market. Presumably this price reflects expectations about the discounted value of future cash flows. In the absence of a market transaction, it can be estimated, albeit with great difficulty (Ambler and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Barwise 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Feldwick 1996</ref>, from the cost needed to establish a brand with equivalent strength or as a residual in the model of the value of a firm's assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Simon and Sullivan 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Comprehensive models of brand equity have been developed in recent years to incorporate multiple perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ambler 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Epstein and Westbrook 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Keller and Lehmann 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">, Srivastava et al. 1998</ref>. Each of the three brand-equity measurement perspectives has produced relevant work.</p><p>Customer Level. The value of a brand-and thus its equity-is ultimately derived from the words and actions of consumers. Consumers decide with their purchases, based on whatever factors they deem important, which brands have more equity than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Villas-Boas 2004)</ref>. Although the details of different approaches to measuring brand equity differ, they tend to share a common core: All typically either implicitly or explicitly focus on brand-knowledge structures in the minds of consumers-individuals or organizations-as the source or foundation of brand equity.</p><p>To capture differences in brand-knowledge structures, a number of hierarchy of effects models have been put forth by consumer researchers through the years (e.g., AIDA, for Awareness-Interest-Desire-Action). Customer-level brand equity can largely be captured by five aspects that form a hierarchy or chain, which are bottom (lowest level) to top (highest level) as follows:</p><p>(a) awareness (ranging from recognition to recall); (b) associations (encompassing tangible and intangible product or service considerations);</p><p>(c) attitude (ranging from acceptability to attraction);</p><p>(d) attachment (ranging from loyalty to addiction); (e) activity (including purchase and consumption frequency and involvement with the marketing program, other customers through word of mouth, etc., or the company).</p><p>Many similar models exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aaker 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, Keller 2003</ref>. Several commercial versions are also available (e.g., Young and Rubicam's BrandAsset Valuator (BAV), WPP's Brand Z, and Research International's Equity Engine), although many focus largely on the first three aspects above.</p><p>There are several available research techniques to measure brands at each of these five levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Agrawal and Rao 1996)</ref>. In addition, research has provided insight into how the value of a brand's customer base relates to stock-market value <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Gupta et al. 2004</ref>). In the more qualitative realm, a variety of alternatives exist for understanding the structure of associations that a customer has for a product. These "mental maps" rely on concepts such as metaphors (i.e., "It is like a ____") to develop deeper texture in representing customer reactions to a brand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Zaltman 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Research Questions 1.

What is the relationship between qualitative and quantitative aspects?</p><p>Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 740-759, © 2006 INFORMS 3.

What unique measures are relevant in different categories, cultures, locations, or to different customer groups?</p><p>4. Well-known brands provide a role in reducing risk: Not only are brands signals of quality (both in terms of mean and variance), but they also provide the "deep pockets" needed to rectify a product failure. To what extent is increased confidence in decision making a key or even critical factor of brands and brand equity; i.e., are standard deviations more important than means?</p><p>Product-Market Level. A number of approaches have been developed to assess the impact of brand equity in the product market. These include measures of price premiums, increased advertising elasticity, decreased sensitivity to competitors' prices, and the ability to secure and maintain distribution through channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Hoeffler and Keller 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that leading brands can command large price differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Simon 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Agrawal 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">, Park and Srinivasan 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">, Sethuraman 1996</ref> and are more immune to price increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Sivakumar and Raj 1997)</ref>.

(2003)</ref> proposed that the revenue premium a brand commands vis-à-vis an unbranded product is a simple useful measure of brand equity and showed how it responds to brand actions. They contend that neither the sales premium nor the price premium alone captures the increased demand attributable to a brand.</p><p>Advertising may play a role in decreasing price sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Kanetkar et al. 1992)</ref>. Consumers who are highly loyal to a brand have been shown to increase purchases when advertising for the brand increased <ref type="bibr">(Raj 1982, Hsu and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Liu 2000)</ref>.

How much explanatory power does brand equity have after accounting for market-share effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(Uncles et al. 1995)</ref>?</p><p>Financial-Market Level. A different approach to measuring brand equity is based on financial market performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Amir and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lev 1996, Barth et al. 1998</ref>). One measure that has been proposed uses the component of market value unexplained by financial assets and results (i.e., profits). Using Tobin's Q (the market value of assets divided by their replacement value as estimated by book value) as a proxy of brand equity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Lindenberg and Ross (1981)</ref> found that consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Kellogg's, and General Foods had Tobin Q's greater than 2, suggesting that these companies had considerable intangible value. On the other hand, more commodity-like manufacturers such as metal producers and paper products companies had Tobin Q's of about 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Simon and Sullivan (1993)</ref> decomposed firm value into tangible and intangible components: Tangible components reflected replacement costs and included assets such as plant and equipment and net receivables; intangible components were broken down into industry-wide, cost, and brand factors. The brand factors were derived from a market share equation using an instrumental variables approach (i.e., brand value was determined by order of entry and advertising). As a percent of replacement values, brand equity ranged from a low of essentially zero for categories such as paper and allied products; petroleum and coal; stone, glass, and coal; and primary and fabricated metals to as much as 61% for apparel, 58% for printing and publishing, and 46% for tobacco. Firms for which brand value exceeded replacement cost included Dreyer's Ice Cream, Tootsie Roll, and Smucker.</p><p>Another approach to assessing the financial value of a brand involves taking customer mindset measures and relating them to stock-market values. This approach is used by Stern Stewart's Brand Economics which link Young &amp; Rubicam's BrandAsset Valuator, a survey-based measure of brand strength, to economic value added (EVA), a financial performance measure. Along those lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aaker and Jacobson (1994)</ref> relate yearly stock returns for 34 companies during 1989 to 1992 to unanticipated changes in ROI, brand equity, and brand salience. Using EquiTrend's perceived quality rating as a proxy for brand equity, they find that changes in quality and thus equity had a significant effect over and above that of changes in ROI. Firms who experienced the largest gains in brand equity saw their stock return average 30%; conversely, those firms with the largest losses in brand equity saw stock return average a negative 10%. Interestingly, other results suggest that there is a bigger improvement when the changes in quality perceptions occur among heavy users, a result consistent with suggestions that retention (impacting current customers) may often be the best way to increase customer and, hence, firm value <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Thomas et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Using data for firms in the computer industry in the 1990s, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aaker and Jacobson (2001)</ref> found that changes in brand attitude were associated contemporaneously with stock return and led accounting financial performance. Awareness that did not translate into more positive attitudes, however, did little to the stock price. Adopting an event study methodology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Lane and Jacobson (1995)</ref> showed that the stock market response to brand extension announcements depended interactively and nonmonotonically on brand attitude and familiarity: The stock market responded most favorably to extensions of either high esteem, high-familiarity brands or those of low esteem, low-familiarity brands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mizik and Jacobson (2003)</ref> examined the relative importance of valueappropriation activities (i.e., extracting profits in the marketplace via advertising and promotion) versus value-creating activities (i.e., through R&amp;D) on the stock market.</p><p>In an event study of 58 firms that changed their names in the 1980s, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Horsky and Swyngedouw (1987)</ref> found that, for most of the firms, name changes were associated with improved performance. The greatest improvement tended to occur in firms that produced industrial goods and whose performance prior to the change was relatively poor. Not all changes, however, were successful. They interpreted the act of a name change as a signal that other measures to improve performance-e.g., changes in product offerings and organizational changes-will be seriously and successfully undertaken. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Mahajan et al. (1994)</ref> suggest how to assess the level of brand equity in the context of firm acquisitions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Kerin and Sethuraman (1998)</ref> also have examined the link between brand value and stock value. In the brand strategy arena, <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Rao et al. (2004)</ref> examined the question of whether a "branded house" strategy with a corporate brand as an umbrella was associated with higher stock-market returns than a multiplebrand "house of brands" strategy. In their data, a corporate branding strategy produced higher average return than a multibrand strategy, perhaps to compensate for the greater risk due to the nondiversification involved.</p><p>Research Questions 1.

Marketingmix modeling has increased in popularity with industry and academics <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Gatignon 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Hanssens et al. 1998</ref>. Considerable research has examined the effectiveness of different elements of the marketing mix. For example, numerous studies have examined the short-term and long-term effects of advertising and promotion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ailawadi et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Anderson and Simester 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Dekimpe and Hanssens 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">, Mela et al. 1997</ref>). This research often looks at different outcomes and indicators of marketing effectiveness. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Pauwels et al. (2002)</ref> found that price promotion has a strong effect on category purchase incidence for a storable product but a correspondingly larger impact on brand choice for perishable products.</p><p>Although these research streams have provided considerable insight, they have not typically addressed the full breadth of brand equity dimensions.

Customers would find some distinguishing characteristics (name, color, shape) to identify products or services that had served them well and use them to simplify (make more efficient) future choices. Moreover, as satisficers, customers are slow to update performance improvements (or decreases) in their current or other alternative choices. The result, at least in the short run, is market inefficiency in the physical attribute product space. In essence, market inefficiency (see Hjorth <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">-Anderson 1984</ref>) can be seen as the same as brand equity, raising several interesting questions.</p><p>Research Questions 1. Do brands create value, provide value, or reduce value for customers?</p><p>2. Are there categories of goods for which large brand equities are acceptable (e.g., luxury goods marketed to affluent customers), and others where they are not (e.g., pharmaceuticals)?</p><p>3. Is market inefficiency and the creation of brand equity desirable or undesirable in terms of its effect on the overall economy? 4. How should marketers respond to criticisms of brands as being overpriced? As creating needs versus satisfying real needs? How about issues of product failure or safety? 5. What is the role of brands in acquiring and retaining employees? Do brands positively impact employee effort and hence customer satisfaction or welfare?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Choice Modeling</head><p>The previous discussion captures some of the research progress and gaps in the study of branding. The discussion also has some specific implications for incorporating branding concepts into choice models.</p><p>To demonstrate how brands influence consumer choice through their value (utility), we contrast the stylized "classic" microeconomic view of utility and choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Lancaster 1966</ref>) with a view which explicitly and/or implicitly encompasses the impact of brands. In the classic view, the value of brand j is the sum of its I (objective) attributes, net of price, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">VB j = i=1 I B i X ji − P j (1)</formula><p>Essentially, at the customer level, a brand is the lens through which the words and actions of a company, its competitors, and the environment in general are converted to thoughts, feelings, images, beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes, etc., about a product (or family of products). Much of the value of a branded product is in these subjectively determined components. The manner by which consumers transform objective product value to create additional (intangible) value leads to four components of brand value:</p><p>• Biased Perceptions X * ji − X ji , i.e., the extent to which specific product attribute perceptions are influenced by the halo effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Beckwith and Lehmann 1975)</ref>.</p><p>• Image Associations Z jk , i.e., nonproduct-related attribute beliefs such as "friendly" or "stylish."</p><p>• Incremental Value V j , an additive constant associated with the brand name that is not related to any particular attribute or benefit.</p><p>• Inertia Value S j , the value to consumers of simply choosing the same option rather than spending effort to consider others, e.g., due to switching costs, or the confidence (less uncertainty) of a known alternative. The value of a branded product (VBP) can be seen as the sum of the objective value of a product as well as the four components of brand value listed above:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">VB j = i=1 I i X ji − P j + i=1 I i X * ji − X ji + k=1 K C k Z jk + V j + S j (2)</formula><p>Note that S j is not strictly a brand term but rather reflects state dependence and can be modeled using the last brand purchased (otherwise, V j and S j are not identifiable). Much of the previous research that incorporates brands has focused on assessing the impact by modeling consumer choice with a specific brand term <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Srinivasan 1979</ref>). The rationale is a view that brand equity is what remains of consumer preferences and choices after accounting for physical product effects. Several approaches have been suggested:</p><p>• <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Kamakura and Russell (1993)</ref> proposed a scanner-based measure of brand equity that attempts to explain the choices observed by a panel of consumers as a function of the store environment (actual shelf prices, sales promotions, displays, etc.), the physical characteristics of available brands, and a residual term dubbed brand equity (here, V j .</p><p>• <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Swait et al. (1993)</ref> proposed a related approach for measuring brand equity which utilizes choice experiments that account for brand name, product attributes, brand image, and differences in consumer sociodemographic characteristics and brand usage. They define the equalization price as the price that equates the utility of a brand to the utilities that could be attributed to a brand in the category where no brand differentiation occurred.</p><p>• <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Park and Srinivasan (1994)</ref> proposed a methodology for measuring brand equity based on the multiattribute attitude model. The attribute-based component of brand equity is the difference between subjectively perceived attribute values and objectively measured attribute values, essentially the X * ji − X ji terms in (2) (i.e., the "halo effect," <ref type="bibr">Lehmann 1975, 1976)</ref>. The nonattribute-based component of brand equity is the difference between subjectively perceived attribute values and overall preference and reflects the consumer's configural representation of a brand that goes beyond the assessment of the utility of individual product attributes.</p><p>• <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Dillon et al. (2001)</ref> presented a model for decomposing ratings of a brand on an attribute into two components: (1) brand-specific associations (i.e., features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand), and (2) general brand impressions (i.e., overall impressions based on a more holistic view of a brand, here the Z jk s).</p><p>One clear and important implication of the above discussion is that the value of a brand is greater than either its additive (main effect) incremental value (e.g., in a conjoint study or logit model) or its impact on perceptions, and it needs to be separated from state dependence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influences on Brands</head><p>Brands are made, not born. The process of their construction is complex. From a manufacturer's point of view there is a reduced form, "stimulus-response"</p><p>Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 740-759, © 2006 INFORMS style simplicity to it: (1) the manufacturer takes actions (e.g., the marketing mix) and that leads to (2) customer mental responses towards the brand (perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and so on). These perceptions (and the resulting willingness to pay) in turn lead to (3) customer behavior in the product market (e.g., sales), which in turn generates (4) financial value in general and stock market and market capitalization in particular.</p><p>This framework or value chain is a useful basic conceptualization. Still, it obscures some important complexities. The first is that a brand's position is heavily influenced by others, e.g., competitors, governmental bodies, and interest groups, as well as by actions of employees and the identity and behavior of customers of the brand. Analogous to the customer level, high levels of brand equity reduce price sensitivity and make advertising more effective. Perhaps most important, it ensures distribution in channels with limited selection (e.g., convenience stores or small distributors), making it available in more locations. Greater availability may in turn impact (signal) perceptions: "If a brand is widely carried and displayed, then it must be good."</p><p>Thus, another complexity is that the impact of what the brand does depends on the brand itself (i.e., is endogenous), particularly in terms of its overall strength. Considerable evidence exists that strong brands have lower price elasticity with respect to their own price increases or price decreases of their competitors. Similarly, the advertising elasticity of strong brands may be larger. This leads to different decisions.</p><p>Consider the impact of advertising on one component of brand equity-image associations. Specifically, consider a simple model of how a specific image association k is related to a specific marketing program activity M n for brand j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Z jkt = Z jkt−1 + D jn * M jn (3)</formula><p>For a strong brand, the marginal impact of its advertising D jn may be greater than for a weak brand. Thus, strong brand j can spend less than a weak brand and still improve its image. More generally, the image of a brand depends on the N marketing activities of the various R competitors as well as main and interaction effects of its own activities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z jkt = Z jkt−1 + n=1 N D jn M jn + n=1 N p=n+1 N D jnp M jn M jp + r=1 R n=1 N D jrn M rn (4)</formula><p>The multiple consequences of brand equity mean that an aggregate product-market level model should at least include a brand main effect, brand interaction effects, and the impact of competition. This is obviously a very complex model so that simplifications are needed. For example, we can assume brand equity modifies the impact of marketing activities through a varying parameter formulation such as D jn = D n + wV j . It is also difficult, of course, to separate the impact of a brand from its unique attributes or attributes not included in the analysis. This separability problem makes it hard to identify whether apparent brand equity is due to brand image or attribute differences; attributing it all to the attributes may induce omitted variable bias whereas attributing it all to the brand may overstate brand impact.</p><p>Further levels of complication are also possible, although rarely considered. For example, the decision of channels to stock and support a brand depends on how much revenue it will generate which, in turn, depends in part on brand equity (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>. Similarly, brand equity can have indirect cost effects through its impact on volume (i.e., economies of scale) or by providing the confidence to suppliers for them to commit resources to "partnering" with a firm and supporting its product. It is also possible that brand equity influences competitive actions and reactions. For example, will a competitor be more or less likely to cut price when faced with a high equity competitor who is to some degree insulated from the impact of their price cuts? While we have no specific answers to these issues, these areas are promising and underdeveloped avenues for future modeling research.</p><p>Allowing mix elements to have different, competitor-specific effects, greatly complicates modeling by introducing more parameters than can be effectively estimated. One issue, therefore, is whether it is worthwhile trying to capture such complexity, i.e., by adding the large number of possible interaction (moderating) effects. Said differently, for some purposes, is a "wrong" but simple model likely to outperform an extensive but likely misspecified more complete/ complex model? Another related issue, particularly relevant for modelers, is how to capture such complexity in structural models of brand evaluation and competition. For purposes of this review, we leave these as an area for future analysis.</p><p>More generally, there may be a "virtuous circle." As brands develop positive brand equity, it becomes easier for them to develop further (and harder for competitors to compete with them). The obvious implication is that there are increasing returns to scale to building a brand, at least up to a point. The research question then becomes when, if ever, and under what conditions additional brand building becomes less efficient (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Naik et al. 2005)</ref>. Combined with the earlier discussion on the multiple ways a brand manifests its extra value, this suggests an important measurement issue: how to capture its total value and how to determine the relative contribution of its multiple sources.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the topics concerning brand-management decisions discussed above have direct implications for these modeling formulations. Developing brand positioning relates to how marketing activities (Ms) lead to the formation of attribute perceptions (Xs) and image associations (Zs) in Equation (2). Integrating brand marketing addresses, in part, consistency issues and is implicitly related to the interaction terms among marketing activities in general and making their impact positive in particular. Assessing brand performance relates to metrics which both measure the elements of Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and their consequences in the product and financial markets. Brands as growth platforms addresses the key strategic issues of how to orchestrate efforts over time to develop brands not just for </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Systems Model of Brand Antecedents and Consequences</head><p>A number of brand dashboards have been developed by firms which capture, but rarely link, many aspects of brand equity and performance. For branding research to be scientifically rigorous, it is important to develop a comprehensive model of how brand equity operates and to develop estimates of the various cause-and-effect links within it. To that end, we expand on the notion of a "brand value chain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Keller and Lehmann 2003)</ref>  antecedents to the brand value chain. Importantly, these activities can be characterized along two separate dimensions: quantitative factors such as the type and amount of marketing expenditures (e.g., dollars spent on media advertising), and qualitative factors such as the clarity, relevance, distinctiveness, and consistency of the marketing program, both over time and across marketing activities.</p><p>2. What customers think and feel. Customer mindset consists of the "Five As" discussed above. Importantly, there are feedback effects here, as demonstrated by the "halo effect" where brand attitudes affect perceptions of brand associations <ref type="bibr">Lehmann 1975, 1976)</ref>. Moreover, what customers think and feel about brands is obviously not under the sole, or often even primary, control of the company. Individual customer characteristics as well as competition and the rest of the environment help shape what is thought of the brand, e.g., by influencing expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Boulding et al. 1993)</ref>. Both personal experience (feedback from use and product satisfaction) and the experience of others (through word of mouth and "expert" ratings) also determine what a customer thinks of a brand.</p><p>3. What customers do. The primary payoff from customer thoughts and feelings is the purchases that they make. This product-market result is what generates revenue, share, and other metrics commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing programs. Of course, other things customers do, especially word of mouth, impact future product-market results and need to be considered in any comprehensive model. 4. How financial markets react. For a publicly held company, stock price and market capitalization, as well as related measures such as Tobin's Q, are critical metrics. In essence, these measures are the ultimate bottom line. As such, they are relevant at the CFO and CEO level, unlike most marketing metrics which are at the customer level or product-market level. Importantly, stock price is impacted by a number of other variables such as the growth potential of the industry as a whole, general economic trends, and stockmarket dynamics, which need to be controlled for in assessing the financial value of brands.</p><p>The overall model is thus conceptually fairly simple (i.e., it has only four main components), but in practice is both complicated (to account for all the influences and feedback effects) and stochastic.</p><p>The model reflects and accounts for a number of marketing principles. Consider the impact of a brand extension in the context of the Bass model of new product diffusion. Assuming there is some level of fit with a parent brand which has positive equity, a brand extension has advantages in terms of assumed product quality and the willingness of the firm to stand behind the product in the event of problems.</p><p>These expectations should increase the number of people willing to buy the brand extension initially (p, the coefficient of innovation) and the speed of diffusion of the extension through word of mouth (q, the coefficient of imitation) since it will seem less risky to those consumers who wait for others to buy it first. A stronger brand can more easily gain wider distribution which will also lead to faster trial among innovators (in effect, makes the market potential m larger). Thus, a reasonable prediction is that stronger brands will, ceteris paribus, have both faster diffusion and greater market potential.</p><p>To move branding toward becoming a rigorous science, a general model similar to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> needs to be tested and calibrated. Currently, little progress has been made toward estimating such a comprehensive model, or even a reduced form version of the model, such as marketing activities → productmarket results → financial impact. As noted above, there are certainly scattered empirical generalizations. For example, we know increasing ad budgets has little impact on current sales unless either the product or the use that is promoted is new <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Lodish et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Assmus et al. 1984</ref>. What is badly needed are:</p><p>(1) metaanalyses that combine partial tests of model components (i.e., only relating a subset of variables) into an overall estimate of the average links and key contingencies in the model, and (2) comprehensive studies that systematically examine the model, or at least a large part of it, in its entirety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Branding and brand management has clearly become an important management priority for all types of organizations. Academic research has covered a number of different topics and conducted a number of different studies that have collectively advanced our understanding of brands. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes some of the generalizations that have emerged from these research studies that were reviewed in this paper.</p><p>To put the academic literature in marketing in some perspective, it could be argued that there has been somewhat of a preoccupation with brand extensions and some of the processes that lead to the development of brand equity. By contrast, there has been relatively limited effort directed toward exploring the financial, legal, and social impacts of brands. In terms of methodology, considerable effort has been devoted to controlled experimentation (often with student subjects), although some work has focused on choice modeling of scanner data. Little integration of these two streams with each other or the qualitative work on branding has appeared.</p><p>Although much progress has been made, especially in the last decade or so, a number of important </p></div>

This review of these different areas suggests a number of specific research directions in those various research programs. Many important branding questions and issues are yet to be resolved. The above discussion will hopefully stimulate progress in these and other areas. Upon reflection, it may seem that some of these research questions are fairly uncontroversial. Further, there undoubtedly exists some research which bears, at least tangentially, on all of them. Nevertheless, they are worthy research questions because: (1) the issues have not been fully resolved at the level of "laws" or empirical generalizations, and (2) the issues are frequently raised by practitioners, suggesting that as a field our communications, if not our findings, have failed to reach and impact an important constituency.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Marketing</head><label></label><figDesc>Science 25(6), pp. 740-759, © 2006 INFORMS 4.
