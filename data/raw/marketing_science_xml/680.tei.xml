<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eric T. Bradlow</head><p>The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, ebradlow@wharton.upenn.edu I n the original version of the paper " 'Counting Your Customers' One by One: A Hierarchical Bayes Extension to the Pareto/NBD Model" by Makoto Abe (Marketing Science, Articles in Advance, June 23, 2008, DOI: 10.1287/mksc.1090.0502), an error in <ref type="bibr">Step [2b]</ref> of the data augmentation scheme exists and was detected by Siddharth S. Singh, Sharad Borle, and Dipak C. Jain.</p><p>In particular, when drawing y i , one needs to condition on z i , i , as well as i . In the scheme implemented by Abe ( <ref type="formula">2008</ref>), this conditioning of the y i draw on i is missing. Although the author does write in his Step [2b] "generate {y i z i , i , i }," i.e., y i is to be drawn conditional on z i , i , and i , however, as is clear from the explanation provided by the author ( ยง3.4 of this article), his drawing of y i was not done conditional on i . This will lead to an incorrect data augmentation procedure, which in turn will result in incorrect parameter estimates. Consequently, the original paper by Abe has been replaced by a new version (Marketing Science 28(3) 541-553) and addresses other important issues not addressed in the original Abe paper.</p></div>			</div>
