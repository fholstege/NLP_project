<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Blogs, Twitter feeds, social network profiles, user videos, and other forms of digital products have the common feature that the associated content's consumers are also its producers; hence such content is known as user-generated content. In the open source software (OSS) domain, where the user-generated content is a software product <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raymond 1999)</ref>, users are developers of software code as well as consumers of the resulting software products. Because the intellectual property or source code is available in the public domain, these products are referred to as open source products. The Android mobile operating system, Firefox browser, Apache Web server, and Linux operating system are a few examples of some successful open source products <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(O'Mahony and Ferraro 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The OSS paradigm provides an alternative to traditional, top-down, firm-driven software new product development (NPD) processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lakhani and von Hippel 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Shah 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, von Krogh and von Hippel 2006</ref>. In OSS development, NPD pro-cess success depends on the contributions of volunteer users who both produce and use the products (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">O'Hern et al. 2011)</ref>; various NPD projects thus compete for the community's attention and resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Subramaniam et al. 2009)</ref>. When project teams release working product versions quickly, they earn an early mover advantage that offers them the ability to appeal to the community earlier than their competitors and thereby benefit from the community's contributions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lakhani and</ref><ref type="bibr">von Hippel 2002, Raymond 1999)</ref>. Therefore, the time to product release is a critical metric for NPD process success in the OSS domain and the focus of our research.</p><p>The user community for an OSS project consists of two subcommunities: developer users, who include OSS project members and developers, and end users, who just download and use the product, though they might develop other projects. Drawing on the NPD literature in both traditional firm settings (for a metaanalysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Henard and Szymanski 2001)</ref> and the OSS domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Lee et al. 2009</ref>), Mallapragada, Grewal, and Lilien: Open Source Products: Founder's Social Capital and Time to Product Release Marketing Science 31(3), pp. <ref type="bibr">474-492, Â© 2012 INFORMS 475</ref> and recognizing the critical roles both subcommunities play, we propose three factors that influence OSS NPD process success: (1) the information and resources available to the project, which depend on the location of the project founders in the social network of developer users <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burt 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Lin 2001</ref>; (2) the interplay of the project's developer user and end user communities; and (3) the characteristics of OSS projects and the resulting products.</p><p>Project founders' social capital in the network of developer users is the basis for the first factor; we thus draw on literature from sociology pertaining to social networks and social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lin 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Obstfeld 2005</ref> and measure social capital through the embeddedness and brokerage activities of founders. Embeddedness measures the volume of information and resource input founders receive from the network; brokerage measures the novelty of such information and resources <ref type="bibr">Waguespack 2007, Nerkar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paruchuri 2005)</ref>. For the second factor, we measure both user engagement, which reflects how the end user community participates in the projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Stewart et al. 2006)</ref>, and the product's audience focus, which determines which community the products target, i.e., the developer users or end users <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Subramaniam et al. 2009)</ref>. For the third factor, we consider several OSS project and product characteristics, including the project founders' experience, type of open source license, and team size <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Stewart et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>). We model time to product release with a split hazard model to account for projects that never release a product. We collect data over 42 months and include 817 projects that began in January 2003 on SourceForge.net.</p><p>Results from a simulated maximum likelihood estimation of the split hazard model show that increases in both embeddedness and brokerage shorten the time to product release of new open source projects. In addition, the engagement of end users and product's audience focus significantly affect the influence of embeddedness on this time. Beyond their statistical significance, our results have managerial implications; for example, time to product release declines by an average of 31% when project founders have both high embeddedness and high brokerage.</p><p>In the next section, we discuss the OSS context, develop the central position that time to product release plays in that context, and introduce our conceptual framework. We next develop theoretical arguments for the main effects in our model. Then we outline our timing process model and describe our data source, data collection procedure, and measures. Next we discuss our findings and model validation approach, followed by the implications of our work for theory and practice, its limitations, and opportunities for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Background</head><p>The fundamental principle of the OSS model is simple: OSS community members who develop new digital products (developer users) post the source code on Internet forums (e.g., SourceForge, RForge) under an open source license, and other OSS community members test and use the product (end users), submit feedback, and may modify the code and create their own versions as long as they adhere to the open source licensing restrictions. The term "cocreation" describes such collaboration because content is created and used by the same set of members <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(O'Hern et al. 2011)</ref>. In this model, the users' decision to participate in a particular project often depends on the project's visibility, uniqueness, and popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lakhani and</ref><ref type="bibr">von Hippel 2002, Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>). Developer users contribute by writing and modifying code, resolving bugs, maintaining documentation, and addressing support requests; end users contribute by reporting bugs, downloading products, and participating in forums, which generate product visibility. Thus, the creation and maintenance of user-generated content involves the active and iterative interplay of the developer user and end user communities. <ref type="bibr">Raymond's (1999, p. 29)</ref> call to "release early, release often" is a central tenet of the OSS model. A product version that performs only core functions but lacks secondary features or final aesthetics can be released to generate rapid feedback and engagement from the user community. Releasing a product early may provide initial traction and attract dedicated users who offer vital early, critical feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lakhani and</ref><ref type="bibr">von Hippel 2002, Raymond 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, the first file release is a credible signal that the project team is serious about the project, which fosters interest and engagement from both the developer and user communities. Therefore, time to product release is a critical measure of success for OSS development. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Evidence from meta-analytic studies regarding the drivers of traditional NPD suggest that success depends on the product characteristics, organizational processes and strategies, and marketplace characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Henard and Szymanski 2001)</ref>. Similar OSS research suggests that OSS project and product characteristics, such as type of license, availability of prior code, user and developer interest (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Subramaniam et al. 2009)</ref>, and network locations of project managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006)</ref>, affect open source project Marketing Science 31(3), pp. 474-492, Â© 2012 INFORMS success too. Thus, the success of an OSS NPD process likely depends on the information and resources available and the characteristics of the product <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barczak et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Lee et al. 2009</ref>. Furthermore, because the OSS community consists of two distinct subcommunities-developer users and end userstheir interplay should also affect OSS NPD success.</p><p>In particular, the availability of information and resources for a project depends on the social capital of developer users working on the project, as reflected in their location in the social network of other developer users <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lin 2001)</ref> and their interactions with end users <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shah 2006</ref>). As in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the drivers of success thus should include (1) the founders' social capital, (2) the interplay of developer users and end users, and (3) control variables related to OSS project and product characteristics. Because developer users drive the NPD process, the effect of their social capital should be moderated by variables concerning the interplay of the developer user and end user subcommunities.</p><p>Literature on social capital and social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lin 2001)</ref> shows that sufficient embeddedness and brokerage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burt 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Granovetter 1985</ref>) provide the necessary resources for NPD projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Obstfeld 2005</ref>. When a new project begins, the founders' social network represents the primary connection to the OSS community and a critical determinant of information and resource availability. Research in organizational ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Romanelli 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Stinchcombe 1965</ref>) also shows that initial resource environments have lasting effects on subsequent organizational structures, processes, strategies, and survival likelihood. In the OSS context, the social network of the founders therefore should be the primary  source of information and resources at founding, and its characteristics should influence the success of OSS projects (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Waguespack 2007, Grewal et al. 2006</ref>). The interplay of developer user and end user communities can be characterized by two variables. First, the degree of user engagement captures the level of interest in the user community and indicates the level of information transfer between communities, forming a channel by which feedback from the end user community reaches the developer user community <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Stewart et al. 2006)</ref>. Second, the product's audience focus represents whether the developer user community presents products to the end user community as "developer-focused" (i.e., technical products) or "end user-focused" (i.e., nontechnical) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Subramaniam et al. 2009)</ref>. We theorize that the degree of user engagement and product's audience focus both moderate the influence of the developer user social network on time to product release.</p><p>Finally, following research on firm-centric NPD processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Henard and Szymanski 2001)</ref>, we incorporate the following project and product characteristics as control variables: the type of OSS license, the size of the first release file, the size of the project team, and the availability of prior project code (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Stewart et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Founders' Social Capital</head><p>Collaboration in goal-oriented groups occurs either through direct, natural collaboration between individual actors who interact <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coleman 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Granovetter 1985</ref> or through brokerage <ref type="bibr">(Burt 2005, Fleming and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Waguespack 2007)</ref>. In either case, collaboration signals trust and entails information and knowledge (resource) sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Uzzi 1997)</ref>. The resource benefits from direct collaboration are higher when the actor is more deeply embedded in the network; higher embeddedness implies greater access to "finegrained information" that tends to be "tacit, complex, or proprietary" <ref type="bibr">(Fleming et al. 2007, p. 444)</ref>. Resource benefits from brokered collaboration instead reflect the strength of weak ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Granovetter 1973)</ref>, which connect distant parts of a network, so actors that broker weak ties gain access to diverse information and control information sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burt 1997)</ref>.</p><p>To capture both forms of collaboration, we characterize founders' social capital as incorporating both embeddedness and brokerage (see <ref type="bibr">Grewal et al. 2006, Nerkar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paruchuri 2005)</ref>. For example, executing innovation requires the mobilization of available resources, which vary directly with embeddedness, but creativity often stems from integrating diverse information, obtained from social capital such as brokerage <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Obstfeld 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> we illustrate embeddedness and brokerage in a social network. Seven users work on common projects, and two users are connected if they work on a common project (i.e., a two-mode or affiliation network; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wasserman and Faust 1999</ref>). An actor's embeddedness increases as it connects to more actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Swaminathan and Moorman 2009</ref>) and becomes more central to the social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ronchetto et al. 1989)</ref>. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, user 4 works on two projects, and user 3 works on three, so user 3 is more embedded than user 4. Brokerage instead increases with actors' ability to connect disconnected parts of the network <ref type="bibr">(Burt 2005, Fleming and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Waguespack 2007)</ref>. User 4 brokers the relationship between two groups (left and right of user 4), (1) User 1 shares a project with users 2 and 3; user 2 shares a project with users 1 and 3; user 3 shares a project with users 1, 2, and 4; user 4 shares a projects with users 3 and 5; user 5 shares a project with users 4, 6, and 7; user 6 shares a project with users 5 and 7; and user 7 shares a project with users 5 and 6. (2) User 4 works on two projects, whereas user 3 works on three projects, so user 3 is more embedded than user 4 (degree centrality; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ronchetto et al. 1989</ref>). (3) User 4 brokers the relationship between the two groups, one comprising users 1, 2, and 3 and the other users 5, 6, and 7. As the sole link between these otherwise disconnected groups, user 4 scores higher on brokerage than the other users.</p><p>and as the sole link between them, it earns a high brokerage score by spanning gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burt 2004)</ref>.</p><p>2.1.1. Embeddedness. Embeddedness provides efficient access to other parts of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Ronchetto et al. 1989</ref>, so greater founders' embeddedness signals greater and often-required redundancy in connections. By serving as the access point for redundant connections, highly embedded founders enjoy the benefit of being the centers of action and can coordinate activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Swaminathan and Moorman 2009)</ref>. That is, high embeddedness provides the resources, information, and feedback necessary to ensure coordination in the OSS domain <ref type="bibr">(Fleming et al. 2007, Kogut and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zander 1992)</ref>, and it thereby reduces the time to product release <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barczak et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In our research context, newly founded projects compete in a crowded virtual community with strict resource constraints, with high rates of failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(von Krogh and von Hippel 2006)</ref>. Projects initiated by highly embedded founders gain access to diverse member skills, enjoy the benefits of improved coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Uzzi 1997)</ref>, and experience quicker product development. However, greater founder embeddedness means that they can devote less attention to any given project <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rosa et al. 1999)</ref>. Therefore, embeddedness should decrease time to market, with diminishing returns, and we hypothesize the following.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H 1 ). As the project founders' embeddedness at the time of founding increases across projects, the time to product release decreases at a decreasing rate.</p><p>2.1.2. Brokerage. Developer users that broker relationships by linking sparsely connected parts of a social network have access to and control over information, which gives the broker power and fosters creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burt 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burt , 2005</ref>. The combination of power and creativity should result in timely completion of high-quality NPD projects <ref type="bibr">(Fleming et al. 2007, Nerkar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paruchuri 2005)</ref>. The existing NPD literature supports this assertion for the general NPD process (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sethi et al. 2001, Song and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Parry 1997)</ref>.</p><p>For OSS, such improvements should result in shorter mean times to product release with diminishing returns to social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Zucker et al. 1995)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize the following.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H 2 ). As the project founders' brokerage at the time of founding increases across projects, the time to product release decreases at a decreasing rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Interaction of Embeddedness and Brokerage.</head><p>Several studies predict trade-offs in the extent to which social network members benefit from various types of social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burt 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Obstfeld 2005</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burt (2004)</ref> shows Marketing Science 31(3), pp. 474-492, Â© 2012 INFORMS that decreased brokerage might reflect greater connection density for a member, a larger network, or changes in the network hierarchy. Therefore, members in a network structure may have to shift their location to gain the benefits of one type of social capital relative to another. For our study context, this trade-off refers to the project founder's desire to achieve efficiency by improving embeddedness over the desire to foster creativity or increase brokerage by occupying a unique network location ). It parallels the exploration versus exploitation dichotomy that <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">March (1991)</ref> proposes for organizational learning processes.</p><p>Because founders' connections facilitate information and resource dissemination, greater embeddedness should directly benefit their new projects. When brokerage increases, founders also should obtain more indirect value from being able to combine disconnected sets of resources through greater embeddedness, which facilitates information dissemination ). Then projects benefit from founders' ability to create an environment marked by both explorative and exploitative processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Obstfeld 2005)</ref>. We predict that embeddedness has a greater impact on time to product release when brokerage increases.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H 3 ). As the project founders' brokerage at the time of founding increases across projects, the magnitude of the reduction in time to product release as a result of embeddedness increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Interplay of Developer Users and End Users</head><p>The exchange of information between developer user and end user communities is the primary basis for the creation and maintenance of user-generated content; we characterize this exchange using the degree of user engagement and the product's audience focus.</p><p>As user engagement (i.e., number of bugs reported) increases, the benefits that the project team receives from the community's feedback also increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006)</ref>. Products that garner many bug reports benefit from elevated user activity, which reveals problems in functionality and suggests fixes. Overall, the degree of user engagement should reduce time to product release. However, when the project founder's social capital is greater, the beneficial effects of degree of user engagement should be stronger: More social capital enables founders to understand and take advantage of user engagement and feedback to speed up the NPD process <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Hahn et al. 2008</ref>. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 (H 4 ). As the degree of user engagement increases across projects, the magnitude of the reduction in time to product release as a result of the founders' (a) embeddedness and (b) brokerage increases.</p><p>The product's audience focus is critical in the OSS context <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>). The project administrator decides whether to target developer users (technical) or end users (nontechnical), although it seems logical that development teams prioritize products with the broadest community appeal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lakhani and</ref><ref type="bibr">von Hippel 2002, Shah 2006</ref>). Therefore, user-focused, nontechnical products should exhibit a shorter time to product release than developer-focused, technical products. The effect of the founder's social capital also should vary by the product's audience focus. User-focused projects may generate less technical feedback, resulting in faster development <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lakhani and von Hippel 2002)</ref>. That is, the reduction in time to product release as a result of social capital should be greater for user-focused compared with developer-focused projects.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H 5 ). The magnitude of the reduction in time to product release across projects as a result of the founders' (a) embeddedness and (b) brokerage is greater for user-focused projects than for developer-focused products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model Development</head><p>To model the effect of the three theorized factors on the time to product release of user-generated products, we denote the founding point as time 0 and seek a model that accounts for (1) censored observations, (2) projects that never release a product, (3) the influence of covariates (some of which vary over time) and control variables, (4) unobserved heterogeneity, and (5) an appropriate specification of the underlying timing distribution. In our base model, the random variable T represents the time to the first product release when the hazard rate-or the probability of product release at time T , given that the first release has not occurred-is h T = f T /S T , with T as the time to product release, f â¢ as a probability density, and S â¢ as a survival function, where S â¢ = 1 â F â¢ and f â¢ = F â¢ , with F â¢ as a cumulative distribution function.</p></div>

Then C i indicates the release event for project i; so C i = 1 if a release occurs and 0 otherwise.

We gathered data on the network structure of OSS projects at their founding and the projects' characteristics from a sample of open source projects registered on SourceForge. Our access to these data proceeded through the SourceForge data warehouse, which records and organizes all activities on the site <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Madey 2005)</ref>. The data warehouse is a separate entity from the website and provides a repository of activities taking place on SourceForge, maintained by researchers at the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>To avoid inconsistencies or confounds from different start times and obtain the longest observation possible, we only selected new projects initiated during the first 10 days of January 2003, the earliest available data.

Subsequent monthly data dumps are available beginning November 2004 and are updated every month. These data about user-project memberships provided details about the founding users for 817 focal projects in the user-project membership table for January 2003.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Project Founders' Social Capital</head><p>Scholars use various embeddedness operationalizations, depending on the context, but the most widely employed measures include degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ronchetto et al. 1989)</ref>; we employ all three. Degree centrality is the number of existing projects connected to any given project founder in the network; in our study context, it captures the project founders' diverse contacts in the network. Betweenness centrality measures how well the network member can mediate flows of information; it is a count of all the shortest possible paths that include a founder and represents the ease with which the project founder can facilitate a transfer of resources over the network. To assess the efficiency of access to other locations by the shortest paths, we use closeness centrality. This measure is the sum of the shortest paths between the project founder and all other projects in the network. Greater closeness means the founder relies more on other members in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ronchetto et al. 1989)</ref>. Because closeness centrality is a summed measure, after being normalized, a higher value means the project founder is less embedded; we use the inverse of this summed measure.</p><p>To measure brokerage, we follow prior research <ref type="bibr">(Ahuja 2000, Fleming and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Waguespack 2007)</ref> and apply a version of what <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burt (1992)</ref> calls "constraint," or the degree to which a network member depends on directly connected neighbors to connect to others in the network. Therefore, brokerage measures the degree of opportunity available to the founder to form new connections in the network. Higher constraint implies lower brokerage, so we inverse code this measure by subtracting it from 1. When a project has multiple founders, we use an average to develop a composite measure. We provide the intuition underlying the measures in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and the technical details regarding their calculation in Appendix A of the electronic companion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Interplay of Developer Users and End Users</head><p>The number of bugs reported provides our measure of the degree of user engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006</ref>). This measure is highly correlated with the number of bugs resolved and thus captures the degree of product quality to a large extent, because resolved bugs signal the degree to which problems in the product have been addressed.

We constructed a dichotomous measure from information in the project details table in the data warehouse, such that 1 indicates a user-focused project and 0 a developer-focused project.   et al. 1999), which would benefit product development. Therefore, we measure founders' experience as the cumulative time since they registered in the open source community. When a project has multiple founders (34% of sample projects), we sum their experience. We also obtained data about whether the project development process relies on the community forum to communicate with users <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Madey 2005)</ref>. This control variable, forum usage, indicates the extent of use of the community feature provided by the website. Projects that use the forum may benefit more than projects that do not, so we control for this effect (1 if the project uses a forum and 0 if not). In the OSS context, different licenses grant different degrees of control over the source code <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Stewart et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>). The most common include the general public license (GPL) and the less restrictive limited general public license (LGPL). Because GPL is the most widely used, we code the type of OSS license as a dichotomous variable, where 1 indicates use of GPL and 0 otherwise. Finally, we include variables that measure the size of the released project files (file size at release) and number of project members (team size). Some projects lead to product releases immediately after registration because the development team has been working on the source code before registering. To control for prior code availability, we include a dichotomous variable that measures whether prior code was available at the time of registration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Subramaniam et al. 2009</ref>), which equals 1 if a prior code was available and 0 otherwise.</p></div>

Thus, we ruled out the exponential and the Weibull models, as these have constant and monotonic hazard functions, respectively. We then tested the log-logistic, log-normal, and the gamma specifications, all of which accommodate nonmonotonic hazards. Second, in the log-logistic model, a comparison of a probit (M4) versus a logit (M5) specification for the probability of eventual product release in the split-hazard specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schmidt and</ref><ref type="bibr">Witte 1989, Sinha and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Chandrashekaran 1992)</ref> shows that the logit specification fits the data better (M5: BIC M5 = 3 187 46, CAIC M5 = 3 942 46; M4: BIC M4 = 3 797 78, CAIC M4 = 3,861.78). We also find a statistically significant improvement in this logistic distribution specification for the hazard with logit link function specifications for the probability when we account for unobserved heterogeneity in the model (M6). The final model (M6) outperforms the best model from the second stage (M5) on various fit criteria (BIC M6 = 3 796 16, CAIC M6 = 3 861 16).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Interaction of Embeddedness and Brokerage.</head><p>In support of H 3 , regarding the synergy between embeddedness and brokerage in OSS product development, we find that the magnitude of the decrease in the time to product release with an increase in embeddedness increases as brokerage increases. However, this effect is only significant for embeddedness measured by degree centrality (b = â0 42, p &lt; 0 01) and closeness centrality (b = â0 68, p &lt; 0 01). The significance of the interaction between embeddedness and brokerage implies that projects whose founders are endowed with both high embeddedness and high brokerage see first releases quicker than projects founded by people who score high only on one of the social capital constructs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ai and Norton (2003)</ref> indicate that in nonlinear models, the parameter value of an interaction effect does not appropriately reflect the marginal interaction effect. Following <ref type="bibr">Greene (2010), 4</ref> in addition to the statistical significance of the interaction effects presented here, we also present a detailed analysis of the interactions in our model in the appendix.

Projects with a prior code at the time of registration on SourceForge release products at a faster rate than projects without this code (b = â0 69, p &lt; 0 01). Finally, the effects of the type of open source license, size of first release file, and size of project team are insignificant.</p><p>6.4. Robustness Checks and Model Validation 6.4.1. Sampling Frame. To rule out the possibility that our results are specific to our sampling frame, we created three random subsets from the 817 projects that constitute our sample. We then created three different samples by combining two random samples at a time: subsample 1 (n = 582), subsample 2 (n = 510), and subsample 3 (n = 542). We estimated three splithazard models with unobserved heterogeneity, one for each subsample. The results from all three models are consistent with those from the entire sample.</p></div>

With a correct prediction rate of 0.82, 6 our model specification outperforms the naÃ¯ve criteria of C pro = 0 51 and C max = 0 57 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Morrison 1969</ref>). 7 6.4.3. Alternative Dependent Measures. We conducted post hoc analyses of downloads and page views for projects in our sample. The time to first release, as expected, is negatively correlated with the cumulative number of downloads (â0 39) and page views (â0 19) before the first release date. The more the working version is downloaded or the more page views it garners, the shorter the time to release, which validates our premise that success measures such as downloads correlate with our dependent variable and in the right direction. We also ran two regression models, with downloads or page views as the dependent variable. We find that the explanatory variables that increase downloads also decrease time to product release. For example, project founder's degree centrality has a negative effect on time to product release (â0 10, p &lt; 0 10) but increases downloads (0.01, p &lt; 0 01) and page views (0.03, p &lt; 0 01). Similarly, brokerage decreases time to product release (â0 92, p &lt; 0 01), whereas it increases both downloads (0.66, p &lt; 0 05) and page views (0.04, p &lt; 0 05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>As the economic significance of user-generated content continues to grow, it becomes critical to understand how such content is created, managed, and used in various contexts. We study the factors that drive the success of new OSS projects, an important type of user-generated content. We conceptualize the interplay of two communities, developer users and end users, as the necessary basis for the creation and maintenance of user-generated content. Therefore, the time to product release of new OSS projects is influenced by the project founders' social capital, aspects of the interplay of developer user and end user communities, and the OSS project and product characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Theoretical Contributions</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, we summarize our study's findings with respect to extant research in innovation, social networks, and OSS product development. Several of our hypotheses are new, and our findings add to sparse research on specific factors that influence NPD success in an OSS context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grewal et al.

We extend this body of literature by studying the effect of all three factors simultaneously on time to product release.</p><p>Emerging literature in OSS also recognizes the importance of social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hahn et al. 2008)</ref>; we extend this research in two ways. First, rather than studying product outcomes such as commercial success <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006)</ref>, we consider the NPD process with time to first product release as an NPD process metric. Second, together with embeddedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grewal et al. 2006</ref>), we consider brokerage, which captures a founder's access to diverse information sets and thus creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burt 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Obstfeld 2005</ref>. Our results regarding the nonlinear main effect of brokerage and the interaction between embeddedness and brokerage (see Figure A.1) support the inclusion of both measures in a conceptualization of social capital in the OSS context.</p><p>Our work explicitly recognizes the role of two subcommunities in the network and their interplay, which is important for two reasons. First, it is central to the OSS NPD process and common in other user-generated contexts, such as pictures on Flickr and videos on YouTube. Second, it represents a contrast from the firm-centric NPD process; that is, although firms may seek user feedback during the NPD process, the level and intensity of such feedback is a managerial decision, not driven by users themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Managerial Implications</head><p>Our research has particular implications for managers of firms that participate in open source projects. Project founders' social capital plays a critical role, beyond the interplay of the developer user and end user communities or the impact of OSS project and product characteristics. If a firm engaged in the OSS community were to choose between, say, users 714 and 426 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; actual members of SourceForge) to collaborate on a project, it should consider their embeddedness scores: user 714 is likely to bring a project to market almost a full year (357 days) before user 426 would. Similar metrics might consider user and project data, as outlined in our model. For example, projects achieve a 51% decrease in their time to product release when the founder has high embeddedness (degree centrality in particular) and brokerage, but the decrease is only 12% when the founder â¢ <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grewal et al.

Recognizing the existence of two subcommunities helps managers find new ways to speed products to market too. They might offer more product versions targeted toward end users to encourage end user participation (e.g., beta testers) and increase bug reports. All else being equal, an increase of one standard deviation in bugs reported (42 bugs on average), or user engagement, reduces time to product release for the average project by 11%. Finally, the effects of OSS project and product characteristics have managerial relevance. Experience pays off, and our findings help quantify that payoff; a one-standard-deviation increase (54 days on average) in the cumulative experience of project founders reduces the time for the average project by 15%. Our results also can help managers justify the use of community collaboration tools: projects that use forums experience an 80% shorter time to product release than do projects that do not use forums.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Limitations and Research Opportunities</head><p>Our research centers on one user-generated content domain, whereas other contexts, including blogs and wikis, may not involve the same success metrics. By featuring only SourceForge, with its unique institutional idiosyncrasies, this study's propositions also require testing in other open source project domains. Our research is also limited by data availability and contains only structural network data;</p><p>Marketing Science 31(3), pp. 474-492, Â© 2012 INFORMS we observe the connections but not what they comprise (e.g., communication patterns, formal or informal hierarchies). Information about the type and quality of communication might enrich understanding of the process. Although time to product release is a critical NPD process metric in the OSS context, other metrics such as interrelease time may also be relevant.</p><p>It would be interesting to investigate whether and how our two subcommunity characterization applies to other user-generated contexts and how our findings about the role of social capital in innovation apply more broadly to the role of social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Stephen and Toubia 2010)</ref>. For example, bloggers typically link to other popular bloggers, and active Facebook users tend to have large social networks. Investigating the mechanics of network formation and growth in these contexts should enable managers of online social networking sites to develop new ways to manage and monetize traffic on their sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Conclusion</head><p>In the modern networked world, innovative models of communication and collaboration emerge rapidly, creating the need to investigate new phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Reibstein et al. 2009</ref>). The emergence of usergenerated content, for example, is changing how consumers share information, form communities, and connect, which has serious implications for marketing strategy. The OSS context represents one such important domain; as we show, the social network of developer users and the interplay between the developer user and end user communities have critical impacts on NPD process success. Social network analysis provides effective concepts and tools to address these new opportunities, and an emerging networked environment presents many important challenges for research. We hope our work has added insight and stimulates further research in this challenging and important domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electronic Companion</head><p>An electronic companion to this paper is available as part of the online version that can be found at http://mktsci.journal .informs.org/. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ai and Norton (2003)</ref> indicate that in nonlinear models, the parameter value of an interaction effect does not appropriately reflect the marginal interaction effect. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Greene (2010)</ref>, in addition to the statistical significance of the interaction effects presented earlier, we also present a detailed analysis of the interactions in our model in this appendix. To examine the interaction effects in detail, we first note that an interaction effect between two independent variables, say, v1 and v2, is the change in the partial effect of v1 on the dependent variable, say, z1 (i.e., the partial derivative of the z1 with respect to v1) for a unit change in v2. Following Greene (2010), we investigate these effects through two types of plots-in the first we depict the partial effect, and in the second we investigate the impact on the dependent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction of Embeddedness and Brokerage</head><p>In panel A.1 in Figure A.1, we show how the partial effect (plotted on y axis), varies with degree centrality (x axis, 1-9 represents the sample range) across two levels of brokerage (25th versus 75th percentile), keeping all the other variables constant at their means. The changing distance between the two curves in panel A.1 shows that the partial effect differs across two levels of brokerage, establishing the interaction effect. In the second plot, shown in panel A.2 in Figure <ref type="figure">A</ref>.1, we plot the effect of degree centrality (x axis) on the predicted value of time to product release (y axis, measured in log-hours) at two levels of brokerage, keeping all the other variables constant at their means. The plot in panel A.2 shows the impact of the interaction of degree centrality and brokerage on time to product release. From panel A.2, time to product release decreases by a maximum of 31% before increasing, as degree centrality changes from low to high under high brokerage, compared with an 11% decrease under low brokerage.</p><p>In panel B.1 in Figure A.1, we show how the partial effect varies with closeness centrality (x axis, 0.05-0.5 represents the sample range) across two levels of brokerage (25th versus 75th percentile), fixing all the other variables at their means. The changing distance between the two curves establishes the interaction effect. In panel B.2, we plot the effect of closeness centrality on the predicted value of time to product release for two levels of brokerage. From panel B.2, we see that time to product release decreases by 5.5% as closeness centrality increases under high brokerage compared with a 3.5% decrease under low brokerage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interaction of Founder's Social Capital and Degree of User Engagement</head><p>In panel A.1 in Figure A.2, we show how the partial effect of degree centrality (x axis, 1-9 represents the sample range) on time to product release varies across two levels of user engagement (25th versus 75th percentile), and in panel A.2, we plot the effect of degree centrality on time to product release across the two levels of user engagement. The changing distance between the curves in panel A.1 establishes the interaction effect, and from panel A.2, we see that time to product release decreases by 83% as degree centrality increases with a high degree of user engagement, compared with a 40% decrease for a low value.</p><p>In panel B.1 of Figure A.2, we depict how the partial effect of betweenness centrality varies across two levels of degree of user engagement, and in panel B.2 we plot the effect of betweenness centrality on time to product release across the two levels of degree of user engagement. From panel B.2, we see that time to product release decreases by 10% as closeness centrality increases from low to high for user-focused projects, compared with a 5% decrease for developer-focused projects. Notes. We used the 25th and the 75th percentile values in the sample for the low and high conditions of brokerage. For degree and closeness centrality, plotted on the x axis, we used their sample range. The partial effect, plotted on the y axis in panels A.1 and B.1, is the unit change in time to product release for a unit change in degree and closeness centrality, respectively. Time to product release, plotted in panels A.2 and B.2, is the predicted value of the dependent variable in log-hours from the estimation. Notes. We used the 25th and the 75th percentile values in the sample for the low and high conditions of degree of user engagement. For degree and betweenness centrality, plotted on the x axis, we used their sample range. The partial effect, plotted on the y axis in panels A.1 and B.1, is the unit change in time to product release for a unit change in degree and betweenness centrality, respectively. Time to product release, plotted in panels A.2 and B.2, is the predicted value of the dependent variable in log-hours from the estimation. Notes. Product's audience focus is measured by a dichotomous variable: user-focused versus developer-focused. For degree and closeness centrality, plotted on the x axis, we used their sample range. The partial effect, plotted on the y axis in panels A.1 and B.1, is the unit change in time to product release for a unit change in degree and closeness centrality, respectively. Time to product release, plotted in panels A.2 and B.2, is the predicted value of the dependent variable in log-hours from the estimation.</p><p>Interaction of Founder's Social Capital and Product's Audience Focus In panel A.1 in Figure A.3, we see how the partial effect of degree centrality on time to product release varies across the two types of audience focus, and in panel A.2, we plot the effect of degree centrality on the predicted value of time to product release for the two types. The changing distance between the curves in panel A.1 establishes the interaction effect, and panel A.2 depicts the impact of the interaction on the dependent variable. From panel A.2, we see that time to product release decreases by 98% as degree centrality increases from low to high for user-focused projects, compared with an 86% decrease for developer-focused projects.</p><p>In panel B.1 of Figure A.3, we see how the partial effect of closeness centrality on time to product release varies across the two types of audience focus, and in panel B.2, we plot the effect of closeness centrality on time to product release for the two types. The changing distance between the curves in panel B.1 establishes the interaction effect, and panel B.2 shows the impact of the interaction on the dependent variable.
