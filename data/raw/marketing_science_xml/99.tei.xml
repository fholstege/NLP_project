<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Advertisers are growing increasingly concerned about the ease with which traditional television advertising can be avoided. Product placement activities, where brands are visually and/or verbally incorporated into television and movies, have continued to grow. In contrast to television commercials that can be avoided by viewers, product placement is embedded in the programming itself and is more difficult to avoid. Despite its popularity, there is limited research in marketing that has investigated the impact of product placement. In this research, the authors investigate the relationship between product placement in television programs and the volume of social media activity and website traffic for the featured brand. Using data on nearly 3,000 product placements for 99 brands from the fall 2015 television season, the authors find that prominent product placement activities-especially verbal placements-are associated with increases in both online conversations and web traffic for the brand, with some evidence of decreasing returns at high levels of prominence. The authors also find that, for most placement modalities, television advertising occurring in close proximity to placement activities does not enhance these increases in online viewer engagement.</p><p>History: K.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Consumers' avoidance of advertising is on the rise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hinz et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Risselada et al. 2014</ref>. Just as marketers are facing increased difficulty reaching consumers with their messages online (e.g., eMarketer 2016, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vranica 2016)</ref>, advances in technology have reshaped the television viewing landscape. Viewers are increasingly engaging in multiscreen activity, with an estimated 85% of U.S. consumers media multitasking while watching television <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Nielsen 2015)</ref>. Whereas recent marketing research has shown that media multitasking can be leveraged to investigate responses to television advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liaukonyte et al. 2015)</ref>, there is some concern that this behavior can distract viewers from advertisements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fossen and Schweidel 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Technology has also facilitated the avoidance of traditional television advertising. The increased penetration and use of digital video recorders (DVRs) has provided viewers the ability to skip ads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nielsen (2016)</ref> estimates that 52% of U.S. households have a DVR, raising concerns about the reach and ultimate efficacy of traditional television advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wilbur 2008)</ref>. Television program consumption via streaming video on demand (SVOD) is also on the rise, with an estimated 54% of U.S. households having at least one SVOD subscription <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nielsen 2016)</ref>. The growth of SVOD has further heightened advertisers' concerns as these platforms carry reduced advertising loads and enable consumers to consume content while limiting the amount of advertising to which they are exposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schweidel and Moe 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Whereas consumers may limit their exposure to television advertisements, it is difficult to avoid product placement activities that brands undertake (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cowley and Barron 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Karniouchina et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Schweidel et al. 2014</ref>, as these placements are embedded in the program content. Product placement also offers brands the potential to promote their products in a more natural way <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell 2002</ref>) that is less expensive than traditional television advertising <ref type="bibr">(Katz 2013, p. 117)</ref>. This attractiveness paired with the shift in television viewers' consumption behaviors has contributed to the continued growth of product placement activities. In the United States, for example, spending on product placements grew 14% in 2017 to $8.78 billion and is estimated to top $10 billion in 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mandese 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its growth, limited empirical research has examined the impact of product placement efforts on television, which has exacerbated practitioners' challenges with measuring the effectiveness of placements <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Belch 2005, Gianatasio 2014</ref>). Media multitasking during television viewing provides an opportunity to observe viewers' reactions to programming via their online behaviors. However, whereas early research on such cross-media effects has investigated the impact of television advertising on online behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Joo et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Liaukonyte et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Fossen and Schweidel 2017</ref>, this stream of work has not yet considered the relationship between consumers' online activities and placements embedded in programming.</p><p>In this research, we examine the relationship between a brand's product placement activities on television and two measures of engagement that manifest as online behaviors: (1) the volume of online word-ofmouth (WOM) mentioning the brand and (2) the volume of traffic to the brand's website. In particular, we explore how the product placement modality may impact the relationship between product placement and viewers' online engagement with the brand. We also consider how product placement occurring in close temporal proximity to advertising may influence this relationship. In doing so, we investigate two primary research questions. How does product placement activity relate to changes in online WOM and web traffic for the featured brand? To what extent does product placement work independently or synergistically with traditional television advertising to associate with changes in these online behaviors?</p><p>Using data on 2,806 product placements for 99 brands that aired in the fall 2015 television season, the results from multiple analyses indicate that product placement can be associated with increased online engagement, with the strength of this relationship depending on placement modality. In particular, more prominent placements relate to larger increases in online chatter and web traffic for the featured brand, with some evidence of decreasing returns at high levels of prominence. Overall, our results support that product placement is a means by which marketers can reach consumers who have become adept at avoiding television advertising.</p><p>Additionally, our results suggest that advertising does not enhance the relationship between product placement and increases in viewers' online behaviors. Although we find evidence that the main effects of advertising and product placement can be related to increases in online WOM and traffic, their interaction effects are primarily negative or not significant. As proximity to advertising can enhance the prominence of placements, these findings may provide further support that placement effectiveness decreases at high levels of prominence, highlighting the importance of coordination between marketers, networks, and television content creators.</p><p>The remainder of this research proceeds as follows. We next review literature related to product placement and television advertising's impact on consumer behavior. We then describe the data, examine model-free evidence of the relationship between product placement and online brand WOM and web traffic, and discuss our empirical analyses. We present the results and conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Literature</head><p>We primarily draw on two streams of work. We first provide a review of the research on product placement. We then review work that has examined the impact of television advertising on online behaviors and discuss how product placement may influence online WOM and web traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Product Placement's Impact on Consumers</head><p>Prior work has examined the ways in which product placements affect consumers from multiple perspectives. O' <ref type="bibr">Guinn and Shrum (1997)</ref> demonstrated that what viewers see on television can affect their perceptions of reality. Those who reported higher amounts of television viewing tended to have higher estimates for the prevalence of behaviors that are featured on television, such as ownership of luxury cars and swimming pools. The authors suggest that exposure to products and behaviors on television may make them more accessible in memory, resulting in the belief that they are more common. This demonstrates television's ability to shape consumers' perceptions. Given this, the use of television as a means of influencing consumers' decisions should come as no surprise. Product placement stands in contrast to traditional advertising by being embedded into programming. Whereas advertising offers one approach of reaching consumers, it is readily apparent to viewers that they are being exposed to a persuasion attempt, which can trigger a defensive reaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Friestad and Wright 1994)</ref>. By contrast, product placement offers a more natural way for marketers to advertise their products <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Past research on product placement has shown that it can influence consumer behavior. In their review of audiences' responses to product placement, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balasubramanian et al. (2006)</ref> identify three types of effects: cognition (e.g., recognition, recall), affect (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fossen and Schweidel:</ref> Measuring the Impact of Product Placement brand attitudes), and conation (e.g., brand choice, purchase intention). Although research has often measured the effects of product placement on cognition and affect, there is limited work with conative outcomes. Moreover, existing research on the effectiveness of product placement has produced mixed results, with effectiveness varying based on the outcome selected and placement characteristics.</p><p>Although the findings have been mixed, research on product placement has illustrated that prominence is a key determinant of the placement's effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, van Reijmersdal et al. 2009</ref>). This prominence is often operationalized using placement modality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref>. Specifically, audiovisual placements are argued to be more prominent than verbal and visual placements because they spur both verbal and visual processing, resulting in information being better recognized and recalled (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Paivio 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, van Reijmersdal et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bressoud et al. 2010</ref>. Additionally, verbal placements have been argued to be more prominent than visual placements because they require higher plot integration (e.g., an actress saying a brand's name versus the brand appearing in the background) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Homer 2009</ref>) and because verbal information typically grabs attention better and encourages more elaboration than visual information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Posner et al. 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Homer 2009</ref>. This leads to verbal placements being processed more deeply than visual placements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Balasubramanian et al. 2006</ref>. Beyond modality, placement prominence may be further heightened by plot connection, location on screen, repetition, short-term proximity to television advertising, and placement duration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Balasubramanian et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Homer 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bressoud et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Karniouchina et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Verhellen et al. 2016</ref>.</p><p>Given that viewers must be exposed to a placement for it to impact their behavior, several studies have found that more prominent placements are more effective at influencing consumer behavior than less prominent placements. For example, audiovisual placements have been found to be better recalled and spur higher abnormal returns compared with verbal and visual placements (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Wiles and Danielova 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bressoud et al. 2010</ref>, and verbal placements have been found to be better recalled than visual placements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lord 1998, Russell 2002)</ref>. These positive effects of prominence are said to arise because prominence increases the probability that a viewer is exposed to a placement and makes it easier to process relative to other program stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Balasubramanian et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>However, placement prominence may backfire if its overtness makes obvious the persuasive intent or interferes with the plot. In such cases, high levels of placement prominence may invoke persuasion knowledge that can distract, irritate, or spur counterargumentation, leading to a more negative viewing experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Friestad and Wright 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Balasubramanian et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Homer 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Karniouchina et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Russell et al. 2017</ref>. Indeed, research has illustrated that placements can have negative impacts on brand attitudes if they are overtly prominent, such as when they are paired with a disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boerman et al. 2015)</ref>, out of place in the plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell 2002)</ref>, notably repeated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Homer 2009)</ref>, or paired with a preceding advertisement prime <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cowley and Barron 2008)</ref>. Other studies have shown that whereas more prominent audiovisual placements spur better cognitive outcomes, they do not necessarily improve affective outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Cowley and Barron 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, van Reijmersdal et al. 2009</ref> or conative outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Law and Braun 2000)</ref> beyond less prominent placements.</p><p>Additional investigations suggest that increasing prominence from low to moderate levels positively impacts placement effectiveness, but increasing prominence from moderate to high levels offers no additional benefit and may spur the negative effects of invoking persuasion knowledge noted above <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Homer 2009)</ref>. Such decreasing returns of placement prominence have been found to manifest as either negative effects of highly prominent placements on consumer behavior or statistically indistinguishable effects between different placement modalities that vary in prominence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Russell (2002)</ref> operationalizes prominence through plot connection and finds that although visual placements with high plot connection are better recalled than visual placements with lower plot connection, there is no significant difference between higher and lower plot verbal placements. This finding may occur because the increased prominence of plot connection does not offer additional benefits over the increased prominence of the verbal modality. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and Lord (1998)</ref> find that audiovisual placements offer no additional benefit over prominent visual placements. They contend that this may occur because the necessary prominence for recall has already been met by the prominent visual placement and that the incremental value of the audiovisual modality is undetectable.</p><p>Overall, the mixed findings on product placement across outcomes measured and placement characteristics are echoed from the practitioners' perspective (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Russell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Belch 2005, Gianatasio 2014</ref>). Our limited understanding of the efficacy of product placement is exasperated by the lack of research on the effects of placements on consumers' actions and <ref type="bibr">Fossen and Schweidel:</ref> Measuring the Impact of Product Placement <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 481-499, © 2019</ref> decisions. Two such studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wiles and Danielova (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Karniouchina et al. (2011)</ref>, both link placements in movies to stock market performance and find a positive relationship, although the latter work finds that more recent movie placements are less effective than placements that occurred when the advertising method was new to consumers. To the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have been done to broadly examine the effectiveness of television product placement on behavioral outcomes. In this investigation, we aim to address the dearth in research examining the impact of product placement on television on conative outcomes by assessing the extent to which product placement may relate to changes in online consumer behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Product Placement, Online WOM, and</head><p>Web Traffic A separate body of research has begun to investigate how television advertising impacts online behaviors. These voluntary consumer behaviors occur in close proximity to television media, allowing for identification of the media's impact on the behavior of interest through a quasi-experimental design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lewis and Reiley 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Liaukonyte et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Fossen and Schweidel 2017</ref>. Because of this proximity, these online behaviors may be better suited to studying ad effectiveness than sales or traditional survey measures, which take longer to observe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lewis and Reiley 2013)</ref>. Research also contends that the online activities generated by media multitasking viewers are good proxies for sales (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reiley 2013, Lewis and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nguyen 2015)</ref>. Overall, this body of work illustrates that television viewers' online behavior during programming can be leveraged to explore the effectiveness of television media.</p><p>Research on cross-media effects has shown that television advertising can have a positive impact on viewers' immediate online activity, including the volume of online WOM about the advertised brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fossen and Schweidel 2017)</ref>, volume of online search for the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Joo et al. 2014)</ref>, and volume of web traffic and purchases on the brand's website <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015)</ref>. Although this research presents evidence that television advertising can influence online behaviors, the relationship between product placement and online activities has not been considered. Given television's ability to shape consumers' perceptions (e.g., O'Guinn and Shrum 1997), we expect that product placement has the potential to influence online behavior. In this research, we leverage viewers' media multitasking to investigate the relationship between product placement and two measures of consumer engagement that manifest as online behaviors: the volume of online WOM mentioning the brand and the volume of traffic to the brand's website.</p><p>We focus on these two measures for three key reasons. First, both online chatter and browsing are voluntary consumer behaviors that viewers engage in immediately following television media viewing <ref type="bibr">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Schweidel 2017)</ref>, allowing us to link the timing of online behavior to specific placements. Second, as noted above, online WOM and web traffic are good proxies for sales. This is important in our data as the majority of placements are for brands for which measuring the link between television media and sales is challenging because of the low frequency of purchases (e.g., automobiles). Finally, these two outcomes capture different aspects of consumer engagement online, which is beneficial for a broad study of product placement activities on television. Decisions to post social media content are spurred by two main types of utility: intrinsic utility (e.g., inherent satisfaction from engaging in online conversations) and image-related utility (e.g., motivation to influence other's perception of oneself) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Toubia and Stephen 2013)</ref>. On the other hand, visiting a brand's website is primarily motivated by information search or purchasing goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Xu et al. 2017</ref>.</p><p>We anticipate that product placement will be associated with increases in both online WOM and web traffic for the featured brand. On the basis of prior research, we also expect placement prominence to influence this relationship. We anticipate that prominence will be particularly important in a media multitasking context where viewers are switching attention between multiple screens. In such a context, a verbal component to a product placement may be necessary for a viewer to process the placement. Verbal components also facilitate viewers' chat or search activities about the featured brand as they explicitly mention the brand name. Media multitasking may also dampen the perception that prominent placements are annoying, distracting, and/or a promotional ploy because viewers are too cognitively burdened to invoke persuasion knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yoon et al. 2011)</ref>. We treat the possible decreasing returns of prominence on placement effectiveness as an empirical question in our investigation.</p><p>We operationalize placement prominence using modality and the placements' proximity to advertising. For the former, we identify four categories of product placement in the data, varying from low to high prominence: implied visual placement, direct visual placement, verbal placement, and audiovisual placement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We also consider the placement's proximity to advertising from the same brand, as pairing advertising with product placement may increase the prominence of the placement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cowley and Barron 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Schweidel et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Russell et al. 2017</ref>. By accounting for advertising and exploring <ref type="bibr">Fossen and Schweidel:</ref> Measuring the Impact of Product Placement its interaction with placements, we also investigate the extent to which product placement operates independently or synergistically with television advertising to associate with changes in online chatter and web traffic for the brand.</p><p>Whereas previous research indicates that pairing a placement with advertising can increase the prominence of a placement, assessments of placement effectiveness are mixed. Some studies have found that pairing a placement with advertising can lead to better cognitive outcomes, such as recall and recognition, than the placement alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balasubramanian et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Wiles and Danielova 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Davtyan et al. 2016</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schweidel et al. (2014)</ref> find that a placement preceding an ad by the same brand can reduce channel-changing behavior, possibly because the placement had a positive effect on brand attitudes. However, other studies have found that increasing the prominence of a placement with advertising may have a negative impact on placement effectiveness. Priming a placement with a preceding ad by the same brand can eliminate the placement's positive impacts on brand attitudes, as this strategy can signal the persuasive intent to viewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cowley and Barron 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Russell et al. (2017)</ref> similarly find that whereas exposure to an ad before a placement can draw more attention to the placement, it also activates persuasion knowledge, which increases the perceived commercialization of the program and adversely affects the viewing experience. Overall, this research indicates that advertising may affect placement effectiveness. We treat the nature of this relationship as an empirical question.</p><p>Although we anticipate that the hypothesized relationships will hold for both online WOM and web traffic, there may be some variation in how product placement relates to changes in these outcomes as they are different consumer behaviors. As noted above, online chatter is more likely to be motivated by intrinsic or image-related utility goals, whereas visiting a brand's website is more likely to be motivated by information-seeking or consumption goals. Thus, placements for brands aligned with intrinsic or imagerelated utility (e.g., entertainment products) may spur more online WOM, and placements for brands aligned with information-seeking or consumption goals (e.g., newspapers, retailers) may spur more web traffic in the short term.</p><p>The activity a media multitasking viewer engages in may also depend on the device used, with smartphone/ tablet use more motivated by communication goals and laptop/PC use more motivated by information-seeking and purchasing goals (e.g., Google 2012). Using devices with smaller screen sizes is more physically challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ghose et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Xu et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Melumad et al. 2019</ref>, and it is possible that this increased cognitive challenge, in turn, may dampen the negative effects of placement prominence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yoon et al. 2011)</ref>. Thus, online behaviors that are more likely to occur on a smartphone, such as online chatter, may be less negatively impacted by placement prominence than activities that are more likely to occur on devices with larger screen sizes, such as web browsing. Overall, we anticipate that these differences will influence the relationship that product placement has with the outcome measures.</p></div>

The majority of the product placement activities in our data are for automobiles. The brands with the most placements are Ford (492), Chevrolet (383), Microsoft (263), Apple (234), and Fitbit (126). The majority of the product placement activities in the data are direct visual (66%), followed by implied visual (23%), verbal (8%), and audiovisual (3%). We see variation within brands in terms of the modality of placement activities and the number of programs in which the placements air (Online Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We also see variation in ad spending around the placements, both across and within placement modality types (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Although we find no strong correlations between the ad spending and placement measures (Online Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), we do see that ad spending on audiovisual post-placement is higher than its pre-placement spending levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This may suggest coordination among advertisers, television networks, and program creators for audiovisual placements, but we do not see similar evidence of coordination for the other three product placement types (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows descriptive statistics across placement characteristics.

Assessing the mean and distribution of change, we also see that more prominent placements might be associated with increases in these online activities more strongly than less prominent placements, as verbal and audiovisual placements are the modalities most strongly associated with increases in online chatter and web traffic. However, the estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> have sizable standard deviations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Brand-Level Analysis</head><p>Model Framework. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> present preliminary evidence that product placement has meaningful associations with increases in online WOM and web traffic. To further assess these associations, we conduct a preliminary brand-level analysis to investigate the relationship among online behaviors and placements and advertising, the use of which by the brand varies over time. For each brand b and 10-minute interval t on day d, we let Y btd1 = log(1 + WOM btd ) and Y btd2 = log(1+ Traffic btd ), where WOM btd is the number of Twitter mentions for brand b on day d in time interval t, and Traffic btd denotes the number of visits  Fossen and Schweidel: Measuring the Impact of Product Placement to brand b's website on day d in time interval t. We assume that Y btdj~N (µ btdj ,σ j 2 ) for j = 1 and 2 and that µ btdj is a function of brand b's product placement activity on day d in time interval t.</p><p>To allow for product placement activity from earlier in the evening to influence online activities later in the evening, we construct stock variables for each placement modality. We assume that, for each of the four modalities (denoted by z), PlacementStock btdz = δ z •PlacementStock b(t-1)dz + Placement btdz , where Placement btdz is the average size of the audience tuned to the program at the time that brand b is featured Notes. The horizontal dashed lines show the mean values of WOM, as measured by Twitter mentions or web visits, in the pre-placement and post-placement time windows, respectively. The y axis in the left column (the right column) shows the average per-minute tweets about the brand (average per-minute web visits to the brand's website). To extend our web traffic estimates beyond comScore's panel of 100,000 active U.S internet users to the U.S. population as a whole, we extrapolate our web traffic estimates to the U.S Census's estimated number of households in the United States with internet access in 2015 (91,256,576 households).</p><p>Fossen and Schweidel: Measuring the Impact of Product Placement</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 481-499, © 2019</ref> in placement modality z in interval t on day d (in 1,000,000s of viewers). The parameter δ z reflects the extent to which earlier placements of modality z carry over and impact later online behaviors. We similarly construct a stock measure of advertising by brand b, where AdStock btd = δ 5 •AdStock b(t-1)d + Ad btd in which Ad btd is the amount spent on television advertising by brand b on day d in time interval t (in $1,000,000s). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We also control for the amount of online activity in the prior 10-minute window as well as the time of day, day of the week, and month.

The coefficients β 1,1 -β 4,1 (β 1,2 -β 4,2 ) capture the main effect of product placement on online WOM (web traffic); β 6,1 -β 9,1 and β 6,2 -β 9,2 account for product placement's interaction with advertising. The coefficient τ 1 (τ 2 ) accounts for the effect of online WOM (web traffic) in the previous 10-minute interval on that in the current 10-minute interval. Finally, θ 1 and θ 2 capture the variation in online behavior related to the day and time blocks (daily half-hour intervals, baseline = Sunday 8:00-8:29 p.m.) and month (baseline = December). The coefficients are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation.</p><p>Model Comparison. We compare this brand-level model to one that omits product placement. For online WOM, the likelihood ratio test comparing the model that includes the main effects of product placement and its interaction with advertising (log likelihood (LL) = −142,054) against the model that omits product placement (LL = −142,072) indicates that the incorporation of product placement improves model fit (−2logΛ = 37.7, p &lt; 0.001). For web traffic, the model that includes product placement and its interaction with advertising (LL = −47,741) also yields better model fit than the model that omits product placement (LL = −47,754; −2logΛ=26.0, p = 0.001). This suggests that both online behaviors are better explained by the models that incorporate product placement.</p><p>Results. The results from the brand-level analysis are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>.

See the note under Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> about the calculation of percentage changes. The median value for pre-and post-placement advertising is $0, so below-median ad spend occurs when ad spend is $0.</p><p>Fossen and Schweidel: Measuring the Impact of Product Placement increased online WOM. These findings are consistent with work that shows that more prominent placement activities are more effective (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Wiles and Danielova 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bressoud et al. 2010</ref>. We see some possible evidence of decreasing returns of placement prominence as we find that verbal placements are associated with larger increases in online WOM than the more prominent audiovisual placements. With regard to web traffic, we similarly find that advertising and verbal and audiovisual product placements are associated with increases in web traffic for the advertised brand. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of placement prominence in moderating effectiveness. This analysis suggests that less prominent placements (implied visual and direct visual) do not meaningfully associate with changes in online chatter and web traffic for the placed brand, whereas more prominent placements (verbal and audiovisual) do relate to such increases.</p><p>We also see that the relationship between product placement and online behaviors can be moderated by advertising. Three of the four interactions in both the online WOM and web traffic models are either negative or not significant, suggesting that advertising occurring in close proximity with product placement usually does not enhance the relationship between the placements and online viewer engagement. The two exceptions to this conclusion are advertising occurring near audiovisual placements in terms of associating with increases in online WOM or near direct visual placements in terms of associating with increases in web traffic. As close proximity to advertising can enhance placement prominence, these results may suggest that placement effectiveness decreases when the salience of the brand is made too high.</p><p>Both the model-free evidence and our brand-level analysis suggest that product placement activities are associated with increases in online behavior, with placement modality influencing the strength of this relationship. These analyses, however, are not without their limitations. As they do not focus on a specific advertising or product placement instance, these analyses do not consider the program in which the brand-related exposure occurred. Additionally, whereas the analysis focuses on the modality of placement, further placement characteristics are not considered. To account for these factors and to better attribute changes in online behaviors to product placement activities, we next present our placementlevel analysis.</p></div>

This placementlevel investigation uses a quasi-experimental design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liaukonyte et al. 2015)</ref> to provide a more detailed analysis of the relationship between product placements and their characteristics and the outcomes of interest. For each incidence of product placement i,  <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 481-499, © 2019</ref> we model the volume of tweets that mention the featured brand and the volume of traffic to the featured brand's website post-placement as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">LogPostWOM i ρ 0 + π b[i],1 + φ p[i],1 + ρ 1 LogPreWOM i + 3 k 1 ρ 1+k AudienceSize i (Modality i k) + 2 k 1 ρ 4+k AdSpend ik + 3 k 1 2 j 1 ρ 6+3 ( j−1)+k AudienceSize i (Modality i k) AdSpend ij + X i λ + ε i,1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">LogPostTraffic i γ 0 + π b[i],2 + φ p[i],2 + γ 1 LogPreTraffic i + 3 k 1 γ 1+k AudienceSize i (Modality i k) + 2 k 1 γ 4+k AdSpend ik + 3 k 1 2 j 1 γ 6+3 ( j−1)+k AudienceSize i (Modality i k) AdSpend ij + X i k + ε i,2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where LogPostWOM i (LogPostTraffic i ) is the log of the volume of Twitter mentions corresponding to the brand in placement i (number of visits to website of the brand in placement i) that occurs between when the placement starts airing until 10 minutes after the placement. The variable LogPreWOM i (LogPreTraffic i ) is the log of the volume of Twitter mentions corresponding to the brand in placement i (number of visits to the website of the brand in placement i) that occurs 10 minutes prior to the placement airing until the placement starts airing. We use log specifications as there is large variance in these measures across brands. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The intercepts are ρ 0 and γ o . The brand-specific fixed effects are captured by π b(i),1 and π b(i),2 , where b(i) denotes the brand that appears in placement i. Similarly, the program-specific fixed effects are φ p(i),1 and φ p(i),2 , where p(i) denotes the program in which placement i appears. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The coefficients ρ 2-4 (γ 2-4 ) reflect the differences in LogPostWOM i (LogPostTraffic i ) attributable to variation in the modality of placement i. We let Modality = 1 indicate a direct visual placement, Modality = 2 indicate a verbal placement, and Modality = 3 indicate an audiovisual placement. We let a placement that is an implied visual serve as our baseline. Thus, ρ 2-4 and γ 2-4 reflect differences between an implied visual placement and placements of the other modalities. We weight placement modality by audience size so that our operationalization of product placement accounts for the number of viewers exposed to the placement. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The coefficients ρ 5 , ρ 6 , γ 5 , and γ 6 account for the impact of pre-and post-placement advertising from the brand in placement i that occur in the same program as placement i (AdSpend i1 and AdSpend i2 ). <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For both pre-and post-placement advertising, we consider advertising that occurs within 10 minutes of placement i. We further consider how advertising may interact with placements to relate to the outcomes. These interactions are captured by coefficients ρ 7 -ρ 12 and γ 7 -γ 12 . Finally, the vectors λ and κ account for the impact of placement characteristics and other control variables denoted by X i , which includes the time the placement airs (quarter-hour increments), length of the placement, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> program pod (i.e., program segment) in which the placement airs, cumulative placement activity in the program (both a linear and quadratic term), ad expenditures by the brand on different broadcast channels, and if the placement was interacted with by a character or was announced as a sponsor. We estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3) using maximum likelihood estimation with cluster-robust standard errors at the brand level.</p><p>Following the identification strategy used in research on the effects of television on online behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Schweidel 2017)</ref>, we use narrow time windows around the placement to better attribute any changes in online chatter and web traffic to the focal variables of interest, focusing on 10-minute windows in our analysis. 13 By controlling for online activity in the 10-minute window pre-placement, this analysis captures how placement activity relates to changes in the brand's online WOM and web traffic post-placement, above and beyond the brand's baselines of these online behaviors in the pre-placement period.</p><p>These granular time windows are beneficial because it is likely that most advertisers do not know the specific time at which a placement containing their brand will air, a point we argue for two key reasons. First, although our data do not indicate which placements are paid, coordinated placements (those that are more likely to be strategic decisions), we can probe their prevalence as such placement activities are likely to be integrated more prominently. Only 8% of the placement incidences are sponsors, a placement that is an in-program reference to an advertising sponsor, and only 3% of placements are integrated into the program with both a clear verbal and visual component. Second, even advertisers that pay for placements may not know the precise timing of when it will air (within or across episodes), as many coordinated placement agreements are season-long relationships. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Russell and Belch (2005)</ref> illustrate the complex nature of the product placement industry, bringing into question the volume of paid placement activity that is truly strategic. Given that it is likely that most placements in our data are unpaid and uncoordinated with the brand and that there are uncertainties with paid placements concerning their strategic nature and when they will air, it is within reason to assume that the majority of brands do not know the granular time window in which a placement will air.</p><p>Advertisers also do not know the precise time at which their television ads will air <ref type="bibr">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Schweidel 2017)</ref>. The ad buying process restricts advertisers' control over when and where their ads air <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Katz 2013)</ref>. The timing of when an ad will air is rarely stated in advertiser-network contracts, and even which program the ad will air on is not often stipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Liaukonyte et al. 2015)</ref>. Networks further restrict any jurisdiction over when an advertisement will air by ordering ads at random across commercial breaks and by using "make-good" policies that allow ads that did not reach the number of viewers paid for by the advertisers to be rerun on different programs on different days <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wilbur et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Given these characteristics of product placement and advertising, the airing of a product placement can serve as an appropriate shock to viewers' short-term online activity, which we use to explore how placement activities relate to changes in online behavior. Given that it is very challenging for advertisers to know granular time windows in which their product placement and advertising activities will air, it is unlikely that advertisers could push out additional promotional messages within a 10-minute window that could inflate the effect sizes in our model estimation. 15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results</head><p>Model Comparison. To explore whether product placement meaningfully relates to changes in online behavior to support the results from our brand-level analysis, we first compare our proposed model to several alternatives on model fit in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. The model fit comparison illustrates that placements meaningfully explain online WOM and web traffic. Specifically, the model with no advertising or placement variables explains 78.5% and 84.1% of the variation in online WOM and web traffic, respectively. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Incorporating the placement variables increases the explained variation of online WOM and web traffic to 86.4% and 92.0, respectively. Thus, we see that placement activity meaningfully explains online chatter and web traffic regarding the placed brand. Our final model also incorporates advertising and the placement-advertising interactions. We focus our placement-level results discussion on this model specification as it is our bestfitting model.</p><p>Product Placement and Placement Characteristics. We examine the relationship between product placement and viewers' online behaviors in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> We first focus on how placement modalities may differ in their relationship with online WOM and web traffic compared with implied visual placements, the least prominent modality. Consistent with our earlier findings that placements have a meaningful relationship with online engagement and that prominence plays a key role, we find strong evidence for verbal placements and weak evidence for audiovisual placements that these placement activities are more strongly associated with increases in online WOM than are implied visual placements. We also find weak evidence for direct visual placements and strong evidence for verbal placements that these placement activities are more strongly related to increases in web traffic than are implied visual placements.</p><p>Although these findings are highly consistent with our brand-level analysis, the results for audiovisual placements in the placement-level analysis were not expected. The findings that (1) audiovisual placements are only marginally associated with increases in online WOM relative to implied visual placements and (2) audiovisual placements do not significantly differ from implied visual placements in terms of their relationship with web traffic may occur for two reasons. First, these results could provide evidence for the decreasing returns of placement prominence on effectiveness. Our findings are consistent with past research that has found that (1) increasing prominence from low to moderate levels positively impacts placement effectiveness while increasing prominence to higher levels can spur negative effects, and (2) the decreasing returns of prominence can manifest as statistically indistinguishable effects between highly prominent versus less prominent modalities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gupta and Lord 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Russell 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Homer 2009</ref>. Our finding that online chatter appears to be less impacted by possible decreasing returns of placement prominence appears consistent with the notion that behaviors that tend to occur on a smartphone, such as online chatter, may be less negatively impacted by placement prominence than activities that tend to occur on larger devices, such as web browsing. Second, these results concerning audiovisual placements in the placement-level analysis are influenced by the improved set of placement characteristics in the placementlevel analysis. In particular, many of the placement characteristics with meaningful relationships with online viewer behavior (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>), which we discuss next, are commonly used with audiovisual placements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Overall, consistent with the brand-level analysis, the findings from the placement-level analysis underscore the importance of placement prominence in influencing effectiveness. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Across all of our analyses, we find the strongest evidence for verbal placements in terms of relating to increases in viewers' online behaviors.</p><p>Beyond modality, we find that placements that air later in the program are less strongly associated with increases in online WOM than those that air earlier in the program. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> This finding is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fossen and Schweidel (2017)</ref>, who find that online chatter about television ads marginally reduces during later ad breaks in the program. Reduced online brand WOM later in the program may occur because viewers increase their program-related chatter during this time as the show content becomes more interesting. Additionally, we find support that placements that are interacted with by a real person in a show (e.g., Blake Shelton on The Voice) are associated with larger increases in online WOM post-placement. This finding may relate to research on the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements and human brands (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Thomson 2006)</ref>.</p><p>We also find that referencing a placement as an advertising sponsor-compared with a placement that does not use this strategy-is associated with less  Notes. Cumulative placement is a placement stock measure, as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Online Appendix Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4, 5</ref>, and 6 show the estimates of the time, brand, and program fixed effects, respectively. *p ≤ 0.10; **p ≤ 0.05.</p><p>Fossen and Schweidel: Measuring the Impact of Product Placement web traffic post-placement. This finding may present additional evidence of the decreasing returns of placement prominence, as pairing a placement with a sponsorship disclosure can significantly increase prominence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boerman et al. 2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> also shows several nonsignificant effects of placement characteristics, which seem consistent with research that has found that placement characteristics related to plot integration and repetition have limited impact on affective or conative outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Law and Braun 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Wiles and Danielova 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Verhellen et al. 2016</ref>.</p><p>Product Placement and Advertising. We see some evidence that advertising by the same brand following a placement, particularly when it occurs in the same program, is associated with increased online WOM post-placement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>). For the interactions among advertising and placement activities, we find that half of the interactions in each model indicate a significant negative relationship. With the exception of the interaction effect of pre-placement advertising and the verbal modality on web traffic, the estimated interaction coefficients are smaller in magnitude than the advertising coefficients, indicating that the interactions tend to dampen the impact of advertising on online behavior. The other half of the advertisingplacement interactions suggest a nonsignificant relationship. As the proximity to advertising can enhance placement prominence, these effects may provide further support for the decreasing returns of placement prominence. These results are consistent with the brand-level analysis finding that advertising occurring in close temporal proximity with product placement usually does not enhance the relationship between the placement activities and online viewer engagement.</p><p>Scenario Analyses. To better illustrate the combined impact of product placement and advertising on online behavior, we conduct a scenario analysis for three brands (Ford, Microsoft, and Amazon) in which we vary the placement modality and the amount and timing of advertising. We use the average values for the brands' placements for the independent variables in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3) (e.g., average placement length). We calculate percentage changes in the two online behaviors relative to implied visual placements and show the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref>. We find that verbal and audiovisual placements are most associated with increases in online WOM, regardless of ad spending. Verbal and audiovisual placements are associated with as much as an 18% or 32% increase, respectively, in online WOM over implied visual placements. Additionally, verbal placements are most strongly related to increases in web traffic, regardless of the ad spending strategy, with as much as a 47% increase in traffic over implied visual placements. Although we see substantial differences in online behavior across placement modalities, online behavior is less sensitive to variation in ad spending, consistent with our finding that advertising occurring in close temporal proximity with product placement rarely enhances the relationship between the placement activities and online viewer engagement. 20</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Using data on product placement, television advertising, social media activity, and web traffic, we investigate how exposure to brands in television content may relate to changes in online behaviors. We find that prominent product placement activities-especially verbal placements-relate to immediate increases in online WOM and website traffic for the placed brand, with some evidence of decreasing returns at high levels of prominence. Whereas prior experimental studies have offered conflicting results, our research is among the first to provide evidence from the field that product placements can relate to detectable and quantifiable changes in consumers' online behaviors, suggesting that online WOM and traffic may provide marketers with a means of evaluating their product placements. Moreover, our research suggests that offline methods may serve as a means to reach consumers and encourage them to engage with brands online.</p><p>Our results also suggest television advertising occurring close to placements rarely enhances these increases in online engagement. Although we find that both the main effects of advertising and product placement can be associated with increases in online WOM and traffic, their interaction does not enhance (and oftentimes dampens) the positive relationship with online engagement. These results highlight the importance of coordination between marketers, networks, and content creators so that marketing investments are not squandered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Implications for Marketers, Television</head><p>Networks, and Television Content Creators For marketers considering product placement, our analyses suggest that placements can be used to reach consumers, even those who have become more adept at avoiding television advertising. Moreover, we demonstrate how consumers' online behaviors may be leveraged to assess placement effectiveness. The findings on the role of placement prominence suggest potential value for increased coordination between marketers, program creators, and television networks, as embedding a verbal or audiovisual placement in a program may require such coordination.</p><p>With consumers engaging in media multitasking, marketers should be particularly mindful of the impact of the verbal aspect of product placement.  <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 481-499, © 2019</ref> Whereas consumers' visual attention may shift from screen to screen, verbal (and audiovisual) placements offer a means of reaching them regardless of the screen on which their eyes are focused at a given moment. Verbal placements may require less coordination or be less costly than audiovisual placements. In deciding among different types of product placement, as well as coordinating these efforts with advertising, marketers must ultimately weigh the potential benefits against the financial costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</head><p>As technology assists consumers' desires to avoid marketing messages, the lines between marketing and content are becoming increasingly blurred. Our data do not indicate whether placements are paid or unpaid, precluding us from examining how the financial arrangement affects consumers' perceptions and their awareness of being exposed to marketing. Future research may incorporate such factors. Even though our data contain a mix of both paid and unpaid placements, we still find that placement activities relate to changes in online behavior. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Future work is also needed to assess consumers' exposure to marketing messages across devices and platforms, including mobile video consumption. Although our analysis focuses on changes in online WOM and web traffic in temporal proximity to placements, viewers are increasingly in control of when and how they consume content. Our data are limited in that it is not single-source nor does it allow us to directly observe an individual's behavior across devices and platforms. Such single-source, cross-device or crossplatform data would facilitate gaining a more complete picture of content consumption and exposure to marketing. As our analysis focuses on live viewing behavior and does not consider time-shifted viewing, our results may offer a conservative estimate of how placements relate to shifts in online WOM and web traffic. Whereas we focus on the volume of online WOM as an outcome measure, future research may delve into WOM content. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Future work may also delve into how the effectiveness of placements vary across brands. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Although we examine brands from multiple industries, such research may be best served by taking a narrower slice of brands or product categories. Another limitation of our approach is that our assessment of the change in online behaviors is restricted to differences observed in the short term. Thus, our analysis is not intended to assess long-term effects of product placement. Future work may consider the degree to which the effects of placements that we have documented persist and contribute to enduring shifts in brand perceptions. Such an investigation would also allow for the study of placement effectiveness throughout the customer journey, ultimately concluding with its impact on purchasing.</p><p>Finally, we use narrow time windows around product placements to study the relationship between placements and online behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Liaukonyte et al. 2015, Fossen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Schweidel 2017)</ref>. Although our robustness analyses help make the case that we have limited the influence of confounding factors that may occur around placements, such as brand-generated social media activity, it is challenging to account for all such factors. This is a common limitation of empirical research on the effectiveness of television media, as detailed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lewis and Reiley (2013)</ref>. However, if such confounding factors exist in our context while consistently occurring at similar levels around placement airings, the effect sizes of our results should be reasonable ones to expect for airing a product placement on television. Whereas large-scale randomized field experiments are not currently possible given the state of television technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reiley 2013, Lewis and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rao 2015)</ref>, such experiments or comparable laboratory experiments could be a fruitful avenue of future research to continue investigating the effectiveness of product placement activities on television.</p><p>In summary, we present the first empirical investigation to quantify the relationship between product placement activities and television using viewers' online behaviors. Through model-free evidence, a brand-level analysis, and a placement-level analysis, we present consistent evidence that prominent product placement activities-especially verbal placements-are associated with increases in online chatter and web traffic for the brand. We hope this investigation spurs marketers to take note of the potential to measure product placement's effectiveness using online viewer engagement and that it encourages additional explorations into factors that may enhance or mitigate the effectiveness of product placement.</p><p>10 Audience size is expressed in 1,000,000s of viewers. We test an alternative operationalization in which incidences are not weighted by audience size, which yields consistent results but does not improve model fit. We also estimate a model in which we include a control for the change in audience size from the start to the end of the placement. This model does not improve model fit compared with the proposed model, and the control is not significant. 11 Ad expenditures are expressed in $1,000,000s; 30% (26%) of the placements have pre-placement (post-postplacement) advertising that occurs within 10 minutes of the placement's airing. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> As the data include a number of lengthy placements, we run two alternative models where we estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) while (1) excluding the bottom and top 5% of placements based on length and (2) excluding the top 25% of placements based on length. Results from both these alternative models are statistically consistent with those of the proposed model, indicating that the outlier placements in terms of placement length are not driving the results. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We test 12 different time windows varying the pre-and postplacement lengths from 1 to 60 minutes. We also vary the time windows for ad spend so that they match the time windows associated with the dependent variables. Our key results are highly consistent in these alternative analyses (see the online appendix).</p><p>14 For example, an illustrative product placement agreement for MTV's Jersey Shore can be accessed via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website. Accessed November 7, 2018, https://www.sec .gov/Archives/edgar/data/1489256/000116169711000855/ex_10-1 .htm. The agreement specifies a period of "organic, on-camera product placement" from <ref type="bibr">September 10, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, through March 10, 2012</ref> This argument is strongest for narrow time windows, as longer time windows increase concerns about advertisers' ability to synchronize marketing efforts with the timing of placements. We considered alternative time windows ranging from 1 to 60 minutes and find results highly consistent with our main model (see the online appendix). As an additional robustness check, we exclude all tweets from the Twitter account(s) of the advertised brand as well as all tweets that contain "#ad," "#sponsored," or "#paid." Given the rare occurrence of such tweets in the 10-minute windows around placements, the results from this alternative analysis are nearly identical to the proposed model. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The explained variation is likely high because of the inclusion of LogPreWOM i and LogPreTraffic. 17 Online Appendix Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4, 5</ref>, and 6 show the estimates of the effects of time, brand, and program, respectively. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> We estimate a series of alternative models to see whether higherquality placements drive the main findings. We estimate models in which we exclude placements that are sponsors, audiovisual placements, longer placements, or placements that have post-placement ad spending within 10 minutes of the placement. Results from these analyses are statistically consistent with our proposed model, indicating that higher-quality placements do not drive our main findings (see the online appendix). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Interpretations of placement effectiveness as a factor of when the placement airs should also consider the effect of cumulative placements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>) and time (Online Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) (see Online Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr">20</ref> To assess whether the main results arise spuriously, we conduct a falsification test in which we only include those placement incidences that air to smaller audiences (the bottom 25th percentile in terms of audience size), as we would expect less of an effect of placement in such cases. We find no significant main effects of placement at the 95% confidence level in this analysis (see the online appendix). These results may provide support suggesting that our key findings do not arise spuriously but also may occur because the falsification test is underpowered. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> We estimate a series of alternative models to show that placements that are associated with increased coordination between program and advertiser do not drive our main findings. We estimate models in which we exclude placements that are sponsors, audiovisual placements, longer placements, or placements that have post-placement ad spending. Results from these analyses are statistically consistent with our proposed model (see the online appendix). <ref type="bibr">22</ref> For robustness, we consider the valence of online WOM. We find that the relationship between placements and online WOM is primarily related to increases in nonnegative WOM (see the online appendix). <ref type="bibr">23</ref> As an alternative analysis, we incorporated measures of visibility and excitement from the brand database collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lovett et al. (2014)</ref>, as they may relate to prominence and consumers' media multitasking activity about brands, respectively. These measures were only available for 51 brands in our data, and we did not find evidence that they moderated the relationship between placements and viewers' online behaviors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Model-Free Evidence of the Relationship Between Product Placement and Brand-Related Social Media Activity and Website Change in WOM pre-to post-placement (%) Change in web traffic pre-to post-placement (%) Mean (SD) Min First quartile Median Third quartile Max Mean (SD) Min First quartile Median Third quartile The volume numbers in the second and third columns are the summed volumes of WOM and web traffic in the 10-minute window post-placement.

Thus, these data focus on reactions to placements on Eastern/Central programming, which air to 76% of the U.S. population <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fossen and Schweidel 2017</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The second-level data from Crimson Hexagon are derived by accessing the list of Twitter posts, which includes the time of each post. The list includes up to 10,000 posts per day that match the query. If there are more than 10,000 posts matching the query on a given day, Crimson Hexagon takes a random sample of 10,000 posts from that day.</p><p>3 Our data do not code paid, coordinated placements versus unpaid placements, a limitation we acknowledge and discuss. Our data do allow us to probe their prevalence, as we later discuss, and suggest that their occurrence is rare. For robustness, we estimate a series of alternative models to show that placements that may be associated with increased coordination between the program and advertiser do not drive our main findings. Specifically, we estimate models in which we (1) exclude placements that are labeled as sponsors, (2) exclude audiovisual placements, (3) exclude longer placements, and (4) exclude placements that have post-placement ad spending. Results from these alternative analyses are statistically consistent with our proposed model (see the online appendix). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> There is high variation in the change in online WOM and web traffic across placement incidences. For example, the range between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for online WOM (web traffic) taken one minute after an audiovisual placement is <ref type="bibr">[0, 26] ([0, 4,563]</ref>). Given the high range, we do not present the percentiles in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The decrease in WOM following direct visual placements in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is consistent with the distribution of changes presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and may arise as a result of the variation across brands, an effect we control for in our analyses. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For robustness, we estimate our main placement-level analysis while excluding the top 1% or the top 5% of observations in terms of post-placement WOM and in terms of post-placement web traffic. Results from these alternative analyses are statistically consistent with our main analysis, indicating that the outliers in terms of postplacement WOM and web traffic are not driving the results. We also conduct an analysis in which we exclude audiovisual placements and also find results statistically consistent with our proposed model. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> We assume that the values of advertising and placement stock variables are reset to 0 each day, and we calculate these variables using data beginning at 7:00 p.m. (one hour before primetime starts). <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We take the log plus 1 to avoid taking the log of 0. We test a number of different specifications of the dependent variables including two specifications where the dependent variables are constructed as percentage changes measures and 12 alternative specifications where we vary the time window from 1 to 60 minutes. All of these alternative models produce highly consistent results (see the online appendix). 9 For identification, we set π 1,1 = 0, π 1,2 = 0 (for the brand Acura) and φ 1,1 = 0, φ 1,2 = 0 (for the program 2 Broke Girls).</p><p>Fossen and Schweidel: Measuring the Impact of Product Placement <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 481-499, © 2019</ref> </p></div>			</div>
