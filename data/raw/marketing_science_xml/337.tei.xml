Managers revere such brutal murderers as Alexander the Great <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Martino 2008)</ref>, Attila the Hun <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Roberts 1990)</ref>, and Genghis Khan <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Man 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cardone (2010)</ref> suggests that If You're Not First, You're Last, while both <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zichermann and Linder (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Newman (2013)</ref> advocate strategies to crush the competition. Despite research indicating that a focus on beating competitors (i.e., gaining market share) tends to reduce profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Collopy 1996, Armstrong and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Green 2007)</ref>, it is not difficult to find advocates for beating the competition instead of, or as a poorly theorized route toward, profit maximization.</p><p>In a market-based system, many suggest that profit maximization should be the manager's primary focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Friedman 1970)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alchian (1950)</ref> used an evolutionary logic to show that markets can induce profitmaximizing behavior, regardless of the participants' inability to maximize profit. Why then do markets not discipline those who focus on competitors rather than profits?</p><p>To address this question, we develop a series of evolutionary game theory models to study the marketlevel implications of a successive series of individual interactions. In markets that reward only profitability, we compare profit-maximizing managers with competitor-oriented managers, i.e., those who gain utility from defeating others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armstrong and Collopy 1996)</ref>. We show that in markets that select solely on the basis of profitability, a supposedly suboptimal strategy oriented toward beating competitors persists and thrives. Furthermore, our results imply that the notion of finding an optimal strategy can be illusory, as the best strategy at any point in time depends on the market's competitive composition.</p><p>Although a manager in any firm can hold a competitor orientation, we apply our evolutionary models in business markets as opposed to consumer markets. We study three types of competitive situations that cover a broad range of marketing interactions. Two of these, Chicken and Battle of the Sexes, have no dominant strategies, and one, Prisoner's Dilemma, has a single dominant strategy.</p><p>In the game of Chicken, two players compete for a prize that only one can win outright. The most straightforward example is market entry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Selten and Güth 1982)</ref>, where a single player entering gains a major payoff but more entrants cause disaster for all. Players can coordinate to achieve profitable outcomes  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sundali et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Rapoport et al. 1998</ref>) but empirical research shows that most new firms fail after a few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dunne et al. 1989)</ref>, suggesting an issue with over entry <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Camerer and Lovallo 1999)</ref>. Chicken games are widespread in business marketing situations. For example, in the competition for shelf space, powerful retailers may demand offers of investments from suppliers, such as slotting fees and trade deals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chu 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Lariviere and Padmanabhan 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Bloom et al. 2000</ref>.</p><p>In the Battle of the Sexes, both players value working together but disagree on how to share the benefits of such an approach. This set-up can result in many channel coordination problems, including double marginalization <ref type="bibr">(Moorthy 1987, Gerstner and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hess 1995)</ref> and the provision of quality service <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chu and Desai 1995)</ref>. For example, a retailer and manufacturer may each want to offer a low price to the end consumer, yet each also wants the other's margin cut.</p><p>Finally, in the Prisoners' Dilemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rao et al. 1995)</ref>, players are collectively better off if they do not compete but incentives drive vigorous competition; this situation commonly creates pricing challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rao et al. 2000)</ref> and promotion wars.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we discuss the related literature. We delve into the details of evolutionary game theory and compare it with more traditional game theory methods. We then develop the three models in detail, determine the nature of the possible equilibria, and discuss the routes to these solutions. We conclude with a discussion and implications for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Literature</head><p>Competitor Orientation A manager with a competitor orientation wants to beat others even at the expense of profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armstrong and Collopy 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Griffith and Rust 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Graf et al. 2012</ref>. If a firm aims to maximize profits, a focus on beating the competition is an error; it is not profitmaximizing behavior. For this reason, some researchers refer to such behavior as competitive irrationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnett and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hunt 2002, Brouthers et al. 2008)</ref>. We suggest, however, that, although a focus on beating others may often be unpleasant, it need not be erroneous when a manager personally values winning over profit. As such, we prefer the term nonstandard preference. Managers may maximize profits or willingly sacrifice them to defeat others, but to aim for both, as some managerial folklore advises, is incoherent.</p><p>Competitor orientation is widespread. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leeflang and Wittink (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brodie et al. (1996)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Keil et al. (2001)</ref> showed that managers tend to overreact to their competitor's actions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnett and Hunt (2002)</ref> link a competitor orientation to underdeveloped moral reasoning, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brouthers et al. (2008)</ref> suggest that it is increasing in transitional economies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kalra and Soberman (2008)</ref> even suggest that training and advice can spread the curse of competitiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolutionary Game Theory</head><p>Evolutionary game theory, a branch of theoretical biology, seeks to apply the precision of mathematical techniques to describe how strategies (broadly defined) work in a population. Early work in this area focused on competitive topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Maynard Smith 1982)</ref>, but the focus has recently moved toward the evolution of social preferences <ref type="bibr">(Dreber et al. 2008, Bowles and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gintis 2011)</ref> and even the advantages of nonstandard decision making, such as self-deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Trivers 2011)</ref>. Evolutionary game theory has become a mainstay of economic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Samuelson 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Gintis 2000</ref>. In marketing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Palmer (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ding (2007)</ref> use evolutionary ideas; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Homburg et al. (2013)</ref> use evolutionary game theory to examine strategy. Our research contributes by raising the profile of evolutionary thinking in marketing.</p><p>Evolutionary game theory examines long-run outcomes given numerous interacting players, making it ideal for studying markets, rather than the skirmishes at which traditional game theory excels. The evolutionary process is governed by the inclusion of a selection criterion that enables the transition of populations toward relatively successful strategies. Over many iterations, stable mixes of player types emerge.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides an outline of the steps in an evolutionary game theory process. Because the analysis is at the market level, we are concerned with the evolution of different groups in the population. In each period, players randomly meet and compete following the rules of a single-period, game-theoretic interaction. In our models, reputations are known and incorporated into competitive strategies. Selection is the key evolutionary game theory addition. After the payoffs from the interactions are calculated, the selection criterion (in our case, profitability) is applied, and the groups' sizes transition. The transition process we use, the replicator dynamic, is very general and could describe transitions driven by managers changing their orientations to mimic currently successful competitors. That said, we see transition as the churn in the market. The profitable are less likely to quit, and those with similar orientations to profitable managers secure start-up investment more easily.</p><p>Although evolution is a dynamic process, researchers use static equilibrium concepts to describe the direction toward which populations evolve. Equilibrium occurs when the market has no internal impetus to change; any orientation that exists in equilibrium will persist indefinitely. The key solution concept of evolutionary game theory, developed by Maynard <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Smith (1982)</ref>, is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), which is a subset of Nash equilibrium under which, when all play the ESS, Replicator dynamic used to reward profits alone</p></div>

When multiple equilibria exist, evolutionary research generally focuses on the mixed strategies as these are often the only evolutionarily stable strategies. Random (mixed) strategies can seem counterintuitive, but are often exhibited at the market level we are interested in.</p><p>A move may seem random to researchers, though no individual need randomize. For example, consider 10 managers, six aggressive and four who compromise.</p><p>Although the managers may have (unobserved) reasons for their decision, the researcher views the population as having adopted a mixed strategy of 60% aggression. Aggression is often successful when it intimidates the peaceful. However, when two aggressors meet, the ensuing fight can be disastrous for both. This frequencydependence of success is central to evolutionary game theory. Success depends on the behavior of others in the population. Business markets present marketers with similarly varied challenges. Thus, evolutionary logic suggests that effective strategies will vary substantially between markets.</p><p>Evolutionary models build on traditional game theory, but consider market outcomes rather than focusing on individual competitive skirmishes. The evolutionary approach requires weaker assumptions, as superhuman knowledge and infinite depth of reasoning are not assumed. Actors often need only understand their own preferences. Selection pressure weeds out unsuccessful strategies. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> clarifies the differences between the two approaches and highlights the advantages of the evolutionary approach to address questions about markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Games Without a Dominant Strategy</head><p>3.1. Modeling Conflict: The Game of Chicken In Chicken, there is no dominant strategy: A player's best choice depends on the other player's choice but the two players' incentives conflict. This ubiquitous game is analogous to numerous non-zero sum, conflictingmotive encounters (e.g., struggles between firms and nature's "red in tooth and claw" elements). It describes strutting young men in muscle cars and, not unconnectedly, political negotiators hoping the opposition will chicken out. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, arrows indicate that the row player favors aggression if the column player will compromise, but favors compromise when faced with aggression. Winning big involves aggression but can lead to a clash and mutual disaster. To be Chicken, the payoffs must rank Clash &lt; Lose &lt; Draw &lt; Win Prize.</p><p>The marketing applications are widespread:</p><p>• Rival business-to-business firms competing to induce retailers with offers they cannot refuse;</p><p>• Multinationals entering new markets that can support only one firm;</p><p>• Partners at advertising agencies displaying their best ideas to attract clients.  Needs no such assumption. We assume reputations are known but this knowledge is not required to apply evolutionary models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common knowledge</head><p>Often assumed, but models can vary information. Most evolutionary models use players with minimal knowledge.</p></div>

In our model, the market punishes the less profitable (i.e., reduces their representation in a market).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Details</head><p>Competing risk-neutral managers have one of two preferences (later we add reciprocators): Profit-Maximizing Managers: These managers, per economic theory, value only profit.</p><p>Competitor-Oriented Managers: These managers value profits and success relative to those they meet. They therefore value beating others independently of the profit it brings.</p><p>The state of the population at time t, q t , is defined as the proportion of managers with each preference. C t is the proportion of competitor-oriented managers, and 1 − C t is the proportion of profit-maximizers in the population at time t. (For mathematical convenience, the population size is assumed to be infinite.) In any period, managers are randomly paired for a single competitive interaction. Thus, the proportion of dyads where two competitor-oriented managers face off is C 2 t . Imagine two managers competing. Each has one of two generic choices: (1) Throw full force behind winning the big prize at any cost, which involves expensive preparatory work and aggressive terms. We refer to such active competition as aggression. (2) Alternatively, the manager can seek compromise, which will not win the big prize but will gain some business, providing the other manager also compromises. The choice is aggression or compromise. Managers behave aggressively if the expected utility from aggression is greater than the expected utility from compromise. Note, as detailed below, utility may differ from profit.</p><p>The manager chooses a strategy based on his or her preference (competitor orientation or profit maximization). This chosen strategy is the probability of being aggressive, given the manager's belief about the likely actions of the manager he or she faces. Managers may choose a pure or mixed strategy. The potential pure strategies are aggression 100% of the time or compromise 100% of the time. A mixed strategy is being aggressive randomly with probability .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Utility and Profits</head><p>When both managers compete aggressively, a costly struggle ensues resulting in a negative average payoff. The weighted average of aggression, fight, and win plus aggression, fight, and lose is − . If only one manager is aggressive, he or she wins the prize, gaining p (calculated as cost to serve). The payoff to compromise when the other manager is aggressive is equal to the outside option, normalized to 0. When neither manager is aggressive, both win some business, . We define i as the probability that a focal (row) manager is aggressive and −i as the probability that the other manager is aggressive. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows the profit matrix for the row manager.</p><p>The outcomes are rank ordered. Winning the big prize (i.e., the row manager is aggressive and the other The outside option (i.e., when only the other manager is aggressive) is worse than the payoff when both compromise. The expected utility to aggression if the other manager is aggressive, − , must be less than zero (otherwise aggression dominates, and this is not Chicken). The payoff ranking is: p &gt; &gt; 0 &gt; − . Profits depend on both managers' choices and are weighted by the chance of any outcome occurring. For example, the chance of both managers being aggressive equals the chance of the focal manager being aggressive, i , multiplied by the chance that the other manager is aggressive, −i .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Profit = − i −i +p i 1− −i + 1− i 1− −i (1)</formula><p>Profit maximizers care only about profits, but, for a competitor-oriented manager, utility differs from profits. The joy of the big win is not just about the profit but also about gaining more than a rival. Denote the additional utility from winning , where &gt; 0. Competitor-oriented managers hate losing and receive negative utility from having a lower profit than their rival. The outside option feels worse merely because the other manager won the big prize. Thus, the utility for compromise when the other manager is aggressive is −E where E &gt; 0. Whenever the managers receive the same profit, − and , utility comes only from profit, given no relative difference in ranking. The competitor-oriented manager's utility is shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. In Chicken, the rank ordering must be p + &gt; &gt; −E &gt; − ; thus, the pain of being beaten remains less than the pain of a clash.</p><p>The expected profit for a manager has two key determinants: (1) whether the manager predicts that his or her rival will be aggressive,ˆ −i ; and (2) the utility from any outcome.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Expected Profit = − iˆ −i + p i 1 −ˆ −i + 1 − i 1 −ˆ −i (2)</formula><p>The utility payoffs for the competitor-oriented manager, Equation (3), differ, as the competitor-oriented manager holds a different view of utility from a profit-maximizer.</p></div>

What Is the Probability of Being Aggressive? A manager's best response depends on the response of the other manager. An optimal probability of aggressiveness can be calculated depending on the manager's expected utility, which depends on the predicted likelihood of the rival's aggression. As a rival seems increasingly likely to be aggressive,ˆ −i → 1, aggression is less appealing. A point may exist where the rival's likelihood of aggression makes the manager indifferent (i.e., when the expected utilities of aggression and compromise are equal). For a profit-maximizing manager, Equation (2), indifference occurs when −</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ˆ −i + p 1 − −i = 1 −ˆ −i .</formula><p>Rearranging isolates the rival's entry probability:</p><p>Profit-maximizing managers are aggressive until</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">−i = M = p − p − + (4)</formula><p>Rearranging Equation (3) for competitor-oriented managers gives us:</p><p>Competitor-Oriented Managers are aggressive until</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">−i = C = p + − p + − + − E (5)</formula><p>If both managers share the same probability of aggression, equilibrium is possible.</p><p>Comparing Equation (4) with Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) shows that the mixed-strategy aggressiveness probability for the competitor-oriented manager is higher, C &gt; M , as and E are both positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reputation Matters</head><p>Because managers usually know who their competitors are, we consider a world where reputation matters. Each manager wants to convince his or her rival that he or she will be aggressive <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schelling 1980</ref>). However, credibly committing to aggressive behavior is difficult, given the pressure to chicken out. We therefore make the critical, but reasonable, assumption that it is  easier to convince rivals of something true (i.e., that a competitor-oriented manager will be more aggressive) than something untrue (i.e., that a profit-maximizer will be more aggressive). A manager's decision depends on whether he or she thinks the rival will be aggressive. If the rival is expected to adopt a lower probability of aggression than the manager's mixed strategy, M or C , the focal manager thinks the rival compromises too much, leading the focal manager to select the best response to compromise, i.e., aggression. If the rival is predicted to be too aggressive, the focal manager responds with compromise. Rivals who have the same preference both see their rival's aggressiveness as correct, thus generating the mixed-strategy equilibrium. Given C &gt; M , when facing competitor-orientation, the profit-maximizing manager always compromises. The competitor-oriented manager is aggressive at a strictly greater probability than the profit-maximizing manager will respond to with aggression. The reverse also holds: When facing a profit-maximizer, a competitor-oriented manager is always aggressive, seeing too much compromise. Profit-maximizers think competitor-oriented managers are too aggressive, but responding aggressively themselves is untenable. The competitor-oriented manager wins the prize without a challenge. Mixedstrategy solutions exist only when managers with the same preferences compete. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> details strategies when facing a specific rival. (For now consider only cells for profit-maximizers or the competitor-oriented. Reciprocators are discussed later.)</p><p>The profits using these aggressiveness probabilities and the profits from Equation (2) are shown in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>.</p><p>We next weigh the expected profit of a manager meeting a rival with a specific preference by the chance Table <ref type="table">8</ref> Profit Given Manager Preferences</p></div>

The rankings of the preferences are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref> (for details, see the appendix: Ranking of Preferences in Chicken). To understand the ranking in this table, read down the column, e.g., against a profit-maximizer being competitor-oriented is ranked first and being a profit-maximizer is ranked second. As the impact of a competitor orientation depends on whether the competitor-oriented manager's profits when competing against another competitororiented manager are greater or less than zero ( −C C &gt; 0 or &lt; 0), we examine these cases separately (ignoring the point −C C = 0). Weakly dominated preferences do not survive. A preference that never makes more, and sometimes less, profit against the preferences featured in equilibrium is driven from the population. If a preference is more profitable against any preference present in equilibrium, it survives.</p><p>First, note that a competitor orientation outperforms profit maximization when facing a profit-maximizer. Thus, if any profit-maximizing managers feature in equilibrium, a competitor orientation must also feature. The intuition is that a mutant whose preference is competitor-oriented will invade a market of all profit-maximizers. Note as C t → 0, competitor orientation becomes rarer in the populace, and those with competitor-oriented preferences perform better, restoring their numbers. Competitor orientation is never driven out of this population.</p><p>Proposition 1. In Chicken, competitor-oriented managers are never driven from the market by profit-maximizers.</p><p>Proof. Competitor-oriented managers outperform profit-maximizers when competing against profitmaximizers, i.e., −M C &gt; −M M , as p &gt; / p − + given p &gt; and p &gt; 0. The most intuitive outcome is where −C C &lt; 0. This occurs when a competitor orientation induces relatively more aggression. Thus, competitor-oriented managers hurt each other enough to allow the compromising profit-maximizers to maintain a presence in equilibrium.</p><p>Proposition 2A. In Chicken, where −C C &lt; 0, competitor-oriented and profit-maximizing managers each form part of the population in equilibrium.</p><p>Proof. Compared with profit-maximizers, the competitor-oriented perform better against profitmaximizers but worse against the competitor-oriented</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">, i.e., −M C &gt; −M M (see Proposition 1) and −C C &lt; −C M</formula><p>given −C M = 0. We can go further in the nonintuitive case when −C C &gt; 0. When a competitor-oriented manager performs better against another competitor-oriented manager than a profit-maximizer does against a competitor-oriented manager, then competitor orientation performs better against both preferences. Thus, the competitor-oriented managers are more profitable, and drive profit-maximizers from the population. Proposition 2B. In Chicken, where −C C &gt; 0, competitor-oriented managers overrun a population. M is 0. To illustrate in a numerical example, we assume that the cooperative payoff ( ) is 1 and the loss from a clash = 0 5. Furthermore, we assume that the pain from being beaten equals the joy from winning, = E = 0 5. We set the value of a big win (p) equal to 4 . Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the profit each preference gains given the state of the population. Note that profits fall for all as the level of competitor orientation (C t ) in the population rises. The competitor-oriented gain higher profits than profit-maximizers where the black line is higher. An equilibrium, all equally profitable, exists where the lines cross.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> plots the change in the equilibrium level of competitor orientation in the population as the payoff to winning (p) changes relative to the loss from a clash. Note that when p is close to , the rewards to aggression are limited, but as p increases relative to , the profit gained by those with a competitor orientation through intimidating the profit-maximizers, −M C , become so high that a smaller and smaller number of profit-maximizers persist in the population.</p></div>

All know the reciprocator's rule and respond with their own best response, i.e., the mixed strategy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> shows the entry probabilities; Table <ref type="table">8</ref>, the profits from pairings; and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>, the profit of each preference, given the state of the population.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">11</ref> shows the ranking of the preferences. Again read down the columns to understand the ranking. Note that profit-maximizers weakly dominate the reciprocators where −C C &lt; 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transition Process</head><p>To see how populations change, we must specify a transition process. We use <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Taylor and Jonker's (1978)</ref> replicator dynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fudenberg and Levine 1998)</ref> to model population transition. Each round, the population transitions through selection pressure toward preferences proving to be profitable in the market. When competitor-oriented managers are more profitable, their swashbuckling approach attracts investors, and vice versa. The transition formula we use is: j t j q t − j q t . At time t, j t is the proportion of managers adopting preference j in the population; j q t is the profit of preference j, given the state of the population; and j q t is the average profit across the entire population. Note that a preference's representation increases with greater relative profits; managerial utility/happiness is nice but does not affect the transition. Equilibrium exists when profits are equal across all preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Transition</head><p>Dynamo, a Mathematica program <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sandholm et al. 2012)</ref>, shows the impact of adding reciprocators. The vertices of the triangle represent a population of one preference; thus, the apex occurs where all managers are profit-maximizers. The arrows show movement using the replicator dynamic. For example, an arrow toward Reciprocator (bottom right) means that, starting at the base of the arrow, reciprocators are relatively profitable and are increasing in numbers. Warmer colors show faster change. The initial population does not affect the equilibrium reached if all preferences are represented. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we choose an arbitrary starting point. Reciprocators initially reduce competitor orientation (label 1), but as reciprocators perform relatively poorly against the competitor-oriented, the profit-maximizers displace the reciprocators (label 2). With no reciprocators to punish them, the competitororiented return to the equilibrium level (label 3). In summary, where −C C &lt; 0, reciprocators cannot exist in equilibrium with the competitor-and profitmaximizers since the profit-maximizing approach weakly dominates reciprocating.</p><p>Where −C C &gt; 0, reciprocators can take over, as they weakly dominate profit-maximizers when all three groups are present, and the competitor-oriented when only reciprocators and the competitor-oriented are present. Reciprocation succeeds only when those with a competitor orientation would overrun the market in the reciprocators' absence. The reciprocator's advantage emerges only after the (weakly dominated) profitmaximizers are removed from the population. The reciprocators can then leverage their greater ability to cooperate with their fellow reciprocators compared to the competitor-oriented.</p><p>In Chicken, a competitor orientation can persist in a market in equilibrium even when the selection pressure is based on profit maximization. Critically, profit-maximizing managers can never rid the market of the competitor-oriented managers.</p></div>

The analogy is to a married couple in the 1950s. The husband wants to have a manly evening, attending a boxing match or gambling; the wife prefers the opera, but neither wants to go alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gintis 2000)</ref>. For the husband, his wife compromising while he stands firm (i.e., is aggressive) is a big win. His compromise while his wife is aggressive is a small win, but better than the worst outcome of both going out alone. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref> shows the outcomes of the Battle of the Sexes, the requirement being that payoffs are arranged: Big Win &gt; Small Win &gt; Lose.</p><p>This basic structure applies to many situations in marketing channels; a surplus is gained by cooperation, but the players differ on who deserves the lion's share of the surplus.</p><p>• An equipment manufacturer and a system integrator want to offer a high-quality implemented system to the customer but both want the other to bear the majority of the costs.</p><p>• A manufacturer and a retailer try to set a price. Each wants to offer a low price to the consumer (i.e., to solve the problem of double marginalization), but each wants the other's margin to be cut.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Details</head><p>The Battle of the Sexes is a coordination game where the best results come from taking the same action.  (In contrast, Chicken is an anticoordination game, as the best results come from taking different actions.) As before, we create the profit and utility matrices (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">13</ref>), given that each manager knows the other's reputation. In the Battle of the Sexes, the off-diagonal payoffs can differ but that possibility is unnecessary; thus, we denote all coordination failures as 0. The focal manager wants the other manager to compromise but prefers to compromise rather than face a coordination failure. Thus profits are: p &gt; &gt; 0. The competitororiented manager gains extra utility from the other manager agreeing to his or her demands and is distressed when the other manager performs relatively better than him or her. Thus, the utility matrix for the competitor-oriented manager is shown in parentheses, where &gt; 0 and E &gt; 0.</p><p>We work out the entry probabilities forming the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for a manager of a given preference by setting utility as equal regardless of the manager's choice. Note that a competitor-oriented manager is more likely to be aggressive, C &gt; M , given &gt; 0 and E &gt; 0 and M = p/ p + and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C = p + / p + + − E .</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">14</ref> shows the probability of aggression and profit when managers of each preference meet. The rankings of profitability are shown in parentheses and should be read down the column. Note that, when facing profit-maximizers, the competitor-oriented make the most profit; when facing the competitor-oriented, the profit-maximizers make the most profit. Neither preference dominates, so both will exist in equilibrium.</p><p>We establish the expected profit, given the state of the population.</p><p>Profit Given State of the Population:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Profit Maximization M q t = 1−C t p p + +C t<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Profit Given State of the Population:</p><p>Competitor Orientation</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">C q t = 1−C t p + C t p + p + −E p + + −E 2 (9)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solution with Two Populations</head><p>Although in some circumstances, a single population model might apply (e.g., team-selling), the Battle of the Sexes intuitively uses two distinct populations (i.e., sexes), e.g., retailers and manufacturers. Indeed, how retailers perform relative to other retailers is probably a more interesting question than how a retailer compares with a manufacturer. The single population model provides a useful point of comparison: A single population has a mixed-population equilibrium. For example, with parameters p = 2, = 1, = 0 5, and E = 0 5, equilibrium exists when 69.5% of the managers are competitor-oriented. A similar result might be expected with two populations, and indeed a rest point exists where both populations have an equal proportion of competitor-oriented groups, e.g., 69.5%. However, this mixture is an unstable rest point; when both populations are at that point, there is no endogenous impetus for change; any random change, however small, will throw the populations out of balance, and they will not return to the unstable rest point. This failure to return to the unstable rest point occurs because, in two populations, movement to homogeneous populations is driven by the preferences of those faced. When facing a population with more than the equilibrium level of competitor orientation, the managers in the other population are more profitable when they are profitmaximizers. If one population for whatever reason (e.g., even by mistake) deviates from the equilibrium mix, the populations begin self-reinforcing movements toward homogeneity. A population facing slightly more competitor-oriented managers than equilibrium, will select for, and move toward, profit maximization. The more competitor-oriented population thus faces more profit-maximizers than in equilibrium, and the proportion of competitor-oriented managers similarly increases. These processes reinforce each other, leading to the competitor-oriented dominating one population and profit-maximizers the other. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> plots the level of competitor orientation in one population on the X-axis and in the other on the Y -axis. As before, arrows represent the direction of movement, and warmer colors represent faster movement. Open dots indicate unstable rest points; filled dots indicate stable rest points, i.e., equilibria that the market moves toward and returns to after a disruption. Note that the stable equilibrium points are 100% of one population and 0% of the other population competitor-oriented and vice versa.</p><p>Proposition 4. In a two-population Battle of the Sexes, if the population ever moves from the unstable population mix, competitor-oriented managers overrun one population and profit-maximizers the other.</p><p>Proof. Letq t be the unstable rest point where both populations are mixed between the competitor-oriented atĊ t and profit-maximizing managers. If the level of competitor-orientation in the population that is being faced is greater thanĊ t , then M q t &gt; C q t and C t decreases to 0. If the level of profit-maximization in the population that is being faced is greater thanĊ t , then M q t &lt; C q t and C t increases to 1.</p><p>We can also determine who makes more profit. Given that the populations in equilibrium are homogenous and adopt pure strategies, we can compare the profit from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">14</ref> with the profit of the reverse match-up. The competitor-oriented managers are always aggressive while the profit-maximizing always compromise, and, as p &gt; , the competitor-oriented earn more. Finally, we turn to another common marketing scenario, the Prisoners' Dilemma. Such dilemmas are most obviously seen in pricing, but also represent many advertising and promotional decisions. In stable markets where rivals compete for a relatively fixed number of consumers, all competitors are collectively better off when they cooperate, i.e., when they avoid cutting their price but each have an incentive to defect, e.g., to cut price. (Note that the customers may get a better deal through price-cutting; so, although the Prisoners' Dilemma hurts firms, the consequences are not necessarily universally negative.) The utility matrix for a profit-maximizing (competitor-oriented) manager is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">15</ref>, where s is the sucker's payoff. Given p &gt; 1 &gt; 0 &gt; s, all firms should always defect. In a sense, adding competitor orientation has little effect. The competitor-oriented manager merely enjoys defecting, when the other manager cooperates more, p + &gt; p, and suffers more when cooperating with defection, s − E &lt; s. All will still always defect, so the behaviors of the competitor-oriented and profitmaximizers are identical; they cannot be distinguished from each other through their actions, so selection cannot favor one preference over the other.</p><p>The Prisoners' Dilemma is an interesting game because it has a clear predicted outcome (i.e., all defect), leading to scholars attempting to explain why, in practice, defection is not universal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kreps et al. (1982)</ref> alter the assumption of common knowledge to some degree to assess how this alteration affects managers' decisions. Their game changes to a near Prisoners' Dilemma situation by enabling players to have uncertainty about the actions of others even where there is a finite end point. With this change, they show that a range of situations exist wherein a cooperative outcome occurs, often mirroring the results observed in experimental settings.</p><p>Building on the notion that changing the Prisoner's Dilemma slightly changes the insights, we investigate the boundaries of our results. We maintain all of our behavioral assumptions and basic market structure while changing the payoff structure. Defect remains the dominant solution for the competitor-oriented but a profit-maximizer may not see defect as the dominant solution. The two options we examine lead to diametrically opposed outcomes.</p><p>First, imagine that one manager cooperating while the other manager defects is less adverse in terms of profit, such that the parameter valuation changes to 1 &gt; s &gt; 0 &gt; s − E. Perhaps a segment of customers are willing to pay high prices to signal their high status. Thus, cooperating (i.e., pricing high) is more profitable than defecting (i.e., cutting prices) if the rival defects (cuts prices). A competitor-oriented manager cannot bear being undercut and thus cuts prices at the expense of profit so as not to be beaten. The competitor-oriented manager defects while the profit-maximizer responds with cooperation. When two profit-maximizers meet, each would prefer to cut prices but will not do so if the rival cuts. Two pure strategy solutions exist but, given no exogenous way to determine who will cut prices, we use the mixed-strategy solution process used above. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">16</ref> for all of the expected profit from all dyads.</p><p>Note that the rankings of expected profits (shown in parentheses in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">16</ref>), as before, should be read down the column. Compared with profit-maximizers, the competitor-oriented gains more profit against a profitmaximizer but less against a competitor-oriented rival. Thus, no preference dominates; both approaches will survive in equilibrium. This game resembles Chicken, and a competitor orientation persists despite selection that favors profits.</p><p>Second, we change the game so that the profitmaximizing manager does not want to defect if the other manager cooperates. We move away from the Prisoners' Dilemma by relaxing the stipulation that p &gt; 1 and instead examine a game where p + &gt; 1 &gt; p &gt; 0 &gt; s. Imagine a situation where customers have relatively high switching costs. Many customers will not switch to the firm with the lowest price, which makes cutting prices less profitable. The competitororiented manager will have a dominant solution of defect, as, in addition to profits, he or she values beating, and not being beaten by, the other manager. The profit-maximizer's approach is more complex. </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">−M M = p − S 1 − p + S (2) −C M = s (1)</formula><p>Competitor orientation (ranking) </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">−M C = p (1) −C C = 0 (2)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">−M M = 1 or 0 −C M = 0 (both equilibria) Competitor orientation −M C = 0 −C C = 0</formula><p>He or she will always defect against a competitororiented manager, given that the rival will always defect. Thus any dyad involving a competitor-oriented manager will lead to all competitors defecting. The profit-maximizing managers may, however, cooperate if they meet a fellow profit-maximizer, thus gaining (1), i.e., the expected profit matrix as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">17</ref>.</p><p>The challenge is that although a profit-maximizer may cooperate with another profit-maximizer, cooperation is not necessarily the outcome. Cooperation will occur only if the profit maximizer believes the other manager will also cooperate, which is not certain, as cooperation risks getting s, if the rival does not reciprocate. As Cooperate/Cooperate is intuitively preferable to Defect/Defect, this game resembles a Stag Hunt <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Samuelson 1997)</ref>. Mathematically, two equilibria exist but one is superior. Any solution depends on whether the profit-maximizers can develop a mutually beneficial coordinating mechanism. Assuming some possibility exists that they will cooperate, then profit-maximization will do no worse than a competitor-orientation and could do better. Without formally proving this outcome, we think it is reasonable to believe that cooperation will be achieved by profit-maximizers given that cooperation leads to the highest payoff for everyone. We, therefore, see this outcome as a boundary of our findings and conclude that the competitor-oriented firm will be driven from this market.</p><p>Of course, these modified games are not true Prisoners' Dilemmas but they illustrate important points: First, in competitive interaction, the precise game matters. Second, competitor orientation will not always persist. We instead conclude that in games that cover a wide range of marketing interactions, the market will not remove competitor orientation despite selection on profitability. Profit-maximizers may still, in certain circumstances, drive the competitor-oriented from markets.</p><p>Assuming any market is full of profit-maximizing managers is not necessarily false. We instead suggest this assumption is not necessarily true and should be examined given the game being played, the selection pressures in the game, and the managers playing the game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Given that competitor orientation exists in business <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong and Green 2007)</ref>, the implication is that the market fails to weed out those who violate the normative economic advice. The question is: Why? This research demonstrates a thought experiment. If sufficient time were allowed for equilibrium to emerge, could a competitor orientation persist in business markets that reward only profits? Our results are definitive: Selection on profitability will often not weed out the competitor-oriented.</p><p>Our analysis spans both games with a dominant strategy and those with no dominant strategy, and our three common games represent many business marketing situations. Chicken and the Battle of the Sexes, where managers must balance cooperation and conflict, often show a thriving competitor orientation. In the basic Prisoners' Dilemma, competitor orientation is not selected against; it is irrelevant. However, by varying the game to promote cooperation, more profitable, long-run outcomes can often be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Axelrod 1984)</ref>. It is in this spirit that we show that competitor orientation can be damaging because it discourages cooperation.</p><p>Our research should not be interpreted as suggesting that a competitor orientation will persist in all markets. The game being played affects the result. To this end, note that there are many games we did not study. Some, like patent races <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fudenberg et al. 1983)</ref>, make the distinction between profit maximization and competitor orientation seem less relevant; whereas others, like common value auctions, are left to future research.</p><p>Our research contributes to the literature by promoting the use of evolutionary game theory in marketing research. We break new ground by allying evolutionary modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Maynard Smith 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Gintis 2000</ref> with behavioral economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Camerer 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Camerer , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ho et al. 2006</ref>). Beyond our specific findings, we offer a method to examine which nonstandard behaviors might persist in marketplaces.</p><p>We establish a useful tool kit for investigating numerous marketing questions, especially those related to analyzing entire markets. Theories that apply to financial markets, where numerous anonymous players have little strategic interaction, may not apply to common marketing situations, where small numbers of players often conduct face-to-face negotiations.</p><p>More widely, our approach also has implications for behavioral research. One of the impediments to the wider acceptance of behavioral research is the belief that markets in equilibrium eliminate behavioral effects. For instance, despite numerous examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Odean 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Fehr and Gächter 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Camerer et al. 2004</ref>, many scholars remain unconvinced that behavioral considerations matter in markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fama 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Schwert 2003</ref>. Our results contribute in several ways. On one hand, our work shows that nonstandard behavior can persist. On the other hand, our work implies that documenting violations of normative advice is insufficient to demonstrate market failure. Together, these findings provide an opportunity to consider how violations of normative advice interact with market structures. We suggest that scholars can hope to develop precise descriptions of which nonstandard behaviors will survive, and in which markets.</p><p>Our research highlights the problem of providing decision-making advice independent of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gigerenzer 2008)</ref>. In one sense, all approaches in equilibrium are equally good but only in that specific situation. If an approach's success is frequency-dependent, i.e., depends on population, giving normative advice becomes impossible without the details of the population competing and the game being played. The implication, then, is that abandoning constructivist (i.e., deliberative) rationality in favor of ecological rationality <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Smith 2008</ref>) (i.e., actions fitted to the environment) should not be seen simply as arriving at the same destination but by a different route. Selection pressures may drive different outcomes from those recommended by traditional decision making. Homo economicus himself may not survive the selection pressure of business markets. Future research might consider how pro-social tendencies survive.</p><p>Note that despite demonstrating that a competitor orientation is supported in equilibrium, we do not advocate it. A competitor orientation can lead to serious problems because managers may become belligerent. Sometimes they are simply too brave. Fortune can favor the brave but can also kick the brave in the teeth. In our model, a competitor orientation is an unfortunate fact of life, not our recommendation.</p><p>In essence, searching for a perfect method of management remains a fundamentally flawed notion in a frequency-dependent marketplace. Understanding the marketplace and players is a vital first step in providing advice or developing marketing theory. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Profitability of Preferences Given State of Population</figDesc></figure>
