<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract. In 2012, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, representing the single largest source of revenue for banks from demand deposit accounts during this period. Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because of impulsive spending. However, we also find that high monitoring costs hinder consumers' effort to track their balance accurately; consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention. The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft waiver programs may also enhance social welfare. This paper explains consumer responses to overdraft fees and evaluates alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>An overdraft occurs when a consumer spends or withdraws an amount of funds from his or her checking account that exceeds the account's available funds. U.S. banks allow consumers to overdraw their account (subject to some restrictions at the bank's discretion) but charge an overdraft fee (OD). Overdraft fees have been a major source of bank revenue since the early 1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Topper 2012)</ref>, when banks started to offer free checking accounts to attract consumers. According to Moebs Services, the total amount of overdraft fees in the United States reached $32 billion in 2012. This is equivalent to an average of $178 for each checking account annually. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> According to the Center for Responsible Lending, U.S. households spent more on overdraft fees than on fresh vegetables, postage, or books in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burns 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Overdraft fees have provoked a storm of consumer dissatisfaction and can induce many consumers who experience these fees to close their accounts. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The U.S. government has taken actions to regulate overdraft fees through the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and it may take more drastic steps in the future. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Therefore, there are pressures throughout the industry for banks to reexamine their overdraft fee practices to prevent churn and better prepare for regulations.</p><p>A potential solution for both consumers and banks is to leverage financial transaction data to manage overdrafting and offer new services using these financial transaction data. Financial institutions store massive amounts of information about consumers, commonly referred to as big data, as a by-product of their transactions. In this research, we show how this information can be harnessed with structural economic theories to predict consumers' overdrafting behavior. The largescale of our financial transaction panel data allows us to detect rare events of overdrafts, identify rich consumer heterogeneity, and minimize sampling bias to avoid potential financial losses. Consequently, we propose strategies that can increase both consumer welfare and bank revenue. Our goal is to show that the knowledge about consumers contained within their financial transaction data can form the basis for improving customer welfare and increasing profitability for the bank by tapping into this underutilized resource for marketing purposes.</p><p>The ultimate objective of this paper is to investigate alternative pricing strategies of overdraft fees. Specifically, we tackle the following questions: Is the current overdraft fee structure optimal? How will bank revenue and consumer welfare change under alternative pricing strategies? The answers to these questions rely on our understanding of the decision process underlying consumers' overdrafting behavior. So, we first address the following research questions: Why do consumers overdraw? How do consumers react to overdraft fees?</p><p>To study these problems, we obtained anonymized data from a large U.S. bank. The data include over 500,000 accounts with a history of up to 450 days, amounting to 200 million relevant observations. This enterprise-level data set is much larger than those reported in other research studies. Substantively, we find that some consumers are inattentive in monitoring their balances because of the associated high monitoring costs. In contrast, attentive consumers primarily overdraw because they heavily discount future utilities (they are subject to impulsive spending) or use overdrafts to satisfy short-term liquidity constraint. Consumers who are dissatisfied may then leave their bank after being charged high overdraft fees.</p><p>These findings suggest that to evaluate the welfare consequences of new policies, we must carefully model consumer demand by taking into account heavy discounting, inattention, and dissatisfaction behaviors. This drives us to make two methodological contributions. First, we construct a dynamic structural model that incorporates inattention and dissatisfaction into the lifetime consumption model. These modeling components are necessary to accurately predict consumers' reactions to new pricing policies and subsequently assess welfare implications. Structural models have the merit of producing policy-invariant parameters that allow us to conduct counterfactual analyses. However, the inherent computational burden prevents them from being widely adopted by the industry. This leads to our second contribution, whereby we show how to estimate a structural model applied to big data with the help of parallel computing techniques. Our proposed algorithm takes advantage of state-of-the-art parallel computing techniques and estimation methods to lessen the computational burden and reduce the curse of dimensionality to the point where near-real-time results are possible.</p><p>In our counterfactual analysis, we show that a percentage fee or a quantity premium fee strategy can achieve higher bank revenue than the current flat per-transaction fee strategy because of the demand expansion effect and second degree price discrimination effect. Consumers also benefit from the lowered overdraft fees by improving their capabilities to smooth out consumption over time and save monitoring costs. Therefore, all the new pricing strategies can improve social welfare. Moreover, a fixed bill payment schedule can also improve social welfare by saving consumers time in monitoring their accounts. Interestingly, an overdraft waiver for high-balance customers can be a win-win for both consumers and the bank.</p><p>Consumer choice of financial products is an important and enormous area that has been underresearched in marketing. Providing a strong impetus to new topics for research, this journal's publication policy is favorably disposed to even exploratory research efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sudhir 2016)</ref>. We believe that our research is on an important and underresearched area, and that our analysis is far beyond what may be deemed as exploratory.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related research. We report an exploratory data analysis in Section 3 to motivate our model setup. In Section 4, we describe our structural model. We give details about the identification and estimation procedures in Section 5. In Sections 6 and 7, we discuss our estimation results and counterfactual analysis. We conclude in Section 8 with a discussion of our findings and the limitations of our research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>An economic approach to explaining overdrafting would assume that consumers are rational and forward-looking with an objective to maximize their total discounted utility by making optimal choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Modigliani and</ref><ref type="bibr">Brumberg 1954, Hall 1978)</ref>. Consistent with the rational argument for overdrafting is that consumers heavily discount the future and are willing to pay future overdraft fees to allow consumption today. Although we are sympathetic to full information rational models of consumer behavior, we do not want to overlook potential behavioral explanations of overdrafting behavior. Specifically, we consider two novel arguments that offer behavioral explanations concerning overdrafting: inattention and dissatisfaction.</p><p>The inattention argument is present in a large body of literature in psychology and economics, which has found that consumers pay limited attention to relevant information. In their review paper, DellaVigna (2009) summarize findings indicating that consumers pay limited attention to (1) shipping costs, (2) tax <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chetty et al. 2009)</ref>, and (3) rankings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pope 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gabaix and Laibson (2006)</ref> find that consumers do not pay enough attention to addon pricing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Grubb (2014)</ref> shows that consumers are inattentive to their cell-phone minute balances, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ching et al. (2009)</ref> find that consumers only occasionally attend to prices. Many papers in finance and accounting have documented that investors and financial analysts are inattentive to various types of financial information (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hirshleifer and</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Teoh 2003, Peng and Xiong 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Limited attention can also explain overdrafting behaviors, as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stango and Zinman (2014)</ref>. They state that there is survey evidence that people overdraw accounts because "they 'thought there was enough money in my account'" (p. 996). So they define inattention as incomplete consideration of account balances (realized balance and available balance net of upcoming bills) that would inform choices. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stango and Zinman (2014)</ref> use a data set similar to ours, their aim is to show that reminding participants about overdraft fees can reduce the likelihood of overdrafts. We adopt this definition of inattention, but we introduce inattention through a structural parameter, the monitoring cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reis 2006)</ref>, which represents the time and effort required for a consumer to know the exact amount of money in his or her checking account.</p><p>A second behavioral argument related to overdrafting is that it may cause consumer dissatisfaction. The implied interest rate for an overdraft originated by a small transaction amount implies usurious rates that are much higher than the socially accepted interest rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Matzler et al. 2006)</ref>, leading to price dissatisfaction. This is because under current banking practices, consumers pay flat per-transaction fees regardless of the transaction amount. Overdrafting fees may cause consumer dissatisfaction, which is one of the main causes of customer switching behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Keaveney 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bolton 1998</ref>. We conjecture that consumers are likely to close their account after they pay an overdraft fee and/or if the ratio of the overdraft fee to the overdraft transaction amount is high.</p><p>Before posing a formal economic model, we begin with the data and an exploratory data analysis to validate whether there is evidence for high discounting, inattention, and dissatisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data</head><p>We obtain anonymized data from a large U.S. bank. Our data comprise bank transaction data for a sample of more than 500,000 accounts 5 with more than 200 million transactions over a 15-month period (June 2012 to Aug 2013). These data are a by-product of consumers' financial transactions. For each transaction, we know a unique but anonymized account identifier along with the date, channel, amount, and type of the transaction. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides a simulated example of the raw information for a consumer. In this example, the consumer makes an ATM withdrawal and starts with a positive balance. On the next day, a check is paid by the bank even though the consumer has insufficient funds, which triggers an overdraft and the corresponding fee. A direct deposit from salary income is received, which brings the consumer's balance to a positive amount. Subsequently, the consumer does a balance check and makes a purchase at the supermarket on the next day. The description in this example is given for illustrative purposes and is not provided in our data set. Each transaction is classified into one of five categories: bills, fees assessed by the bank, income (from deposits and transfers), spending, and balance inquiries.</p><p>The bank in the data set provides a comprehensive set of services for consumers to avoid overdrafts, such as automatic transfers, but despite these offerings, a significant number of consumers still overdraw. (For a good review of general overdraft practices in the United States, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stango and Zinman (2014)</ref>. Online Appendix A1 tabulates the current fee settings of the top U.S. banks.) If a consumer overdraws his or her account with the standard overdraft service, then the bank might cover the transaction and charge a $31 6 OD or decline the transaction and charge a $31 nonsufficient fund fee (NSF). The bank can accept or decline the transaction at its discretion. The OD/NSF is applied at a per-item level: if a consumer performs several transactions when his or her account is already overdrawn, each transaction item will incur a fee of $31. However, within a day, the total number of per-item fees is capped. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> If the account remains overdrawn for several 8 consecutive calendar days, a continuous overdraft fee of $6 is assessed. The bank also provides an overdraft protection service, where a checking account can be linked to another checking account, a credit card, or a line of credit. In this case, when the focal account is overdrawn, funds can be transferred to cover the negative balance. The overdraft transfer balance fee is $9 for each transfer. In summary, the overdraft fee structure for the bank, as for most others, is quite complicated. In our empirical analysis, we do not distinguish among different types of overdraft fees, and we assume that consumers care only about the total amount of overdraft fees rather than the underlying pricing structure.</p><p>The bank also provides balance-checking services through its branches, ATMs, call centers, and  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, , vol. 37, no. 6, pp. 855-882, © 2018</ref> online/mobile banking service. Consumers can inquire about their available balances and recent activities. There is also a notification service, providing so-called "alerts," that notifies consumers via emails or text messages when certain events take place, such as overdrafts, incidents of insufficient funds, transfers, and deposits. Unfortunately, our data set includes only balance-checking data, not alert data. We discuss this limitation in Section 8. In 2009, the Federal Reserve Board made an amendment to Regulation E (subsequently recodified by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)), which requires account holders to provide affirmative consent (opt in) for overdraft coverage of ATM and nonrecurring point-of-sale (POS) debit card transactions before banks can charge them for paying such transactions. 9 Regulation E was intended to protect consumers from heavy overdraft fees. The change became effective for new accounts on July 1, 2010, and for existing accounts on August 15, 2010. Our data contain both opt-in and opt-out accounts. However, we do not know which accounts have opted in unless we observe an ATM/POS-initiated overdraft incident. We discuss this data limitation in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>In our data set, 15.8% of accounts had at least one overdraft incident. The proportion of accounts with overdrafts is lower than the 27% (across all banks and credit unions) reported by the CFPB in 2012. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that consumers who paid overdraft fees overdrew nearly 10 times and paid $245 on average during the 15-month sample period. This is consistent with the finding from the CFPB that the average overdraft-and NSF-related fees paid by all accounts with one or more overdraft transactions in 2011 totaled $225. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> There is significant heterogeneity in consumers' overdraft frequency, and the distribution of overdraft frequency is quite skewed. The median overdraft frequency is three, and more than 25% of consumers overdrew only once. In contrast, the top 0.15% of the heaviest overdrafters overdrew more than 100 times. A similar skewed pattern is observed for the distribution of overdraft fees. Whereas the median overdraft fee is $77, the top 0.15% of heaviest overdrafters paid more than $2,730 in fees.</p><p>The majority of overdrafters have overdrawn less than 40 times. The first panel in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the distribution of the overdraft frequency and fees conditional upon the accountholder overdrafting at least once during the sample period. Notice that most consumers (&gt;50%) overdraft only once or twice. The second panel shows the distribution censored at $300 for the overdraft fees paid for each accountholder who has overdrawn. Consistent with the fee structure where the standard per-item overdraft fee is $22 or $31, we see spikes at these two numbers and their multiples.</p><p>To better understand what types of transactions trigger an overdraft, we construct a table of the transaction channel that triggers overdrafts. We find (in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) that nearly 50% of overdrafts are caused by debit card purchases with mean transaction amounts of approximately $30. On the other hand, Automated Clearing House (ACH) and check transactions account for 13.77% and 11.68% of overdraft incidents, and these transactions are generally for larger amounts, $294.57 and $417.78, respectively. ATM withdrawals lead to another 3.51% of the overdraft transactions, with an average amount of approximately $90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Exploratory Data Analysis</head><p>This section presents some patterns in the data that suggest the causes and effects of overdrafts. We show that heavy discounting and inattention may drive consumers' overdrafting behavior and that consumers are dissatisfied because of overdraft fees. The model-free evidence also highlights the variation in the data that will allow for the identification of the discount factor, monitoring cost, and dissatisfaction sensitivity.</p><p>3.2.1. Heavy Discounting. First, we conjecture that a consumer may overdraw because of a much greater preference for current consumption than future consumption, this is, the consumer heavily discounts future consumption utility. At the point of sale, such a consumer sharply discounts the future cost of the overdraft fee to satisfy his or her immediate gratification. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> In such a case, we should observe a steep downward sloping trend in the consumer's spending pattern within a pay period; that is, the consumer will increase spending right after he or she receives a pay check and will then reduce spending over the course of the month. However, because of his or her overspending at the beginning of the month, the consumer will run out of funds at the end of the pay period and have to overdraw.</p><p>We test this hypothesis with the following model of spending for consumer i at time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Spending it β * LapsedTimeAf terIncome it + µ i + v t + it ,</formula><p>where LapsedTimeAf terIncome it is the number of days after the consumer received income (salary), µ i is the individual fixed effect, and v t is the time (day) fixed effect. To control for the effect that consumers usually pay for their bills (utilities, phone bills, credit card bills, etc.) after receiving their paycheck, we exclude checks and ACH transactions, which are the common choices for bill payments from daily spending and keep only debit card purchases, ATM withdrawals, and person-to-person transfers.</p><p>We run this ordinary least squares regression separately for heavy overdrafters (whose overdraft frequencies are in the top 20 percentile of all overdrafters), light overdrafters (whose overdraft frequencies are not in the top 20 percentile), and nonoverdrafters (who do not overdraw during the 15-month sample period). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The results are reported in columns (1)-(3) of Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 6, pp. 855-882, © 2018</ref> We find that the coefficient of LapsedTimeAfterIncome it is negative and significant for heavy overdrafters but not light overdrafters or nonoverdrafters. This suggests that heavy overdrafters have a steep downward sloping spending pattern during a pay period, whereas light overdrafters or nonoverdrafters have a relatively stable spending stream. The heavy overdrafters are likely to overdraw because of their heavy discounting of future consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Inattention.</head><p>Next, we consider why light overdrafters may overdraft due to inattention. The idea is that consumers might not always monitor their account balance and may be uncertain about the exact balance amount. Sometimes, the perceived balance can be higher than the true balance, and this might cause an overdraft. We first present a representative example of consumer inattention. The example is based on our data, but to protect the privacy of the consumer and the merchants, the amounts have been changed. However, the example remains representative of the underlying data.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the consumer first received his or her biweekly salary on August 17. After a series of expenses, the consumer is left with $21.16 on August 20. The consumer did not check his or her balance but continued spending and overdrew the account for several small purchases, including a $25 restaurant bill, a $17.12 beauty purchase, a $6.31 game, and a $4.95 coffee purchase. These four transactions totaled only $53.38 but caused the consumer to pay four overdraft item fees for total fees of $124. We speculate that this consumer was careless in monitoring his or her account and overestimated his or her balance. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Beyond this example, we find more evidence of inattention in the data. To start off, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> suggests that debit card purchases cause the most overdraft incidences, perhaps because it is more difficult to check balances when using a debit card than using an ATM or ACH.</p><p>Moreover, intuitively, as direct support of our hypothesis regarding inattention, the less frequently a consumer checks his or her balance, the more overdraft fees the consumer will likely incur. To test this hypothesis, we estimate the following specification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">TotODPmt it β 0 + β 1 BCFreq it + µ i + v t + it ,</formula><p>where TotODPmt it is the total overdraft payment, and BCFreq it is the balance-checking frequency for consumer i at time t (month).</p><p>We estimate this model on light overdrafters (whose overdraft frequency is not in the top 20 percentile) and heavy overdrafters (whose overdraft frequency is in the top 20 percentile) separately, and report the result in columns (1) and (2) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.</p><p>The result suggests that a higher frequency of balance checking decreases the overdraft payment for light overdrafters but not for heavy overdrafters. We further test this effect by including the overdraft frequency (ODFreq it ) and an interaction term for balancechecking frequency and overdraft frequency BCFreq it * ODFreq it in the equation below. The idea is that if the coefficient for this interaction term is positive while the coefficient for balance-checking frequency (BCFreq it ) is negative, then it implies that a high frequency of balance checking decreases overdraft fees only for consumers who overdraw infrequently, not for those who overdraw frequently:  The results in column (3) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> confirm our hypothesis. 15 Interestingly, we find that consumers' balance perception error accumulates over time in the sense that the greater the time elapsed without checking their balance, the more likely they are to overdraw and consequently pay higher amounts in overdraft fees. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> exhibits the overdraft probability across the number of days elapsed since the last time a consumer checked his or her balance for light overdrafters (whose overdraft frequency is not in the top 20 percentile). As the figure shows, the overdraft probability increases moderately with the number of days elapsed since the last balance check.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">TotODPmt it β 0 + β 1 BCFreq it + β 2 ODFreq i + β 3 BCFreq it * ODFreq i + v t + it .</formula><p>We confirm this relationship with the following two specifications. We assume that the overdraft incidence I(OD) it (where I(OD) it 1 denotes overdraft and I(OD) it 0 denotes no overdraft) and overdraft fee payment amount ODFee it for consumer i at time t can be modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I(OD) it Φ(ρ 0 + ρ 1 DaysSinceLastBalanceCheck it + ρ 2 BeginBal it + µ i + v t ), ODFee it ρ 0 + ρ 1 DaysSinceLastBalanceCheck it + ρ 2 BeginBal it + µ i + v t + it ,</formula><p>where Φ is the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal distribution. The term DaysSinceLastBalance Check it denotes the number of days that consumer i has not checked his or her balance until time t, and BeginBal it is the beginning balance at time t. We control for the beginning balance because it may be negatively correlated with the days elapsed since last balance check because consumers tend to check their balance when it is low, and a lower balance often leads to an overdraft. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> reports the estimation results, which support our hypothesis that the greater the time elapsed after a balance check, the more likely the consumer is to overdraw and incur higher overdraft fees. If balance checking can help prevent overdrafts, why do consumers not check their balance more frequently and avoid overdraft fees? We argue that there exists a monitoring cost because monitoring account balance is costly in terms of time, effort and mental resources, which reduces the number of balance checks. In the data, we find that consumers with online banking accounts check their balances more frequently than those without online banking accounts, suggesting that monitoring costs exist and that consumers monitor their account more frequently when these costs are reduced. Please see the details in Online Appendix A2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Dissatisfaction.</head><p>We find that overdrafts might cause consumers to close their accounts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>). Among nonoverdrafters, 7.87% closed their accounts during the sample period. This ratio is much higher for overdrafters. Specifically, 23.36% of heavy overdrafters (whose overdraft frequency is in the top 20 percentile) closed their accounts, whereas 10.56% of light overdrafters (whose overdraft frequency is not in the top 20 percentile) closed their accounts.</p><p>From the description field associated with each account, we can distinguish the cause of account closure: forced closure by the bank because the consumer is unable or unwilling to pay back the overdrawn balance and fees (in which case the bank executes a charge-off) versus voluntary closure. Among heavy overdrafters, 13.66% closed their accounts voluntarily, and the remaining 86.34% were forced by the bank to close their accounts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>). In contrast, 47.42% of the light overdrafters closed their accounts voluntarily. We conjecture that the higher voluntary closures among light overdrafters may be due to customer dissatisfaction with the bank, as the evidence below shows.</p><p>First, we find that overdrafters who voluntarily closed their accounts were very likely to close soon after the last overdraft. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, we plot the histogram of the number of days it took the account to close after the last overdraft incident. As the figure shows, more than 60% of accounts closed within 30 days after the last overdraft incident.</p><p>Second, light overdrafters are also more likely to close their accounts when the ratio of the overdraft fee to the transaction amount that caused the overdraft fee is higher. In other words, the higher the ratio of the overdraft amount, the more likely a consumer will be to close his or her account. We show this pattern in the left panel of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. However, this effect does not seem to be present for heavy overdrafters (right panel of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Model</head><p>Our exploratory data analysis indicates that heavy discounting and inattention can help explain consumers' overdrafting behavior and that consumers' dissatisfaction due to overdraft fees contributes to their attrition. Ultimately, our goal is to predict the overdraft incidence for each consumer on a daily basis. To do so, we develop a structural model that incorporates discounting, inattention, and dissatisfaction. This is a dynamic model in which consumers make daily decisions about how to spend their funds, whether to check their balance, and whether to close their account. We assume that consumers are rational and forward looking, <ref type="bibr">16</ref> with an objective to maximize their total discounted utility by making optimal choices. As by-products of this model, we make a prediction about the likelihood of an overdraft on any given day for each consumer as well as the consumer's tenure and profitability with the bank.</p><p>The timing of the events for our model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. On each day for every consumer, the model has seven steps. First, the consumer receives income (if any). Second, the consumer's bills arrive (if any).   Third, the consumer decides whether to check his or her balance. If the consumer inquiries about his or her balance, then the beginning balance and bills for the day are known with complete certainty; otherwise, the consumer forms an estimate of both the beginning balance and the bill amount. Fourth, the consumer makes discretionary spending decisions and spends or consumes this amount. At this stage, the consumer chooses consumption (C) to maximize the total discounted utility (V) if the consumer chooses to check the balance or chooses it to maximize the expected discounted utility (E[V]) if the balance is not checked. Fifth, an overdraft fee is assessed by the bank if the ending balance is below zero. Sixth, the bank decides whether to force the account to close. Based on the bank's risk assessment, if the account is associated with high risk activities, it will be forced to close and the consumer will get zero utility (normalized). The bank will incur a default cost, which equals the negative balance of the account, in this case. Seventh, the consumer decides whether to close  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, , vol. 37, no. 6, pp. 855-882, © 2018</ref> the account (after paying any overdraft fees). If the consumer closes his or her account, then an outside option is received and the model ends. Otherwise, in the eighth step, the balance is updated, and the cycle of events is repeated daily. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> To fully implement this multistage model, we have to specify a number of components concerning utility. To make it easier for the reader to follow the specification of the model, we do not start with its full specification, but instead build up the model starting with the utility from consumption in Section 4.1. We then incorporate adjustments to utility of not knowing the balance with certainty, which incorporates monitoring costs that capture inattention in Section 4.2. Finally, we introduce dissatisfaction with overdraft fees into utility in Section 4.3 so that we can predict not only when overdrafts occur but also when consumers will close their accounts. The full dynamic programming problem that considers the net present value of utility for an individual consumer is presented in Sections 4.4 and 4.5. Finally, we consider how heterogeneity across consumers can be specified in Section 4.6 to complete the full specification of the model. The estimation of the model is discussed in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Consumption Model</head><p>At the core of our model is the need to predict consumers' daily decisions about how much to consume today versus in the future. Following the lifetime consumption literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Modigliani and</ref><ref type="bibr">Brumberg 1954, Hall 1978</ref>), we assume that consumer i's per-period consumption utility at time t is determined by a constant relative risk averse (CRRA) utility function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arrow 1963)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u C (C it ) C 1−θ it it 1 − θ it ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where C it 18 is consumer i's consumption at period t, and θ it is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. We choose the CRRA utility function because it has the merits of empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Friend and Blume 1975)</ref>, analytical convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Merton 1992)</ref>, and is commonly used in the economics literature. The coefficient of relative risk θ it is the intertemporal substitution elasticity between consumption in any two adjacent periods. Higher values for θ it imply greater utility from each marginal unit of consumption and a lower willingness to substitute today's consumption for future consumption.</p><p>Given that consumers might overdraw because of emergency expenses, for example, medical bills, car repairs, or expensive group dinners, we allow θ it to vary each period according to a random shock term ε it to capture these unexpected needs for consumption. Large positive values of ε it will result in increased marginal utilities of consumption, representing days when urgent expenses are due. Specifically, we allow θ it to follow a log-normal distribution with a time-invariant location θ i and a random shock ε it . The shock ε it follows a normal distribution with mean zero and variance ς 2 i <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yao et al. 2012</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ it exp(θ i + ε it ), ε it~N (0, ς 2 i ).</formula><p>The consumption plan captured by C it depends on the consumer's budget constraint, which is a function of the consumer's current balance B it , income Y it , and bills Ψ it . Bills represent preauthorized spending that relates to medium-or long-run consumption expenditures such as loan, rent, or utility payments. We model bills separately 19 from consumption because preauthorized spending is difficult to change on a daily basis after it is authorized, whereas consumption is more likely to be the result of consumers' day-to-day decisions. Consumers' budget constraints are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">B it+1 B it − C it − OD it * I(B it − C it &lt; 0) + Y it+1 − ψ it+1 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The next day's available balance B it+1 is equal to the current balance B it minus current consumption C it and overdraft fees OD it (if the balance becomes negative, denoted by (B it − C it &lt; 0)) plus the next day's net income after bills, given by the difference of Y it+1 and ψ it+1 . Note that because we model consumers' spending decisions at the daily level rather than the transaction level, we aggregate all overdraft fees paid and assume that consumers know the per-item fee structure 20 stated in Section 3 when deciding their daily consumption; that is, OD it is not the per-item overdraft fee ($31 for our focal bank), but the daily sum of all per-item overdraft fees. Thus, OD it can take a value such as $62, $93, or $124. Because our focus is overdrafting behavior, we make a number of assumptions to render our problem tractable. First, consumption is not observed in our data; therefore, we make the assumption that spending is equivalent to consumption in terms of generating utility. Hereafter, we use consumption and spending interchangeably. Second, we abstract away from the complexity associated with our data and assume that the consumer's income and bills are exogenously determined. In our data set, we are able to distinguish bills from spending using their transaction channels, as illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For example, bills are associated with checks and ACH and bill payments, whereas spending is associated with debit cards and cash withdrawals. Note that although credit card spending is discretionary, we treat it as a bill because it affects the checking account balance only when the consumer pays the bill rather than when the consumer swipes the credit card each time. Thus, credit card spending does not cause any immediate overdrafts, whereas debit card purchases may. It is for this reason that we treat credit card and debit card spending differently. The main focus of our paper is to examine overdrafts. Thus, the transactions are modeled according to the extent that they affect overdrafts. Third, we assume that bills are not within consumers' daily discretion but that spending (or, more precisely, nonpreauthorized spending) can be adjusted daily. In summary, we model consumers' consumption decisions, where consumption is nonpreauthorized spending 21 from their checking accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Inattention and Monitoring Costs</head><p>Our reduced-form evidence in Section 3.2.2 suggests that because of monitoring costs, consumers are inattentive to their financial well-being. This is consistent with the theory of rational inattention <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sims 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sims , 2003</ref> that individuals have many things to think about and limited time, and they can devote only limited intellectual resources to these tasks of data gathering and analysis. Because monitoring an account balance 22 takes time and effort, a consumer may not check his balance frequently enough to avoid overdrafts. To capture this effect, we assume that consumers are rational inattentive <ref type="bibr">23</ref> in the sense that they are aware of their own inattention and may choose to be inattentive if monitoring costs are high <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grubb 2014)</ref>. Specifically, we model consumers' balance-checking behavior as a binary choice: Q it ∈ {1,0}, where 1 denotes the decision to check the balance and 0 denotes the decision not to check.</p><p>The balance-checking activity affects the consumer's balance perception B ιt . As shown in Equation (2), the available balance B ιt+1 is the income net of preauthorized bills ψ it+1 . We assume that consumers are not fully aware of the bill arrival timing and amount. For example, because of the business day schedule, a credit card bill might arrive on any day in the last few days of a month or the first few days of a month. And the amount of a utility bill may vary by season. Therefore consumers have uncertainty of the exact bill, and henceforth the available balance. On the one hand, if a consumer checks his balance by incurring a monitoring cost (to be explained later), then the available balance B it Liu, Montgomery, and Srinivasan: Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 6, pp. 855-882, © 2018</ref> will be known with certainty. On the other hand, if the consumer does not check his balance, he will recall a perceived balance, which gives a noisy measure of true balance; 24 that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B ιt B it if Q it 1, B ιt~N (B it + η it ω it , ω 2 it ) if Q it 0. (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mehta et al. (2004)</ref>, we allow the perceived balance B ιt when the balance is not checked to be a normally distributed random variable. The mean of B ιt is the sum of the true balance B it and a perception error: η it ω it . The first component of the perception error η it is a random draw from the standard normal distribution, <ref type="bibr">25</ref> and the second component is the standard deviation of the perception error, ω it . The variance of B ιt is ω 2 t , which measures the extent of uncertainty. For notational convenience, we introduce a variable Γ it that measures the time (number of days) elapsed since the consumer last checked the balance. By definition, Γ it+1 (1 + Γ it )(1 − Q it ); that is, if a consumer checks the balance (Q it 1), then the time lapsed since last balance check is 0, but if the consumer does not check the balance (Q it 0), the time elapsed increases by one day. Based on the evidence from our exploratory data analysis, we allow the extent of uncertainty of the perceived balance to accumulate over time, which implies that the longer a consumer goes without checking his balance, the more inaccurate the perceived balance will be. We formulate this statement as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ω 2 it ρ i Γ it , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where Γ t denotes the time elapsed since the consumer last checked his balance and ρ denotes the sensitivity to the time elapsed since the last balance check. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Recall that a consumer incurs the monitoring cost to check the balance. The monitoring cost is an opportunity cost, not an explicit cost charged by the bank. Formally, we calculate the consumption utility based on this monitoring cost:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">u t (C it , Q it , B ιt ) u C (C it , B ιt ) − Q it ξ i + χ itQ it , (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where ξ i is the consumer's monitoring cost, and χ itQ it is the idiosyncratic shock that affects his monitoring cost.</p><p>The shock χ itQ it can capture idiosyncratic events such as vacations, during which it is difficult for consumers to monitor their balances, or it could capture increased awareness about consumers' financial states from other events such as online bill payments, which automatically report their balances.

The optimal spending will maximize his expected utility, which is calculated by integrating over the balance perception error:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">u it u t (C it , Q it , B ιt )dF(η it )dF( B ιt ).

This relationship arises because greater variance in the perception error decreases the accuracy of the consumer's estimate of his true balance and thus increases the likelihood that he will mistakenly overdraw his account, which lowers his utility. The derivation is shown in a technical report available from the authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Forced Closure</head><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref> suggests, the bank often forces an account to close once an overdraft occurs. Therefore, when a consumer overdraws, he faces the risk of being forced out of the bank. To take this into account, we add the probability of forced closure into the model and denote it by π f . Specifically, after a consumer decides how much to consumer or spend (C), if an overdraft occurs, he faces a lottery of forced closure. With probability π f he will be forced to leave the bank and obtain the outside option 1 (to be differentiated from the other outside option 2 after voluntary closure; we normalize the outside option 1 to be 0), whereas with probability 1 − π f the bank will keep the account open and the consumer will make the next decision of whether to voluntarily close the account. We found the data evidence that an account is more likely to be forced to close when the overdraft payment due is high. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Therefore, we model π f κ i * OD it , 28 and κ i is the parameter to be estimated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Dissatisfaction and Account Closing</head><p>The exploratory analysis in Section 3.2.3 suggests that overdrafts trigger consumer dissatisfaction and attrition. We model attrition as consumers choosing an outside option of closing their account and switching to a competing bank or becoming unbanked. Based on the data pattern in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we make an assumption that consumers are sensitive to the ratio of the overdraft fee to the overdraft transaction amount, and we use Ξ it to denote this ratio as a state variable. We assume that a larger ratio indicates a higher likelihood that the consumer will be dissatisfied, because the ratio is essentially the implicit price (interest rate) of overdrafts, and prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Keaveney 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bolton 1998</ref> has documented that a high price may cause consumer dissatisfaction. Forward-looking consumers anticipate the accumulation of dissatisfaction (as well as lost consumption utility due to overdrafts) in the future and will become more likely to close their accounts. Furthermore, we assume that consumers formulate their belief of the ratio for a future period based on the highest ratio they have personally incurred; 29 that is, if we use Δ it to denote the per-period ratio, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Δ it OD it | B ιt − C it | ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">E[Ξ it+1 |Ξ it ] max(Ξ it , Δ it ).

This assumption also reflects consumers' learning behavior over time. Consider a consumer who experiences many overdrafts; our model captures the idea that his dissatisfaction grows with each overdraft.</p><p>To introduce dissatisfaction from overdrafts into the model, we calculate the per-period utility:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">U ιt u it − Υ i * max(Ξ it , Δ it ) * I[ B ιt − C it &lt; 0].</formula><p>In the above equation, u it is defined as in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">6</ref>), and Υ i is the dissatisfaction sensitivity, that is, the impact of charging an overdraft fee on a consumer's decision to close the account. As in Equation (6), we integrate out the balance perception error to get the expected utility:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">U it U ιt (C it , Q it , B ιt )dF(η it )dF( B ιt ). (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>We assume that the decision to close the account is a terminal decision. Once a consumer chooses to close his or her account, their value function (or total discounted utility function) equals an outside option with a mean value of α i , normalized to be the same across states for identification purposes. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> If the consumer keeps the account open, continuation values from future per-period utility functions will continue to be received. More specifically, let W i denote a consumer's choice to close his or her account, where W i 1 denotes the decision to close the account before the period starts, and W i 0 denotes the decision to keep the account open for this period. Then, the value function for the consumer becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">V it {U it +ˆi t0 + β i E[V it+1 |S it ]}{(1 − π f ) * I[ B ιt − C it &lt; 0] + I[ B ιt − C it ≥ 0]}, W it 0 α i +ˆi t1 , W it 1 (9)</formula><p>whereˆi t0 andˆi t1 are the idiosyncratic shocks that determine a consumer's account-closing decision. Sources of shocks may include events such as when the consumer moves out of town or when a competing bank enters the market. We assume that these shocks follow a type I extreme value distribution. Note that even when a consumer decides to keep the account open, the bank might force the account to close with probability π f when the account is overdrawn. So, in expectation, the consumer's value function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">{U it +ˆi t0 + β i E[V it+1 |S it ]} {(1 − π f ) * I[ B ιt − C it &lt; 0] + I[ B ιt − C it ≥ 0]}.</formula></div>

The support vector contains multiples of the per-item overdraft fee. Bills. Our data suggests that the bills arrival dates vary considerably. For example, depending on the business day schedule, monthly credit card bills can arrive on any day between the 27th day of the month and 3rd day of the consecutive month. In addition, even when the date is fixed, the amount varies. For example, in many areas, utility bills in the winter are much higher than those in the summer. Given the stochastic nature of the timing and amount of bills, we treat bill arrival dates as a random variable, which we model as a Poisson process. Specifically, bills are assumed to be i.i.d. draws from a compound Poisson distribution with arrival rate φ i and with a jump size distribution G i : Ψ it~C P(φ i , G i ). This distribution can capture the pattern of bills arriving randomly according to a Poisson process, and bill sizes are sums of fixed components (each separate bill). <ref type="bibr">32</ref> This model setup is consistent with the lifetime consumption model with unanticipated and transitory income shocks. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> When consumers move money from a savings account to a checking account, this is recorded as a negative bill, which increases the available budget. Savings (and ATM deposits) are modeled in the same way as bills. This is because in the data, savings are recorded as either cross-institution ACH transactions or within-bank transfers, similarly to bills. Moreover, we treat savings similarly to bills because, although both generate consumption utility for consumers, they are usually preauthorized and do not cause any immediate overdrafts. People usually do not make retirement and other long-term savings decisions on a daily basis. However, overdrafts result from negative balances on a daily level. The main purpose of our paper is to examine overdrafts. Thus, transactions are modeled based on the extent to which they affect overdrafts.</p><p>Dissatisfaction.

First, given the budget constraint, a consumer will evaluate the utility of spending (or consuming) today versus tomorrow. Higher spending today implies lower spending in the future. Therefore, spending is a dynamic decision, and the optimal choice for the consumer is to smooth out his or her consumption over time. Second, when deciding when to check his or her balance, the consumer compares the monitoring cost with the expected gain from avoiding an overdraft fee. The consumer checks his or her balance only when the expected overdraft fee is higher than the monitoring cost. Because the consumer's balance perception error might accumulate over time, the consumer's overdraft probability also increases as more time elapses since the last balance check. As a result, the consumer waits until the overdraft probability reaches a certain threshold (when the expected overdraft fee equals the monitoring cost) before checking the balance. Finally, the decision to close the account is an optimal stopping problem. The consumer will compare the total discounted utility of keeping the account with the utility from the outside option to close the account. When the consumer expects to incur many overdraft fees and the accompanying dissatisfaction, the consumer finds it more attractive to take the outside option and close his or her account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Heterogeneity</head><p>In our data, consumers exhibit different responses to their state conditions. For example, some consumers have never checked their balance and frequently overdraw, whereas other consumers frequently check their balance and rarely overdraw. We hypothesize that these differences result from their heterogeneous discount factors and monitoring costs. Therefore, our model needs to account for unobserved heterogeneity. We follow a hierarchical Bayesian framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rossi et al. 2005)</ref> and incorporate heterogeneity into the model by assuming that all parameters, namely, θ i (mean relative risk averse coefficient), β i (discount factor), ς i (standard deviation of the coefficient of risk aversion), ξ i (monitoring cost), ρ i (sensitivity of the error variance to the time elapsed since the last balance check), Υ i (dissatisfaction sensitivity), and α i (mean value of the outside option) each have a random coefficient specification. The subscript i denotes the consumer, and the previous models are understood to be defined by the customer. For each of these parameters, θ ∈ {θ i , β i , ς i , ξ i , ρ i , Υ i , α i , κ i }, the prior distribution is defined as θ~N(µ ϑ , σ 2 ϑ ). The hyper-prior distribution is assumed to be diffuse.</p></div>

We provide the rationale for the identification of each parameter.</p><p>We know from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rust (1987)</ref> that the discount factor β i cannot be separately identified from the static utility parameter, which is the risk aversion coefficient in our case. The reason is that lowering θ i tends to increase consumption/spending, an effect that can also be achieved by lowering β i . Because we are more interested in consumers' time preference than their risk preference, we fix the risk aversion coefficient, which allows us to identify the discount factor. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> This practice is also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gopalakrishnan et al. (2014)</ref>. Following the latest research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andersen et al. (2008)</ref>, who jointly elicit risk and time preferences, we choose θ i θ 0.74 for the coefficient of risk aversion. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> After we fix θ i , β i can be well identified by the sequences of consumption (spending) within a pay period. A large discount factor (close to 1) implies a stable consumption stream, whereas a small discount factor implies a downward-sloping consumption stream. Because a discount factor is constrained above by 1, we take a logit transformation, namely, β i 1 1+exp(λ i ) , and estimate the transformed parameter λ i instead.</p><p>The standard deviation of the coefficient risk aversion ς i is identified by the variation of consumptions on the same day of the pay period but across different pay periods. Moreover, according to the intertemporal tradeoff, the longer the consumer goes without checking his or her balance, the more likely an overdraft is to occur because of a balance error. Therefore, the observed data pattern of higher overdraft fees paid for a longer period after the balance is checked can inform the structural parameter ρ i .</p><p>Intuitively, the monitoring cost ξ i is identified by the expected overdraft payment amount. Recall that the trade-off regarding balance checking is that a consumer checks his or her balance only when ξ i is smaller than the expected overdraft payment amount. In the data, we observe the balance-checking frequency. By combining this with the calculated ρ i , we can compute the expected overdraft probability and then the expected overdraft payment amount, which is the identified ξ i . Given ρ i , a consumer with few balance-checking inquiries must have a higher balance-checking cost ξ i . The dissatisfaction sensitivity parameter Υ i can be identified by the data pattern where consumers' account closure probability varies with the ratio of the overdraft fee to the overdraft transaction amount, as shown in our exploratory data analysis (Section 3.2.3). Last, the mean value of the outside option α i can be identified by the average voluntary account closing probability, and κ i can be identified by the variation of the forced closure probability with respect to the variation of overdraft fee payment.</p><p>Note that aside from these structural parameters, another set of parameters governs the transition process.

Second, we apply the model to a large data set, so the estimation is computationally challenging. Fortunately, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be combined with a parallel computing technique to reduce the computational burden. Third, the IJC algorithm is the state-of-the-art Bayesian estimation algorithm for infinite horizon dynamic programming models. The IJC algorithm provides two additional benefits in tackling the computational challenges. One is that it alleviates the computational burden by evaluating the value function only once in each epoch. Essentially, the algorithm solves the value function and estimates the structural parameters simultaneously. Thus, the computational burden of a dynamic problem is reduced by an order of magnitude with computational costs similar to a static model. The other is that the method reduces the curse of dimensionality by allowing state space grid points to vary between estimation iterations.</p></div>

We instead use a new technique developed by <ref type="bibr">Neiswanger et al. (2014) (hereafter, NWX)</ref> to address this problem. The key idea of this algorithm is that the data can be distributed into multiple machines, and the IJC estimation can be performed in parallel.

We provide a sketch of our estimation procedure and refer the reader to Online Appendix A3 for more details. The whole parameter space is divided into two sets (Ω {Ω 1 , Ω 2 }), where the first one contains the set of hyperparameters (Ω 1 {µ λ , µ ς ,µ ξ ,µ ρ ,µ Υ ,µ α , σ λ ,σ ς , σ ξ , σ ρ , σ Υ , σ α }), and the second set contains the set of heterogeneous param-</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">eters (Ω 2 {λ i , ς i , ξ i , ρ i ,Υ i , α i } I i 1 )</formula><p>.

Models A, B, and C are special cases of our proposed model without forward looking, inattention, and unobserved heterogeneity, respectively. Model D is our proposed model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref> shows the log-marginal density <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kass and Raftery 1995)</ref> and the hit rate for incidents of overdrafting, balance checking, and account closing. (We only compare these events because nonincidents are so prevalent. The hit rates for nonincidents are given in Online Appendix A5.) All four measures show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the benchmark models. Notably, inattention contributes the most to the model fit, which is consistent with our conjecture in Section 3.2.</p></div>

The first column shows the performance of our proposed method, the IJC method with the parallel computing technique developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Neiswanger et al. (2014)</ref>. We compare this method with the traditional parallel computing method M-IJC (Murray 2010), the original IJC method, the conditional choice probability method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arcidiacono and Miller (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">41</ref> and the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rust (1987)</ref> (or nested fixed point algorithm). <ref type="bibr">42</ref> As the sample size increases, the comparative advantage of our proposed method is more notable. Running the model on the full data set with more than 500,000 accounts takes approximately 1.5 hours, whereas running the original IJC method takes nine days. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> Our method takes less time because it takes advantage of multiple cores that run in parallel, whereas the other algorithms have not been designed to run in parallel and use only one core. The NWX-IJC method is also nearly four times faster than the traditional parallel computing method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Murray 2010)</ref> because the traditional parallel computing method is running on the entire data set. Once all the chains converge, we can pick samples from all the chains instead of a single chain to speed up sampling. However, the speedup occurs only after convergence. The time of burnin cannot be reduced. Instead, the NWX parallel computing method runs only on a subset of the data on each machine. So, the burn-in time can also be saved (in addition to the speedup after convergence). The NWX-IJC method is almost 600 times faster than the FIML method. This is because the full solution FIML method solves the dynamic programming problem at each candidate value for the parameter estimates, whereas this IJC estimator only evaluates the value function once for each iteration.</p><p>We further run a simulation study to determine whether the various methods are able to accurately estimate all parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Parameter Estimates</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref> presents the results of the structural model. We find that the daily discount factor is approximately 0.9997. This is equivalent to a yearly discount factor of 0.89, which is largely consistent with the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hartmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">Nair 2010, Fang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Wang 2015)</ref>. The standard deviation of the discount factor is 0.363. This suggests that some consumers have quite low discount factors-consistent with our heavy discounting hypothesis. The monitoring cost is estimated to be 4.605. Using the coefficient of risk aversion, we can evaluate the monitoring cost in monetary terms to be $2. In other words, consumers behave as if checking their balance costs them $2. (We can also obtain the cost measure for each individual consumer.)</p><p>The variance of the balance perception error increases with the time elapsed since the last balance check and with the mean balance level. Notably, the variance in the balance perception error is quite large. If we take the average number of days to check the balance from the data, which is 9, then the standard deviation is 7.860 × 9 = 70.74. This suggests that the balance perception error has a diffuse distribution.</p><p>The estimated dissatisfaction sensitivity parameters confirm our hypothesis that consumers can be strongly affected by overdraft fees and close their accounts because of dissatisfaction. If we consider an average overdraft transaction amount of $33, then the relative magnitude of the effect of dissatisfaction is comparable to $171. This suggests that unless the bank would like to offer $171 in compensation to consumers, dissatisfied consumers will close their current accounts and choose the outside option. Moreover, consistent with our exploratory data analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), the dissatisfaction sensitivity is stronger for light overdrafters (whose average is 5.911) than for heavy overdrafters (whose average is 3.387). Keeping the average overdraft transaction amount fixed, a 1% increase in the overdraft fee can increase the closing probability by 0.12%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Smaller Sample Sizes</head><p>This large data set used in the analysis is necessary for several reasons. First, compared with numerous other types of transactions, overdrafts are relatively rare events. Without a large amount of data, we cannot detect these rare but detrimental events, let alone understand and predict their diverse causes. Second, as shown in Section 3 of this paper, we find that consumers exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their spending behavior, cause of overdraft, monitoring cost, and dissatisfaction sensitivity. Because consumer heterogeneity is highdimensional, the big data allow us to capture this rich consumer heterogeneity in a much more refined fashion. Third, a selected subset might suffer from sampling error or sample bias. Because consumer behaviors and characteristics are high-dimensional, it is difficult to collect an accurate, random and representative sample. To illustrate the potential sampling error, we present the estimated parameters for randomly selected samples of 1,000 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13</ref>) and 50,000 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">14</ref>) consumers.</p><p>The comparison indicates that without the full sample, the majority of the coefficients will become statistically insignificant, and heterogeneity will been underestimated by to very large extent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Alternative Pricing Strategies</head><p>Our structural model allows us to examine counterfactual studies that consider the effect of changing the pricing structure on consumers' spending patterns and, more importantly, their overdrafting behavior. We Liu, Montgomery, and Srinivasan: Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data test the effect of three alternative pricing schemes, namely, a reduced per-item flat fee, a percentage fee, and a quantity premium. We provide the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">15</ref>. We make two assumptions for all these simulations. One is fungibility, that is, a consumer's reaction depends only on the fee amount rather than the fee structure. If two different fee structures result in the same fee amount, then consumers should respond in the same fashion. The other is the universal dissatisfaction effect. We assume that consumers' dissatisfaction effect is proportional to the ratio of the overdraft fee to the transaction amount, despite the fee structure. It is possible that consumers will be less dissatisfied with alternative pricing schemes, such as a percentage fee, because they may be perceived as more fair <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bolton et al. 2003)</ref>. However, we argue that rational consumers discover the commonality between different pricing strategies and react to only the essential factor (implicit price) that triggers dissatisfaction. In the first scenario, we keep the per-item flat fee scheme but reduce it to $29.27 per item. Consistent with the law of demand, there is a negative relationship between the per-item overdraft fee and the overdraft frequency. Our choice of $29.27 is the solution of the optimal per-item fee to maximize the sum of the expected profit.</p><p>Expected profit is revenue minus cost. Revenue is the sum of revenue across our entire sample for a one-year period, and it includes overdraft fees and consumers' lifetime value. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> For convenience, we define this sum as the total revenue. Because we aggregate data to the daily level, we calculate the average transaction amount for each item, which is $44, and we use it to derive the total overdraft fee amount. For example, if a consumer overspent by $170, then the consumer would incur four overdraft item fees. Cost is defined as the default cost, which is the negative balances owed by consumers who defaulted. We ignore other costs, like the labor costs to handle consumer complaints, costs for the customer service team to waive fees for some transactions, and so forth, because they are relatively small compared with the default cost and hard to measure. The profit calculation is a nested algorithm that searches for the peritem overdraft fee in the outer loop, and that solves the consumer's best response in terms of optimal spending, balance checking, and account closing, given the fee size in the inner loop. We found that the optimal peritem overdraft fee is $29.27, which would increase the bank's revenue by 2.35%. This suggests that the current overdraft fee is too high, because the bank fails to take into account consumers' negative reactions to overdraft fees, which results in a huge loss in consumers' lifetime value. In other words, at the original per-transaction price, demand is in the elastic region. Reducing it could increase the total revenue. Notice that for nonoverdrafters, the account closing frequency increases because some of them start paying overdraft fees and, hence, become dissatisfied. Therefore, the interest revenue decreases under the reduced flat fee.</p><p>In the second scenario, the per-item flat fee is converted into a percentage fee of 15.8% (solved in a similar way as described in the first scenario). This is lower than the 17% calculated from the ratio of the total fee paid to the total transaction amount that caused the fee in the data. Again, this suggests that the bank's current overdraft fees might be too high. Intuitively, the percentage structure should encourage consumers to overdraw on transactions with small amounts but deter them from overdrawing on transactions with large amounts. Because there are more transactions with small amounts than transactions with large amounts, the total revenue generated soars by 3.11%. Therefore, the percentage overdraft fee invites more consumers to use the overdraft service. It is this market expansion effect that increases the bank's overdraft revenue. At the segment level, the    <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, , vol. 37, no. 6, pp. 855-882, © 2018</ref> overdraft frequency for nonoverdrafters and light overdrafters increases, whereas the overdraft frequency for heavy overdrafters decreases. This is because nonoverdrafters and light overdrafters are mainly overdrawing with transactions of small amounts, which benefit from a lower cost under the percentage fee. In contrast, heavy overdrafters suffer from a higher fee because they overdraw primarily with large transaction amounts.</p><p>In the last scenario, a quantity premium structure is employed. Specifically, when a consumer overdraws fewer than 10 times, the consumer pays an 8.5% percentage fee, but once 10 overdrafts occur, each overdraft incurs a flat fee of $31. This quantity premium increases the bank's revenue by 5.59%. The motivation for this fee structure is to charge a quantity premium after seconddegree price discrimination in which we segment light and heavy overdrafters. The bank would earn more in overdraft fees from the heavy overdrafters, who are willing to pay for the flat fee, but retain the lifetime value for the light overdrafters, who prefer the percentage fee (because of their high dissatisfaction sensitivity). Different from the percentage fee, under the quantity premium, the overdraft revenue from heavy overdrafters also increases because the fee is capped for them. Interestingly, across the three strategies, the balancechecking frequency of heavy overdrafters remains largely unchanged. This is because they overdraw primarily because of heavy discounting rather than inattention due to their low monitoring cost. For nonoverdrafters and light overdrafters, the three new strategies all decrease their balance-checking frequency, because when their fees become lower, there is less incentive for them to check their balances. Furthermore, the reduced flat fee and percentage fee both lead to a drop of interest revenue, but the quantity premium leads to a rise in interest revenue because the light overdrafters are not likely to close their accounts under this pricing strategy. As to welfare effects, both the consumer surplus and the social surplus increase under all three strategies. The increase in consumer welfare comes from reduced fees as well as lower monitoring costs incurred by consumers. 45</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Fixed Bills</head><p>In our model, the income uncertainty primarily comes from the volatility of bills because their varied arrival dates and amounts. In fact, consumers can avoid these unnecessary uncertainties by fixing their bill arrival dates and amounts. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> In this counterfactual, we test how welfare is changes when all consumers have a fixed bill arrival date and the same amount in each pay period. The exact arrival date and bill amount is specific for each consumer based on the observed data. As you can see from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">15</ref>, when we fix the bills, the overdraft frequency for all overdrafters decreases, as does their balance-checking frequency and account closure frequency. All of these measures boost consumer surplus but reduce the bank's overdraft revenue. Total surplus rises because the gain to consumers outweighs the loss to the bank. From a public policy perspective, the government might enforce a policy to fix the bill arrival date and/or amount to help consumers with the overdraft problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Waiver</head><p>In practice, some banks waive overdraft fees when consumers complain about them. The welfare impact of this strategy is not clear. On one hand, the waived overdraft fee is a direct cost for the bank. But on the other hand, consumer attrition might be lower and the bank could earn more customer lifetime value. To understand this trade-off, we test two counterfactual scenarios: where the bank waives the overdraft fee once a year for consumers with high balances (balances above the median) and for all its consumers. When the waiver is offered to only the high-worth consumers, we find that retention and profitability both increase, as does consumer welfare. The latter is because the waiver reduces the monitoring costs of high-balance consumers, as they no longer have to check their balances very frequently. This increases high-net-worth consumers' utility in remaining with the bank; hence, retention and profitability rise. In contrast, when the bank grants the waiver to all consumers instead of only the high-balance ones, the bank's profit declines owing to lower overdraft revenue. Nevertheless, the social surplus is higher with the waiver than without it. Therefore, although the bank might have an incentive to implement the waiver for high balance customers, from a policy perspective, the government might also consider implementing the waiver for all consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Contributions and Limitations</head><p>The $32 billion in overdraft fees assessed by banks in 2012 has increased consumer attrition and drawn regulators' attention to this issue. However, there is little quantitative research on consumers' financial decisionmaking processes that explains their overdrafting behavior. The lack of well-calibrated models prevents financial institutions from designing appropriate pricing strategies and improving their financial products. With the aid of big data that capture consumers' spending patterns, banks can improve overdraft fees.</p><p>In this paper, we build a dynamic structural model of consumer daily spending that incorporates inattention to rationalize consumers' overdrafting behavior. We quantify the discount factor, monitoring cost, and dissatisfaction sensitivity for each consumer and use these variables to design new strategies. In comparing the current pricing scheme with several alternative pricing strategies, we find that a percentage fee structure can increase the studied bank's revenue through market expansion and that the quantity premium structure can increase the bank's revenue because of second-degree Liu, Montgomery, and Srinivasan: Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data price discrimination. New fee structures can also improve consumer welfare because of reduced monitoring costs.</p><p>We calibrated our model at an individual level on a sample of more than 500,000 accounts. The large sample is necessary because of overdraft being a rare event and the rich unobserved consumer heterogeneity. Besides, the sampling error can cause detrimental effect. To illustrate, we randomly select 10% of the sample and redo the analysis. The predicted revenue in the counterfactual of the quantity premium strategy is 6%, or $0.3 million less than the value obtained from results using the entire data set. In other words, the sampling error might lead to an incorrect strategy and a significant loss to the bank. Therefore, we argue that, given the sizable sampling error, if the computational burden of estimating a dynamic structural model on a large data set is minimal, as demonstrated by our parallel IJC algorithm, using the full data set is preferred.</p><p>To estimate a complicated structural model with big data, we adopt parallel computing techniques in combination with the Bayesian estimation algorithm developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Imai et al. (2009)</ref>. This new method significantly reduces the computation burden, and it could be used by other researchers and marketers who would like to use structural models to solve real-world large-scale problems. Although we apply it to the overdraft context, the model framework can be generalized to analyze other marketing problems in which consumers have similar dynamic budget allocation decisions (e.g., utility accounts and mobile phones).</p><p>Several limitations of the current study call for future work. First, we do not observe consumers' existing alert settings. Some consumers may have already received alerts to help them make financial decisions. This might cause an overestimation of the monitoring cost and an underestimation of the inattention sensitivity to lapsed time. But given the prevalence of overdrafts, we conjecture that many consumers are not using alerts. And because our counterfactual only alters the pricing strategies, we cannot think of any reason that our welfare analysis results can be different after accounting for alerts. Future studies might consider incorporating alert data or investigating counterfactual scenarios where alerts reduce monitoring costs. Second, we do not have data on consumers' decision to opt in for overdraft protection by ATM/POS transactions. We only know that if ATM/ POS transactions caused overdrafts, then the consumer must have opted in. However, if we do not observe ATM/POS-transaction-caused overdrafts, this does not mean that the consumer has opted out. Sometimes, an opt-in consumer can be cautious enough (low monitoring cost) to avoid overdrafts from using ATM/POS transactions. Had we known the opt-in status information, we could have provided an informative prior within our Bayesian model, as consumers who opt in probably have stronger needs for short-term liquidity owing to fluctuations in the size and arrival time of their income and spending. Moreover, it is possible that consumers might forgive the bank after a period of time. Future research could examine whether consumer dissatisfaction declines over time. Finally, we model only consumers' nonpreauthorized spending from their checking accounts with one bank. In reality, consumers usually have multiple accounts, such as savings, credit cards, 47 and loans, with multiple financial institutions. A model that captures consumers' decisions across all accounts for both short-term and long-term finances would provide a more complete picture of consumers' financial constraints, management capabilities, and resources so that the bank can design more customized products.  <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) Overdraft fee abuse.

The segment is defined by the number of overdraft occurrences in the sample period. 14 Another explanation of this phenomenon is that this consumer forgot the exact amount of balance. Our notion of inattention is consistent with forgetting <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mullainathan 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Mehta et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Ching and Ishihara 2010</ref>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> We also find that light overdrafters are more likely to check balances after overdraft fees are charged than heavy overdrafters. This also provides evidence for inattention. Furthermore, we find that light overdrafters fail to learn from past experiences. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between the time elapsed since overdraft and the time gap between two balance-checking times. This suggests that immediately after overdrafting, consumers might start monitoring their checking accounts. As time goes by, however, they become inattentive again. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We also test this assumption by estimating a myopic model and a bounded forward-looking model. The results can be found in Online Appendix A6. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Our focal bank practices "nightly batch processing," a process of posting transactions (credits and debits) to the account after the close of business each day, following the industry standard. However, the posting order is based on the exact transaction time (to an accuracy of each second). Preauthorized transactions, like income deposits (direct deposit) or bill payments, are always posted before nonpreauthorized transactions. Our model timing is consistent with this posting order. Moreover, our model assumes that balance checking happens before spending. In the scenario when the consumer spends before checking his or her balance (our data will show that the debit transaction occurs before balance checking), we assume that the consumer does not know the initial balance of that day. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Consumption C it must be nonnegative. When applied to the data, there are days when consumers just receive income (e.g., deposit money) without any consumption (spending). In this case, we set C it = 0 but update the budget equation with the "negative spending" discussed in Section 4.5. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We discuss how we differentiate bills and consumption in the data in the last paragraph of Section 4. <ref type="bibr">1. 20</ref> This assumption is realistic in our setting because we distinguish between inattentive and attentive consumers. The argument that a consumer might not be fully aware of the per-item fee is indirectly captured by the balance perception error (which we explain in the next subsection) in the sense that the uncertain overdraft fee is equivalent to the uncertain balance because both of these tighten the consumer's budget constraint. As for attentive consumers who overdraw because of heavy discounting, such consumers would be fully aware of the potential costs of overdrafting. Thus, in both cases, we argue that the assumption of a known total overdraft fee is reasonable. 21 Alternatively, we could describe this nonpreauthorized spending as immediate or discretionary spending. We avoid the term discretionary spending to avoid confusion with the usual economic definition. Economists traditionally use the term discretionary as the amount of income left after spending on necessities such as food, clothing, and housing, whereas in our problem, we are thinking about immediate spending that could have been delayed. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> We choose to assume that consumers are inattentive to balances instead of the overdraft fee for several reasons. First, the mean overdraft frequency is 10 times, and the median overdraft frequency is three times. This implies that most consumers have paid overdraft fees multiple times. According to the bank's policy, once a consumer overdraws, he or she will receive both an email and mail notification immediately, and the overdraft payment will be reflected in the account statement. During the sample period, the bank did not change its overdraft fee. Therefore, provided that a consumer overdrew once and paid the overdraft fee, he or she should be aware of the overdraft charge. Moreover, according to the Regulation E amendment, after 2009, consumers must be informed of the overdraft fee policy, including its amount, for the bank to obtain affirmative consent (opt in) for overdraft coverage from consumers. As our sample period falls after 2010, all consumers have been informed of the overdraft charge. Finally, the model-free evidence in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> suggests that balance-checking frequency significantly affects overdraft probability. Therefore, uncertainty regarding balances appears to be a major driver of overdrafts.</p><p>23 Consumers can also be naively inattentive, but we do not allow for this here. See the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Grubb (2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Conditional on her consumption choices today, C it , based on Equation (2), the consumer is still not perfectly informed about the budget constraint at the beginning of the next period, that is, B it+1 , because the preauthorized bills, ψ it+1 , is unknown. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The mean balance perception errorη cannot be separately identified from the variance parameters ρ because the identification sources both come from consumers' overdraft fee payments. Specifically, a high overdraft payment for a consumer can be explained by either a positive balance perception error or a large perception error variance caused by a large ρ. Thus, we fixη at zero; that is, the perception error is assumed to be unbiased. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> We considered other specifications for the relationship between the perception error variance and the time elapsed since the last balance check. The results remained qualitatively unchanged. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> We also tested whether the forced closure probability is associated with the overdraft transaction amount, but we failed to find a statistically significant relationship. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> When estimating this linear probability model, we set the lower bound and upper bound of π f at 0 and 1. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> We also consider two other models with dissatisfaction specified as the sum of past ratios Δ it ODit |Bit−Cit | and allow consumers to forget the ratios except the past three ones. However, both the log marginal density and the hit rate of these alternative models are worse than our proposed model. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Please find a discussion of the normalization in Online Appendix A7. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> The correlation between the overdraft fee and the overdraft amount is actually very small (0.02), so we assume that the overdraft fee is not an increasing function of the overdraft amount but i.i.d. over time. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> A compound Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of the sum of a number of independent identically distributed random variables, where the number of terms to be added is itself a Poissondistributed variable. In our model, each independent bill, for example, a mortgage loan interest or credit card payment, is a random variable. Because the total number of bills that arrive each day is Poisson-distributed, the sum of the bills becomes a compound Poisson distribution. We use G to characterize the discrete distribution of the size of each individual bill, and G is an empirical distribution. Suppose in the entire sample, that one consumer has three utility bills with amounts $30, $50, and $80 as well as one cell phone bill of the amount $30. Then, G is G(x) 0.5 ifx 30, 0.25 if x 50, 0.25 if x 80. The arrival rate parameter φ in the Poisson distribution is estimated using the maximum likelihood method. We estimate both G and φ from the data heterogeneously for each individual before estimating the structural model. They are used as inputs in the structural estimation. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> More explanations on our choice of the income and bill process can be found in Online Appendix A9. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> The transition process for the perceived balance B it is jointly determined by Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">2</ref>) and (4). <ref type="bibr">35</ref> For the sake of simplicity, we have omitted the subscript i.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

With more than three periods of data within a pay period, hyperbolic discount factors can be identified (Fang and Silverman  2009). However, our estimation results show that the present bias parameter is not significantly different from 1. Therefore, we keep only one discount factor in the current model.
