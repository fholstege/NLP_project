<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W e use data on all manufacturer funding and promotion activity by a major U.S. retailer during a two-year period to compute promotion pass-through and assess its magnitude.

Some key insights from our work are as follows. First, the retailer passes through more than 100% of the total manufacturer funding it receives in aggregate, but the median pass-through rate for individual manufacturers is much lower than 100%. Second, some manufacturers are promoted even without funding. This is more likely for private label and high-share manufacturers in high-lift and high-margin categories. Third, a small number of manufacturer and category characteristics explain a significant amount of the variation in pass-through. In particular, pass-through is higher for private label. It increases with the share of the manufacturer in the focal category but also with the sales of that manufacturer in other categories. Categories with high sales, high promotion lift, low concentration, and low margin get more pass-through.</p><p>We corroborate some recent conclusions in the literature, e.g., that some pass-through rates are much higher than 100% and that high-share manufacturers get more pass-through. We add several new insights, e.g., on the magnitude of aggregate pass-through, on cross-pass-through across and within categories, on pass-through for private label, and on the category drivers of pass-through.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As trade promotion spending in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry has steadily increased, manufacturers are rightly concerned about the proportion of this spending that is passed through to consumers by retailers. Research on promotion passthrough has been active since the 1970s, but most of it is analytical with only a few empirical analyses that use data that are 15-30 years old. Among the latter, the older studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armstrong 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Chevalier and Curhan 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Curhan and Kopp 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Walters 1989</ref>) examine a small number of specific trade deals offered to a retailer during a short period. The two recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Besanko et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, hereafter denoted BDG 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pauwels 2007</ref>) do not have data on trade promotions; they estimate pass-through from changes in weekly wholesale and retail prices.</p><p>In this paper, we compute pass-through using actual data on manufacturer trade promotion funding and retailer promotional spending. The data are extracted directly from the financial and sales database of a major U.S. retail chain and contain all trade promotion funds provided by each manufacturer in each category sold by the retailer, as well as all price promotion spending by the retailer for those manufacturers' products. This allows us to compute the retailer's aggregate pass-through, i.e., the percentage of total trade promotion funds that it spends on price promotions to consumers, as well as pass-through for each manufacturer in each category. We first describe the magnitude and variation of pass-through and then Marketing Science 28(4), pp. 782-791, © 2009 INFORMS 783 estimate a model to explain this variation across categories and manufacturers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Measure of Pass-Through</head><p>Promotion pass-through is defined as the percentage of trade promotion dollars that the retailer spends on retail promotions to consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Farris et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Neslin 2002</ref>. Operationally, researchers have either measured pass-through as the ratio of the retailer's discount to the manufacturer's discount for a specific trade deal (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Armstrong 1991, Chevalier and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Curhan 1976</ref>), or they have estimated it as the change in retail price stemming from a change in manufacturer price using time-series price data for a given product <ref type="bibr">(BDG 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Pauwels 2007</ref>). These approaches worked in the past when trade promotions were in the form of off-invoice or bill-back discounts for specific items sold in specific weeks. However, they have some important limitations given the current institutional reality of CPG trade promotions.</p><p>Off-invoice discounts have diminished as manufacturers have recognized that they encourage gray markets and forward buying. Cannondale <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Associates (1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Associates ( , 2000</ref> report that off-invoice deals decreased from 47% of the trade promotion budget in 1995 to 32% in 2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gomez et al. (2007)</ref> found in their 2002 survey that, on average, only 25% of trade promotions were off-invoice. Our experience with the retailer in this study also confirms that a large portion of manufacturer funding is now in the form of lump sum payments, market development funds, advertising allowances, etc. Some sort of allocation or accounting rule is needed to link these amounts to specific items and time periods. Similarly, if retailers forward buy promoted products, some inventory management and allocation rule is needed to determine their cost in periods when part or all of the quantity sold was bought on past trade deals (e.g., the average acquisition cost computation in BDG 2005). In the current context, therefore, it is difficult for manufacturer price or retailer acquisition cost of a specific product at a specific time to factually reflect trade promotion monies.</p><p>Given these issues, we measure pass-through by adding up the promotion funding, in all its forms, that the retailer receives from a manufacturer in a year and comparing it to the retailer's total spending on price promotions for the manufacturer's products. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides complete definitions and sources of data for these and all the other variables used in our empirical work. This measure accords with the basic definition of pass-through, is much less dependent on allocation rules, and accounts for not just promotional discounts, but also the amount sold on promotion, both of which determine promotion spending and should figure in the measurement of pass-through (van Heerde and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Neslin 2008)</ref>.</p><p>If funding is purely in the form of a fixed discount per promotional unit sold by the retailer, our measure coincides with the ratio of retail-to-manufacturer discount because both promotion spending and funding increase proportionally with the number of promotional units sold. However, when funding is not just per promotional unit sold, e.g., when part of it is in lump sum or other forms or even when there is forward buying, our measure diverges from previous measures and is more appropriate, as noted above. Other advantages of our measure are as follows. It is computed from actual funding and spending data and does not rely on model-based estimation. It focuses on promotions and separates them from regular prices, a distinction that is important in measuring pass-through <ref type="bibr">Gupta 2008, McAlister 2007)</ref>. It covers potential retailer forward buying. 1 It clearly identifies cases where the retailer promotes even without manufacturer funding and cases where the retailer does not promote despite receiving funding.</p><p>The limitations of the measure should also be noted. It precludes us from studying promotion frequency versus depth decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Kumar et al. 2001</ref>, pass-through timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Meza and Sudhir 2006)</ref>, or promotion timing within and across brands <ref type="bibr">(Lal 1990, Tellis and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zufryden 1995)</ref>. We also cannot examine temporally coordinated cross-brand passthrough (e.g., <ref type="bibr">BDG 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, McAlister 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Dubé and Gupta 2008</ref>. However, at an aggregate level, we can study whether pass-through for one manufacturer is influenced by funding received from other manufacturers. Finally, annual data aggregate across funding changes that manufacturers may make in response to retailer spending during the year. However, our measure is not affected by this potential endogeneity because it is computed, not estimated. Furthermore, our discussions with the retailer and two CPG manufacturers support annual analysis. According to them, the negotiation of trade promotion funding occurs largely at the beginning of the year, and midyear changes are impractical and infrequent.</p><p>In sum, therefore, our measure is right for its central purpose-assessing the magnitude and key determinants of pass-through. In the remainder of this paper, we (a) describe our data, (b) report the magnitude of pass-through, (c) examine the extent to which cross-sectional variation in pass-through is explained by key category and manufacturer characteristics, and (d) conclude with a summary of our findings and their implications.  The Magnitude of Pass-Through</p><p>We use actual sales and financial data from a major U.S. packaged goods retail chain. It sells over 200 categories of food, health, beauty, and general household products and is a high-low retailer; i.e., it offers price promotions on several products in each of its stores each week. Our data cover all manufacturer funding and price promotions by the retailer during 2003 and 2004. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to measure pass-through using complete information on a retailer's price promotion spending and funding. Therefore, it is useful to first provide a detailed description of the magnitude of pass-through in the data. We include in this analysis all manufacturers with annual sales greater than $10,000 across all the retailer's stores. Together, these manufacturers account for 99% of the retailer's total sales.</p><p>We begin with the ratio of total price promotion spending by the retailer during the year to total funding received from manufacturers that year. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> provides this aggregate pass-through for the retailer as a whole as well as for each of its four major product departments. To preserve confidentiality of the retailer's data, the departments are not identified by name, and only ratios, not dollar amounts, are listed in the table.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> highlights some important facts. First, aggregate pass-through is over 100% in both years. In other words, the retailer spends a little more on price promotions across all products than the total funding it receives from all manufacturers. Aggregate pass-through is higher in 2004 than in 2003, reflecting the retailer's increased promotion spending in the face of growing competition, particularly from mass  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">33 5  2 4 8  1 8 1  7 7 4  Department 2  619  18 9  2 6 4  1 6 1  6 4 7  Department 3  811  20 5  2 3 7  3 1 1  139 2  Department 4  603  15 5  1 4 4  2 6 9  197 1  Miscellaneous products #  50  11 6  1 0 8  7 8  7 6</ref>  48 12 2 1 1 9 7 5 7 6 4 * Aggregate pass-through is total promotion spending by retailer as a percentage of total promotion funding by manufacturers. # Includes products that do not belong in the four main departments.</p><p>retailers like Wal-Mart. Second, there is significant variation in this aggregate pass-through across the four major departments, with values ranging from 65% to 200%. Thus, although promotion spending is greater than funding in aggregate, manufacturers in some categories and departments get much lower pass-through than others. These large differences also suggest some cross-subsidization across categories and departments.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> provides additional insights into the nature of pass-through. The first column lists the number of observations for which pass-through is defined, i.e., where manufacturer funding is greater than zero.</p><p>The drop in the number of observations from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> underscores the importance of not only studying pass-through rates, but also examining the retailer's promotion spending for the 27% of manufacturers who provide no funding.</p><p>The second column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> reports median passthrough across all manufacturers who provide funding. The overall median pass-through rate is 20%, although it varies considerably across departments. This magnitude seems counterintuitive at first, given that aggregate pass-through is more than 100%. However, note that some manufacturers provide no funding and some receive no spending. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>, the two groups are not the same.</p><p>The median pass-through rate of 20% is across manufacturers who provide some funding to the retailer. However, 14%-15% of manufacturers receive some promotion spending even though they provide no funding. All spending by the retailer on these zerofunding manufacturers is left out of this distribution, although it does contribute to aggregate pass-through. On the other hand, 17%-25% of the manufacturers receive no promotion spending, although they provide some funding. They are included in the distribution and contribute to the low median pass-through.</p><p>If we only consider manufacturers who provide at least some (&gt;$100) funding and who also receive at least some spending (&gt;$100) from the retailer, the median pass-through increases to 75%, as shown in the last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>  Even in this group, the median is substantially lower than the retailer's aggregate pass-through. This is because low pass-through rates for several manufacturers are more than offset by very high pass-through for a few others, as can be seen from the complete distribution of pass-through rates in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For instance, in 2004, almost 28% of pass-through rates are greater than 100%, the 90th percentile is 400%, and the top 10% of pass-through rates account for only 2.7% of funding but 21% of retailer spending. Note that median pass-through rates also vary widely across the retailer's four main departments, ranging from 58% to 159% in 2004. Clearly, manufacturers care about the pass-through that they get for their own trade funds, not the retailer's aggregate pass-through. We now turn to the manufacturer and category characteristics that might explain this variation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determinants of Pass-Through Model Specification</head><p>We compile data on several manufacturer and category characteristics that may drive a retailer's passthrough decision. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">DDum3 c + mc (1)</formula><p>The subscripts in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) refer to manufacturer m in category c; complete definitions of all variables are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Previous researchers have examined only a small subset of these characteristics across a small number of categories, and as noted earlier, they use different pass-through measures. Therefore, our analysis is exploratory rather than a test of a priori hypotheses based on past work.</p><p>We first highlight the relevance of characteristics that have not been studied before. In Equation (1), Othr.Cat.Funds and Othr.Cat.Sales allow us to examine whether a manufacturer gets higher pass-through in one category because it provides more funds or has higher sales in other categories. Othr.Man.Funds lets us assess whether funding from other manufacturers within the category has any association with the passthrough that a given manufacturer gets. Ret.Cat.Lift allows us to test whether the retailer provides higher pass-through for categories that are more responsive to promotions. Ret.Cat.Margin and Ret.Rel.Margin let us determine whether pass-through is affected by the retailer's regular margin from a category or a particular manufacturer. Cat.Ret.Shr and Cat.Dist allow us to examine how the competitive intensity faced by the retailer in the category affects pass-through. Finally, dummy variables DDum1-DDum3 control for any department-specific effects not reflected by the other variables in our model.</p><p>We use a two-tiered model to account for the fact that our dependent variable is censored at zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wooldridge 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Greene 2003</ref>. Like the Tobit model, it corrects for censoring but it is more flexible than the Tobit model, because it removes the constraint of having a single mechanism for the choice between zero and nonzero pass-through and the amount of nonzero pass-through. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A probit model determines whether pass-through is zero or nonzero, and a lognormal regression model determines the magnitude of passthrough given that it is nonzero. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> To control for potential endogeneity of characteristics like manufacturer share and margin and category sales and margin, etc., we use their values in 2003 to explain variations in 2004 pass-through rates. There are 2,207 observations in the retailer's four major departments, with data in both 2003 and 2004. Of these, 1,709 have nonmissing data on our model variables. Because pass-through is only defined when funding is greater than zero, observations with zero funding automatically drop out of the analysis. We separately analyze these cases of zero funding later in this section. The remaining 1,507 observations are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Estimates</head><p>Probit Estimates for Zero Nonzero Pass-Through. The first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref> summarizes overall fit for the probit model. The likelihood ratio is highly statistically significant, rejecting the null hypothesis that all model coefficients except the constant term are zero. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">LR1 = −2 * LL − LL 0 2 = 1 − LL/LL 0 0 165 0 183 Aldrich-Nelson pseudo 0 149 0 203 R 2 = LR1/ LR1 + N * * * p &lt; 0 01.</formula><p>Measures of explanatory power, analogous to R 2 , are around 0.16. The first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref> provides estimated coefficients. It shows that the probability of nonzero pass-through increases with the share of the manufacturer in the focal category but also with the manufacturer's sales in other categories. Private label is more likely to get nonzero pass-through than manufacturer brands. The probability of nonzero pass-through is also higher in large and promotionsensitive categories. In contrast, it is lower in categories that are more concentrated and where the retailer has greater market share.</p><p>To provide a sense for the magnitude of these effects, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref> also shows elasticities for each variable and their standard errors. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The elasticities are computed off the "baseline" probability that the dependent variable equals one at mean values for continuous variables and zero values for dummy variables in the model. The elasticity for a continuous variable is the percentage change in baseline promotion probability when that variable is increased by 10% from its mean, and the elasticity for a dummy variable is the percent change when that dummy variable changes from zero to one. The baseline, i.e., the predicted probability that, conditional on providing funding, the average brand manufacturer in department 4 will be promoted, is 80%. This increases by 11.5% for private label. The elasticities of other significant variables are small, partly because the baseline probability is so high.   Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses. a Percent change in probability of nonzero pass-through from "baseline" when a continuous variable increases by 10% from its mean or a dummy variable changes from zero to one. "Baseline" probability is 80.3%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lognormal Regression</head><p>* p &lt; 0 10; * * p &lt; 0 05; * * * p &lt; 0 01.</p><p>explain 20.1% of the variation in (the logarithm of) nonzero pass-through rates. The third column of Table 6 provides coefficient estimates, most of which are significant. The standardized coefficients in the last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref> show their relative importance. Among manufacturer characteristics, we find that pass-through increases with market share, relative price, and sales in other categories. The former is consistent with <ref type="bibr">BDG (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pauwels (2007</ref><ref type="bibr">). However, contrary to BDG (2005</ref>, pass-through is significantly higher for private label than for manufacturer brands. Retailers may push private label with the expectation that it engenders store loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Steenkamp and</ref><ref type="bibr">Dekimpe 1997, Corstjens and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lal 2000)</ref>. Furthermore, retail margins on private labels are often substantially higher, so it is profitable for the retailer to switch consumers from the lower margin manufacturer brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ailawadi et al. 2006</ref>). Finally, pass-through is not strongly associated with funding from other manufacturers in the category; i.e., our data do not suggest the existence of cross-pass-through within a category.</p><p>Among category characteristics, categories with high sales and high promotion lift get higher passthrough. Large categories are more likely to build store traffic so it makes sense for them to get higher passthrough <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chevalier and Curhan 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Pauwels 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Walters 1989</ref>), and it is intuitively appealing that a retailer would pass-through more in categories where the return from promotions is higher. The opposite is true of categories where the retailer's market share position is strong-the retailer faces less competition and therefore less pressure to pass-through promotion funds in such categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bucklin 1987)</ref>. Finally, passthrough is lower in categories whose regular margins are high and that are more concentrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probit Model of Promotion Decision Without</head><p>Funding. As noted earlier, observations with zero funding are left out of the pass-through model. However, the retailer does promote products of some of these manufacturers, so it is important to understand the determinants of the retailer's promotion decision in the absence of funding. We therefore estimate a probit model of the retailer's binary decision of whether to promote for this subset of the data. The explanatory variables in the model are the same as in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). The last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref> summarizes the fit for this model and shows that our manufacturer and category characteristics do a reasonable job of explaining the retailer's decision to promote in the absence of funding, with measures of explanatory power around 0.20.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref> provides coefficient estimates and corresponding elasticities. It shows that four variables significantly affect the retailer's promotion decision for these manufacturers. High-share manufacturers and private label have a significantly higher probability of being promoted in the absence of funding, as do categories with high regular margins and high promotion lift. The baseline predicted probability of promotion without funding for brand manufacturers is 58%. It increases by 10.3%, 4.5%, and 2.7% with a 10% Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses. a Percent change in probability of nonzero spending from "baseline" when a continuous variable increases by 10% from its mean or a dummy variable changes from zero to one. "Baseline" probability is 58.2%.</p><p>* p &lt; 0 10; * * p &lt; 0 05; * * * p &lt; 0 01.</p><p>increase in the retailer's regular category margin, category promotion lift, and manufacturer share, respectively. It goes up by 33.6% for private labels.</p><p>Cross-Validation of Model Estimates. The purpose of our models is to describe how promotion pass-through varies with key category and manufacturer characteristics, not to make predictions. However, we conducted a cross-validation to assess the stability of our results by estimating each model on a calibration sample and using the calibration estimates to compute fit in a holdout sample. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Steckel and Vanhonacker (1993)</ref>, we used 80% of the observations for calibration and 20% for holdout. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> shows hit rates for the probit models and R 2 for the lognormal model in the calibration and holdout samples. As is to be expected, the fit is lower in the holdout sample because it is computed using estimates from the calibration sample. However, the degradation in fit is small for all three models, showing that the estimates are stable and can be used for description and inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to empirically examine all of the promotion passthrough by a retailer across all the funding received from manufacturers. It is also the first to examine the association of a variety of manufacturer and category characteristics with pass-through. Our measurement and analysis of pass-through using actual funding and spending data reveals some important insights. We summarize them below as stylized facts.</p><p>Aggregate Pass-Through Is Higher than Individual Pass-Through for the Average Manufacturer. The retailer's total promotion spending divided by total manufacturer funding is more than 100%. Some manufacturers get several times more spending than the funding they provide, and others are promoted even without providing funding. However, most manufacturers get much less than 100% pass-through <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blattberg et al. 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The Retailer Promotes Private Label, Promotion-Sensitive, and Profitable Categories Even Without Funding. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the retailer does not only promote manufacturers who provide trade promotion funds. Our findings suggest that the decision to promote unfunded products is influenced by affordability and incremental sales considerations. Private labels, which generally provide higher retail margins, and high-margin categories may allow the retailer to offer self-funded promotions while still maintaining reasonable margins, and self-funded promotions make more economic sense when returns on the promotions are higher.</p><p>Large Manufacturers Get Greater Pass-Through. Large-share manufacturers are more likely to be promoted even without funding, and they get higher pass-through of the funding they provide. We need a better understanding of why, because there are arguments on both sides. On one hand, high-share products have higher baseline sales, which can make promotions less profitable for retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McAlister 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Tellis and Zufryden 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, van Heerde and Neslin 2008</ref>. On the other hand, retailers may feel greater competitive pressure to promote these highly visible and high-lift products <ref type="bibr">(Ailawadi et al. 2006, Kim and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Staelin 1999)</ref>. We also need to understand whether the positive association with our pass-through measure Marketing Science 28(4), pp. 782-791, © 2009 INFORMS is because retailers promote high-share manufacturers more deeply or frequently than low share brands, or is simply because the lift from the same promotion depth and frequency is bigger for high-share brands.</p><p>Private Label Gets Greater Pass-Through. Analytical models have tended to conclude that private label should not be promoted <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sethuraman 2006</ref>), but retailers do promote private label. BDG ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>) report that private label receives lower pass-through than manufacturer brands in the Dominicks chain. In contrast, we find that private label is more likely to be promoted with as well as without funding, and it gets higher pass-through. Because the difference between private label and manufacturer brand retail margins varies significantly across retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ailawadi and Harlam 2004)</ref>, so might the profitability of private label promotions and therefore the retailer's pass-through. Also, pass-through for private label is only relevant when the retailer outsources it and receives some funding from the suppliers, not when it produces its own private label. Clearly, therefore, the issue of private label pass-through needs more research.</p><p>Cross-Pass-Through May Occur at an Aggregate Level. The fact that aggregate pass-through is more than 100% even though most individual pass-through rates are much lower suggests some cross-subsidization. Our analysis in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> suggests that this may occur across different categories and departments. The fact that private label is more likely to be promoted without funding than manufacturer brands suggests that brand manufacturer funding subsidizes private label promotions. However, pass-through for one manufacturer is not associated with funding from other manufacturers in the category. Thus, the evidence is consistent with cross-subsidies across departments and categories and from manufacturer brands to private label, but less so with cross-pass-through within a category.</p><p>As we noted earlier, we cannot test for temporally coordinated weekly cross-pass-through within a category <ref type="bibr">(BDG 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Moorthy 2005</ref>). However, our discussions with the retailer support the argument of McAlister ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>) that such complex promotion optimization is not practical, nor would it be well received by manufacturers. According to the retailer, trade promotion funds are viewed to some extent as a "pool of money." The retailer uses some of the funding received in categories where it has more leverage to promote private label. It also uses some of this funding to promote categories where it has less leverage but where competition is strong or promotions drive incremental sales. This is consistent with the patterns we observe in the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Although our results are based on analysis of a single retailer, we believe they are likely to apply to other high-low retailers. One reason is that our median passthrough rate for manufacturers who provide some funding and receive some promotion spending is close to the magnitude reported elsewhere. Another is that studies of other retailers have also found that a significant proportion of manufacturers gets pass-through rates much higher than 100% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armstrong 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">, BDG 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Walters 1989</ref>), suggesting that their aggregate pass-through may also be higher than the median rate for individual manufacturers. Still, we hope that other researchers will test the generalizeability of our results.</p><p>Ours is the first study of pass-through to span a wide range of product categories. We find large crosscategory differences, whereas much of the focus in prior work has been on manufacturer characteristics. Some of our findings require further study: First, categories with high regular margins are more likely to be promoted without funding, but when funding is provided they get lower pass-through. Second, passthrough is lower for concentrated categories. Third, category distribution is not strongly related to passthrough, which is surprising because it measures the competitive intensity faced by the retailer. We did not have data on manufacturer distribution, which varies more than category distribution and may be a stronger driver of pass-through <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Farris 2004)</ref>. Future research should study its effect.</p><p>Although we have identified several correlates of pass-through and cross-validation shows that the estimated effects are stable, a substantial amount of variation remains unexplained. Future research should consider how other category characteristics and other factors controllable by manufacturers such as different types of trade promotion or different performance clauses affect pass-through. Also, we have studied the retailer's pass-through in the form of price promotions. Nonprice support like displays, shelf talkers, extra shelf space, etc., is also very important to manufacturers. Future research should study the impact of manufacturer funding on nonprice support. As an aside, we note that aggregate pass-through is greater than 100% even without accounting for the retailer's spending on nonprice support. Including such expenditures would make this number higher.</p><p>We have computed pass-through and examined its cross-sectional variation. However, we have not addressed the question of how pass-through for a given manufacturer in a given category would change with changes in funding from that manufacturer or from other manufacturers in that category and other categories. At least for products that the retailer promotes without funding and those whose pass-through rates are extremely high, promotion spending may not change drastically even if funding changed. Conducting such analyses requires multiple years of data but is a fruitful direction for research.</p><p>Finally, we hope that researchers will incorporate the institutional details and insights from this work in their analytical and structural models of promotion spending and pass-through. This should help bridge the gap between theoretical development and empirical analysis that has developed because of the paucity of good data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Distribution of Individual Pass-Through Rates</figDesc></figure>
