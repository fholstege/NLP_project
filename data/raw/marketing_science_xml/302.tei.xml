<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Firms are filing for bankruptcy at a dramatic rate. Even for firms with more than $1 billion in assets, the number of bankruptcies has grown by a factor of five in the past three decades, and the book value of assets in bankruptcy has grown by a factor of 10, from $261 billion in the 1980s to $2.7 trillion in the 2000s. Bankruptcies of large firms can negatively affect stakeholders important to marketing, including customers, suppliers, partners, investors, creditors, and employees. A large body of research has investigated the financial factors that affect bankruptcy risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Altman 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Beaver 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Beaver et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Chava and Jarrow 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Ohlson 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, Sharma and Mahajan 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Shumway 2001</ref>. This research has found that a firm's profitability, leverage, liquidity, and size strongly affect the firm's bankruptcy risk.</p><p>In this article, we consider whether the assets built by advertising and R&amp;D also affect bankruptcy risk. Although no study has directly examined the impacts of these assets on bankruptcy risk, research has shown (and we replicate) that advertising assets and R&amp;D assets increase shareholder value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chan et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Joshi and Hanssens 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Osinga et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">, Rubera and Kirca 2012</ref>. Although these findings might imply that advertising assets and R&amp;D assets reduce bankruptcy risk in the same way they increase shareholder value, we argue otherwise and show that their impacts on bankruptcy risk are not merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value. The difference in how advertising assets and R&amp;D assets affect shareholder value versus bankruptcy risk hinges on the fact that shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period.</p><p>We argue, on the basis of extant literature, that advertising assets and R&amp;D assets affect expected cash flow from the next period and that market turbulence moderates these impacts. Therefore, because bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from the next period, we hypothesize that market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk.</p><p>Shareholder value is a function of an infinite number of periods, and thus shareholder value is more heavily weighted by expected cash flows from more distant future periods than expected cash flow from the next period. Because advertising assets and R&amp;D assets reflect a firm's strategy and are within a firm's control, they tend to be stable over time; expected advertising assets and R&amp;D assets in more distant 556 Marketing Science 34(4), pp. 555-572, © 2015 INFORMS future periods are closely related to current advertising assets and R&amp;D assets. Conversely, market turbulence is not stable over time. Rather than being controlled by the firm's own decisions, market turbulence is driven by unexpected changes in customer preferences. Therefore, the expected market turbulence in more distant future periods is not related to the current market turbulence, so current market turbulence does not moderate the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on shareholder value.</p><p>By investigating the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk, our study makes two key contributions. First, we show that advertising assets and R&amp;D assets are significant predictors of bankruptcy risk. Out-of-sample validation analyses indicate that bankruptcy prediction improves by considering advertising assets and R&amp;D assets in addition to the usual finance and accounting predictors. Second, we show that the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk are not merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value. Rather, because shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period, current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value. We hypothesize that market stability increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk, whereas market turbulence increases the impact of R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.</p><p>We organize the rest of the article as follows: We begin by developing our conceptual arguments and hypotheses for the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk and how they differ from the impacts of those same assets on shareholder value. Then, we define the measures we use for each of our variables, specify our models, explain the estimation techniques, and describe the data sets assembled. Next, we present and discuss the results of our analyses, validate the out-of-sample performance of the bankruptcy risk model, and assess the robustness of our results. Finally, we review the implications and limitations of our study and consider areas for further research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bankruptcy Risk and Shareholder Value</head><p>Both bankruptcy risk and shareholder value are functions of expected future cash flows. Bankruptcy risk, the risk that the firm will not generate enough cash to pay its financial and operating commitments, is the probability that expected cash flow from the next period will fully deplete the firm's liquidity <ref type="bibr">(Beaver 1966, D'Aveni and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ilinitch 1992)</ref>. The greater the expected cash flow from the next period, the lower the bankruptcy risk.

The greater the expected future cash flows, the greater the shareholder value. Because shareholder value is a function of an infinite number of periods, it is more heavily weighted by expected cash flows from more distant future periods than expected cash flow from the next period.</p><p>Because shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period, we argue that the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk are not merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value. In the next section, we discuss how advertising assets and R&amp;D assets affect expected cash flow from the next period and, consequently, bankruptcy risk. We then discuss how advertising assets and R&amp;D assets affect expected cash flows from more distant future periods and, consequently, shareholder value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Impacts of Advertising Assets and R&amp;D</head><p>Assets on Expected Cash Flow from the Next Period (i.e., Bankruptcy Risk) Marketing theory posits that past advertising and R&amp;D create intangible assets that affect expected future cash flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Srivastava et al. 1998)</ref>. Consistent with this, research has empirically shown that the cumulative effects of both advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sethuraman et al. 2011)</ref> and R&amp;D (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chan et al. 2001, Lev and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sougiannis 1996)</ref> from past periods affects cash flow. In this section, we consider how advertising assets (built through past advertising) and R&amp;D assets (built through past R&amp;D) affect expected cash flow from the next period and, consequently, bankruptcy risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Moderating Role of Market Turbulence.</head><p>Although both advertising and R&amp;D assets can affect expected cash flow, prior research suggests that the effectiveness of these assets is contingent on the characteristics of the market in which the firm is operating <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boyer 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Chan et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Chauvin and Hirschey 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Eberhart et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Hirschey and Weygandt 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Porter 1976</ref>. Research has shown that a firm's ability to deal with market turbulence has a significantly greater impact on its survival than its ability to deal with other market characteristics, such as market growth or market concentration. Thus, we consider the moderating role of market turbulence on the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on expected cash flow from the next period <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson and Tushman 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, D'Aveni and Ilinitch 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Hayward et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Market turbulence is characterized by instability, or uncertainty, in customer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson and Tushman 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Boyd 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Carpenter and Fredrickson 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Dess and Beard 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Gruca and Rego 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Jaworski and Kohli 1993</ref>. This instability in demand can be driven by factors such as macroeconomic conditions (e.g., regulation changes, financial crises) and market conditions (e.g., competitor actions) and results in a change in the mix of customers, current customers' preferences, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jaworski and Kohli 1993)</ref>. When the market becomes turbulent, previous advertising messages may become less relevant and firms may need to adapt their products and services to satisfy changing preferences. By contrast, when the market is stable, advertising messages retain more relevance and there is less need for a firm to adapt its products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jaworski and Kohli 1993)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">The Impact of Advertising Assets on</head><p>Expected Cash Flow from the Next Period (i.e., Bankruptcy Risk). Advertising builds intangible advertising assets that affect expected future cash flows. For example, advertising contributes to brand equity by increasing customers' awareness of and familiarity with the brand and by creating strong, favorable, and unique associations that reinforce the brand's point of difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Keller 1993)</ref>. The more relevant the point of difference embodied in the advertising asset is to the customer, the more likely the customer will consider and be persuaded to buy the firm's offerings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Celsi and Olson 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Greenwald and Leavitt 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, MacInnis and Jaworski 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Petty et al. 1983</ref>.</p><p>We posit that advertising assets are more effective at increasing expected cash flow when the market is stable because associations created through past advertising are more likely to continue to be relevant. By contrast, the more turbulent the market, the more customer preferences are unexpectedly changing and the more likely associations created through past advertising are inconsistent with these changed preferences. Consequently, we argue that advertising assets increase expected cash flow from the next period more when the market is stable than when the market becomes turbulent. Because bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from the next period, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 1A (H1A). Market stability increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">The Impact of R&amp;D Assets on Expected</head><p>Cash Flow from the Next Period (i.e., Bankruptcy Risk). R&amp;D builds intangible R&amp;D assets that affect expected future cash flows. For example, R&amp;D contributes to intellectual property, technical know-how, and patents that allow the firm to develop products and services that fit with customers' preferences. Research has shown that when a market becomes turbulent, R&amp;D assets provide a means for a firm to adapt to the unexpected changes in customers' preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ettlie 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Gupta et al. 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Han et al. 1998</ref>. Consistent with this, research has found that R&amp;D assets are more effective at generating cash flows when the market becomes turbulent than when the market is stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Russell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Russell 1992, Utterback 1971)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we posit that the impact of R&amp;D assets on expected cash flow is greater when the market becomes turbulent because those assets enable the firm to adapt to unexpected changes in customer preferences. By contrast, the more stable the market, the less the firm needs to adapt its products and services and the less R&amp;D assets affect expected cash flow. Consequently, we argue that R&amp;D assets increase expected cash flow from the next period more when the market becomes turbulent than when it is stable. Because bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from the next period, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 1B (H1B). Market turbulence increases the impact of R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The Impacts of Advertising Assets and R&amp;D</head><p>Assets on Expected Cash Flows from More Distant Future Periods (i.e., Shareholder Value) Shareholder value is a function of an infinite number of periods, and therefore shareholder value is more heavily weighted by expected cash flows from more distant future periods than expected cash flow from the next period. In the previous section, we argued that a firm's expected cash flow in a given period is a function of its advertising assets and R&amp;D assets and the market's turbulence in that period. Therefore, expected cash flow from a distant future period is a function of the expected advertising assets, expected R&amp;D assets, and expected market turbulence in that distant future period. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We argue that the firm's expected future advertising assets and R&amp;D assets are closely related to its current advertising assets and R&amp;D assets because these assets (1) are within a firm's control (i.e., the firm decides each period how much to invest in advertising and R&amp;D) and (2) reflect the firm's strategy and firm strategy tends to be stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fredrickson and Iaquinto 1989</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hannan and Freeman Marketing Science 34(4), pp. 555-572, © 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">INFORMS 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Mintzberg 1978</ref>. Because these assets decay each period <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Grabowski and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mueller 1978, Nerlove and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Arrow 1962)</ref>, their expected stability implies that the firm invests enough each period to maintain them. Consistent with this, prior research has argued that investors use the firm's current R&amp;D assets to forecast its expected future R&amp;D assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hall 1993)</ref>. This argument extends logically to suggest that investors use the firm's current advertising assets to forecast the firm's expected future advertising assets. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Finally, and also consistent with our argument that a firm's expected future advertising assets and R&amp;D assets are closely related to its current advertising assets and R&amp;D assets, in our data set we find a high correlation between current advertising assets and advertising assets 10 years in the future ( = 0 87) and between current R&amp;D assets and R&amp;D assets 10 years in the future ( = 0 87).</p><p>In contrast with the expected stability of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets, market turbulence is not stable over time. Rather than being controlled by the firm's own decisions, market turbulence is driven by unexpected changes in customer preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson and Tushman 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Boyd 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Carpenter and Fredrickson 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Dess and Beard 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Gruca and Rego 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Jaworski and Kohli 1993</ref>. We assume that market turbulence evolves similar to an autoregressive process because there is likely to be a carryover effect from the prior period (e.g., a highly turbulent market is likely to continue to have some degree of turbulence the following period) as well as a shock due to unexpected changes in customer preferences. Consequently, the expected value of market turbulence in distant future periods converges to a steady-state value that is not related to the current market turbulence. Consistent with this, in our data set we find a low correlation between current market turbulence and market turbulence 10 years in the future ( = 0 17).</p><p>Given that a firm's shareholder value is heavily weighted by its expected cash flows from distant future periods, we posit that the firm's shareholder value is affected by its expected advertising assets and R&amp;D assets and the market's expected turbulence in those distant future periods. Because the firm's expected distant future advertising assets are closely related to its current advertising assets, we expect to replicate previous findings that a firm's current advertising assets are positively associated with its shareholder value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barth et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bharadwaj et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> To our knowledge, this logic has not been explicitly stated in previous advertising research though it is consistent with theories and findings linking current advertising assets and shareholder value <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chan et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Joshi and Hanssens 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Osinga et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">, Rubera and Kirca 2012</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chan et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chauvin and Hirschey 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Conchar et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hirschey 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hirschey and Weygandt 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hanssens 2009, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Montgomery and Wernerfelt 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Osinga et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Rao et al. 2004)</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 2A (H2A).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Bankruptcy Risk Model</head><p>There is a rich history of approaches used in modeling bankruptcy risk. Altman (1968) uses multivariate discriminant analysis on matched pairs of 33 bankrupt and 33 nonbankrupt firms. The key limitation of this approach is the use of matched pairs, which resulted in a nonrandom sample that suffered from sample biases due to oversampling bankrupt firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Ohlson (1980)</ref> addresses this limitation by including all large industrial firms in the estimation of his bankruptcy logit model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Shumway (2001)</ref> further extends these approaches by using a hazard model to account for firm characteristics that change over time as well as the large number of censored observations in predicting bankruptcy risk. Recent bankruptcy risk models have adopted the <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Shumway (2001)</ref> approach of modeling bankruptcy risk with a hazard model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beaver et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Campbell et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Chava and Jarrow 2004</ref>. In marketing, <ref type="bibr">Helsen and Schmittlein (1993, p. 395</ref>) also note that when censored observations are prevalent, hazard models are "preferable to the regression, logit, and discriminant analyses that marketers have typically used." Furthermore, Van den Bulte and  show that omitting right-censored observations can bias results.</p><p>We therefore specify bankruptcy risk with a hazard function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h iy = Pr Y i = y Y i ≥ y x iy</formula><p>where Y i is the year firm i files for bankruptcy and the hazard function, h iy , is the probability that firm i with covariates x iy files for bankruptcy in year y, given that the firm has not filed for bankruptcy so far. Although the underlying hazard is continuous in that a firm can file for bankruptcy at any point in time, the covariates are only observed annually because of financial reporting standards. In cases such as this, that have an underlying continuous hazard with predictors observed at discrete intervals, research has shown that using a discrete-time hazard model with a complementary log-log link is most appropriate, yielding results that are more robust than those of the logit link <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Prentice and Gloeckler 1978)</ref>.

Using lagged data allows us to assess the impact of prior period predictors on bankruptcy risk in the current period. We choose a lag of two years to allow sufficient time between the reporting of financial data and the bankruptcy filing (e.g., if the firm files for bankruptcy at the beginning of the fiscal year, a lag of only one year could mean that financial variables were not yet reported). Furthermore, a lag of two years allows us to maximize the data available for analysis because many firms stop reporting financial information in the year prior to filing for bankruptcy. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Parametric assumptions about baseline hazards can produce inconsistent coefficient estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Meyer 1990</ref>), so we specify a nonparametric baseline hazard</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y = 0 + y y YEAR y i</formula><p>where 0 is an intercept term and YEAR y i are year dummy variables. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Campbell et al.

Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Iyengar et al. (2011)</ref> note that year dummy variables provide a nonparametric control for duration dependence.</p><p>3.4.1. Endogeneity. If a firm views advertising and R&amp;D as discretionary expenditures, it may cut back in these areas when it becomes financially distressed and reduce the size of its advertising assets and R&amp;D assets. To account for this source of potential endogeneity, we cannot use the standard approaches for linear models, such as two-stage least squares, because they would provide inconsistent results for our nonlinear model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrevaya et al. 2010)</ref>. Instead, to avoid the bias created by these potentially endogenous regressors, we adopt a "control function approach" (Albuquerque and Bronnenberg 2012, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Luan and Sudhir 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, Petrin and Train 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Rivers and Vuong 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">, Smith and Blundell 1986</ref>. The control function approach has two stages. In the first stage, we recover the estimated residuals from regressing each of the endogenous variables on all of the exogenous variables and instrumental variables. In the second stage, the estimated residuals from the first-stage regressions enter without transformation into the bankruptcy risk model in Equation (2) to "control" for the endogenous regressors.</p><p>We use historical market-average advertising intensity (advertising expenditures divided by the book value of assets), historical market-average R&amp;D intensity (R&amp;D expenditures divided by the book value of assets), and their interactions with market turbulence to obtain four instruments. We use the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion to determine the size of the window to use for the historical market averages. The information criteria point to a model with a three-year window for historical market-average advertising intensity and R&amp;D intensity.</p><p>These instruments are appropriate if historical market-average advertising and R&amp;D intensities reflect common norms of budgeting for advertising and R&amp;D (i.e., the instruments are relevant) but not common risks of bankruptcy (i.e., the instruments are exogenous). We see no reason (nor is there any published evidence) that after controlling for the predictors in our model, historical market-average advertising intensity and historical market-average R&amp;D intensity are related to an individual firm's bankruptcy risk two years later. Therefore, we posit that the instruments are exogenous. To test the relevance of the instruments, we compute the correlations of the instruments with the associated endogenous regressors. We find that they are strongly correlated (all correlation coefficients &gt; 0 60, p &lt; 0 001). We also find that coefficient estimates for the associated instruments in each of the first-stage regressions are significant (p &lt; 0 001), indicating that the instruments are relevant.</p><p>3.4.2. Tests of Hypotheses. The coefficient for ADV iy × TURB j i y , 1 , is our coefficient of interest to test Hypothesis H1A that market stability (i.e., smaller TURB j i y ) increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk. Therefore, a positive and significantˆ 1 would support Hypothesis H1A. The coefficient for RND iy ×TURB j i y , 2 , is our coefficient of interest to test Hypothesis H1B. A negative and signif-icantˆ 2 would support Hypothesis H1B that market turbulence (i.e., larger TURB j i y ) increases the impact of R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.</p></div>

The results for bankruptcy risk, presented in the first column of Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, indicate that a 1% higher level of advertising assets is associated with bankruptcy risk that is 0.22% lower when the market is stable and 0.04% lower when the market becomes turbulent, consistent with our hypothesis that market stability increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk. A 1% higher level of R&amp;D assets is associated with a 0.04% higher bankruptcy risk when the market is stable, suggesting that R&amp;D assets are not effective at reducing bankruptcy risk when the market is stable. Conversely, the same higher level of R&amp;D assets is associated with a 0.44% lower bankruptcy risk when the market becomes turbulent,  Notes. Impacts are calculated as the median predicted difference for a 1% higher level for each variable. Stable markets are those below and turbulent markets are those above the median market turbulence.</p><p>consistent with our hypothesis that market turbulence increases the impact of R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk. For comparison, we note that a 1% higher profitability is associated with a 0.91% lower bankruptcy risk, a 1% higher leverage is associated with a 0.45% higher bankruptcy risk, a 1% higher liquidity is associated with a 0.72% lower bankruptcy risk, and a 1% higher size is associated with a 0.09% lower bankruptcy risk.</p><p>The results for shareholder value, presented in the second column of Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, indicate that a 1% higher level of advertising assets is associated with a 0.05% higher shareholder value and a 1% higher level of R&amp;D assets is associated with a 0.36% higher shareholder value. For comparison, we note that a 1% higher profitability is associated with a 0.21% higher shareholder value, a 1% higher leverage is associated with a 0.05% higher shareholder value, a 1% higher liquidity is associated with a 0.02% higher shareholder value, and a 1% higher size is not associated with a substantial change in shareholder value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Out-of-Sample Validation of the Bankruptcy Risk Model</head><p>Although several studies model the impacts of advertising and R&amp;D on shareholder value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bharadwaj et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Chan et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Chauvin and Hirschey 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Hirschey 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Hirschey and Weygandt 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Montgomery and Wernerfelt 1988</ref>, to our knowledge our study is the first to model the impacts of advertising and R&amp;D on bankruptcy risk. Therefore, we validate the out-of-sample performance of the bankruptcy risk model. Because the data set we used for estimating the bankruptcy risk model ends in December 2006, we validate the model using new data from January 2007 to July 2012. This validation data set has 3,402 observations and 17 bankruptcies. We compute the predicted hazard of filing for bankruptcy for each observation in the validation data set using the coefficient estimates from the first column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. Following the approach used to assess out-of-sample performance in prior bankruptcy studies, we sort the observations in the validation data set by predicted bankruptcy hazard each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beaver et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Chava and Jarrow 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Shumway 2001</ref>. We then calculate the percentage of actual bankruptcies above and below the median predicted bankruptcy hazard each year. A perfect model would have 100% of the actual bankruptcies above the median predicted bankruptcy hazard. If our model had no predictive power, the expected fraction of actual bankruptcies above the median predicted bankruptcy hazard would be 50%, the same as the model-free approach. Panel A of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports the out-of-sample performance. The performance of the bankruptcy risk model (column II) is substantially better than the model-free approach (column I), with 94.12% of the actual bankruptcies above the median predicted bankruptcy hazard and only 5.88% of the actual bankruptcies below the median predicted bankruptcy hazard.</p><p>An alternative approach to assessing out-of-sample performance is to calculate the ratio of the median predicted hazard for actual bankrupt observations to the median predicted hazard for actual nonbankrupt observations. The larger the ratio, the better the performance. If our model had no predictive power, the predicted hazards for the two groups would be the same, and the ratio would be 1, the same as the model-free approach. Panel B of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports the ratios of the median predicted hazards. We find that the bankruptcy risk model substantially outperforms the model-free approach, with a ratio of 14.45.</p><p>We also considered the performance of a model that does not include marketing variables but is otherwise identical to the bankruptcy risk model (column III in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). For this model, 88.24% of the actual bankruptcies were above the median predicted bankruptcy hazard (versus 94.12% for the bankruptcy risk model), and the ratio of the median predicted hazard for actual bankrupt observations to the median predicted hazard for actual nonbankrupt observations was 4.87 (versus 14.45 for the bankruptcy risk model). These results suggest that considering marketing variables such as advertising assets and R&amp;D assets can substantially improve the ability to predict bankruptcy risk.</p><p>Finally, we consider the performance of a model that includes the marketing variables but does not include their interactions with market turbulence (column IV in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). For this model, 88.24% of the actual bankruptcies were above the median predicted bankruptcy hazard (versus 94.12% for the bankruptcy risk model), and the ratio of the median predicted hazard for actual bankrupt observations Marketing Science 34(4), pp. 555-572, © 2015 INFORMS to the median predicted hazard for actual nonbankrupt observations was 7.41 (versus 14.45 for the bankruptcy risk model). These results suggest that considering the moderating impact of market turbulence on the marketing variables can substantially improve the ability to predict bankruptcy risk.</p></div>

Advertising Assets and R&amp;D Assets Measures We measure advertising assets and R&amp;D assets using Koyck-type distributed lag functions with decay parameters of 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. As noted previously, we also ran our analyses with decay parameters in the range of 0.4 to 0.85 and found that results are robust to these changes. As an additional robustness check, we also considered distributed lag functions that do not assume a Koyck-type decay by measuring advertising assets and R&amp;D assets using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Erickson and Jacobson (1992)</ref> distributed lag weights of 0.7 and 0.3 for advertising lags of two and three years and 0.25, 0.21, 0.18, 0.14, 0.11, 0.07, and 0.04 for R&amp;D lags of two to eight years.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Advertising and R&amp;D Moderated by Other Market Factors</head><p>We hypothesized that market turbulence would moderate the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk. Our hypotheses are consistent with research that shows that a firm's ability to deal with market turbulence has a significantly greater impact on its survival prospects than a firm's ability to deal with other market characteristics, such as market growth or market concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson and Tushman 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, D'Aveni and Ilinitch 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Hayward et al. 2006</ref>). However, to ensure we have not overlooked other market characteristics that might also moderate the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk, we test whether market concentration and market growth moderate the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk.</p><p>Column II of Table <ref type="table">5</ref> reports the estimates for an alternative bankruptcy risk model with the interaction terms ADV × TURB and RND × TURB replaced with ADV × CONC and RND × CONC, and column III presents the estimates for an alternative bankruptcy hazard model with the interaction terms replaced with ADV × GROW and RND × GROW. We find that none of the coefficients for any of the alternative market characteristics interactions are significant. These results suggest that although the turbulence of the market moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk, neither the concentration of firms in the market nor the growth of the market significantly moderate the impacts of advertising assets or R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Alternative Controls for</head><p>Macroeconomic Factors To control for macroeconomic events, we follow precedence from the bankruptcy risk literature and include year dummy variables in the bankruptcy risk model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Campbell et al. 2008)</ref>. We conduct an additional robustness analysis by adding controls for financial market events and business cycle events to the bankruptcy risk model. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Because the year dummy variables were part of the baseline hazard function, and because we need to drop them in this robustness analysis because of multicollinearity with the alternative macroeconomic control variables, we use a Cox proportional hazards model (which allows for an unspecified baseline hazard) for this analysis. We use SPGROW y (growth in the S&amp;P 500 index) and SPTURB y (turbulence in the S&amp;P 500 index) as controls for financial market events and RECESSION y (a dummy variable set to 1 in recession years and 0 otherwise) as the control for business cycle events.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Additional Controls for Firm Factors</head><p>We also checked the robustness of our results to adding additional firm control variables to our models. We estimated an alternative bankruptcy risk model with the number of business segments and the number of <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We thank the editor for this suggestion.</p><p>patents included as additional control variables. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We draw segments data from the Compustat Segments database and set the segments variable SEGS iy equal to the number of segments for firm i in year y.

We set the variable PATS iy to the number of patents granted divided by the book value of assets for firm i in year y. The results of this robustness analysis, presented in column V of Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, are consistent with the estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, though the model does not fit the data as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Broader Measure of Failure</head><p>We also assess the robustness of our findings by considering a broader measure of failure. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We adopt the <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Campbell et al. (2008)</ref> failure measure, which includes bankruptcy filings, financially driven stock delistings, and D ("default") credit ratings. This broader failure measure enables us to capture cases in which the firm defaults on its credit commitments and cases in which the firm performs so poorly that it is delisted from the stock exchange-events that sometimes precede bankruptcy. Recall that, consistent with other studies, less than 1% of observations have a bankruptcy filing in our data set. An additional benefit of the broader failure measure is that it captures 58% more failures than when using only bankruptcy filings. The estimation results using the broader failure measure, presented in column VI of Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, are consistent with the bankruptcy risk model estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Alternative Shareholder Value Measure</head><p>We also assess the robustness of our findings by measuring shareholder value as market-to-book instead of Tobin's q.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7.">Additional Robustness Analyses</head><p>We conducted several additional analyses to assess the robustness of our results. We checked the robustness of our results to using predictors from one year prior and three years prior instead of predictors from two years prior. We also analyzed the robustness of our results to alternative measures of the financial control variables and market control variables. We then checked the robustness of our results to alternative Marketing Science 34(4), pp. 555-572, © 2015 INFORMS instruments and also checked for the presence of interaction effects between advertising assets and R&amp;D assets. We provide the results of these analyses in the Web Appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0913).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Our study provides new insights into whether and how assets built by advertising and R&amp;D reduce bankruptcy risk. We find robust empirical support for our hypotheses that the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk are not merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value. The results show that the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk are moderated by market turbulence, whereas their impacts on shareholder value are not moderated by market turbulence. Market stability increases the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk, whereas market turbulence increases the impact of R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Implications</head><p>Insight into the impact of marketing on bankruptcy risk has become increasingly important because of the dramatic rate at which firms are filing for bankruptcy. These bankruptcies are costly to firms because they create both direct (e.g., legal, accounting, and other administrative costs) as well as indirect (e.g., opportunity costs of management distraction, customer concerns with long-term support) costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Altman 1984)</ref>. Our findings have implications for top management teams, supplier marketing managers, financial institution marketing managers, investors, and theory. 7.1.1. Top Management Teams. Across many years with varying levels of market turbulence, top management teams likely realize that marketing assets build shareholder value. However, although they might expect these marketing assets to reduce bankruptcy risk in the same way they build shareholder value, our results suggest that this is not likely the case. Understanding this is particularly important for top management teams because bankruptcies have become more prevalent in recent years.</p><p>Top management teams should realize that when the market is stable, advertising assets more effectively insulate the firm from bankruptcy. When the market becomes turbulent, R&amp;D assets more effectively insulate the firm from bankruptcy. Our results indicate that when a firm's marketing assets are not well matched to the market turbulence it is experiencing, the top management team should employ other resources to bolster the firm's financial position.</p><p>7.1.2. Supplier Marketing Managers. This research also has important implications for a supplier's marketing managers. To the extent that the firm sells through intermediaries, marketing managers must monitor and react to both the growth prospects and the financial stability of intermediate customers.</p><p>If a distressed intermediary is a particularly important customer, the manager can adjust the terms of trade credit to help ease the customer's financial distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Molina and Preve 2012)</ref>. Because the customer's bankruptcy risk clearly plays into that trade credit decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Loten and Lublin 2014)</ref>, the marketing manager needs to understand that the customer's advertising assets will better protect the customer from bankruptcy when the market is stable whereas the customer's R&amp;D assets will better protect the customer from bankruptcy when the market becomes turbulent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.3.">Financial Institution Marketing Managers.</head><p>Similar to suppliers, financial institutions have a vested interest in assessing the risk that their customers will file for bankruptcy. Unsecured lenders in particular are often at significant risk of not receiving payment if customers file for bankruptcy. Evaluating how well the customers' marketing assets are aligned with market turbulence should help marketing managers in financial institutions better assess that risk.</p><p>7.1.4. Investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warns investors that shares in bankrupt companies can become worthless because "In most instances, the company's plan of reorganization will cancel the existing equity shares. This happens in bankruptcy cases because secured and unsecured creditors are paid from the company's assets before common stockholders." <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The results indicate that when assessing the risk of their holdings, investors should account for the firm's marketing assets and how well they are aligned with the turbulence of the market in which the firm operates. 7.1.5. Theory. Our findings also have important theoretical implications. It is not the case that marketing's impact on bankruptcy risk is merely the inverse of its impact on shareholder value. The differences hinge on the fact that shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period. We show that current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on expected cash flow from the next period but not on expected cash flows from more distant future periods. Therefore, market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Limitations and Areas for Future Research</head><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the ways that marketing might insulate a firm from bankruptcy risk. Given that bankruptcies are increasing, further investigation of the link between marketing and bankruptcy risk is warranted. Our study considers the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on reducing bankruptcy risk. Future research should consider the impacts of more disaggregated assets, distinguishing between the types of advertising used and the types of R&amp;D pursued in creating the assets. For example, advertising assets could be separated by media type or by whether the advertising used to create the asset was price oriented or differentiation focused. R&amp;D assets could be separated by those built through radical versus incremental R&amp;D or process versus product R&amp;D. Future research should also consider more aggregated marketing assets (e.g., brand equity) that are built through a combination of marketing activities such as advertising and R&amp;D. Our study uses annually reported financial data. A limitation of our data is that it does not allow for the study of a firm's short-term tactical actions. It may be that some firms take short-term actions, such as temporary price reductions and sales promotions, to increase sales when they become financially distressed. Such actions may not be captured in annual financial reports. As new data sources become available, as well as new proxies based on publicly reported data, future research should consider the implications of short-term marketing actions on bankruptcy risk and explore how they may differ from their impacts on shareholder value.</p><p>We estimated our models using data from large publicly traded firms in the United States. However, the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk might differ in other countries or for smaller or private firms. Future research should address these questions.</p></div>

First, we show that advertising assets and R&amp;D assets significantly affect bankruptcy risk.

Second, we show that the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk are not merely the inverse of their impacts on shareholder value. Because shareholder value is a function of expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is a function of expected cash flow from only the next period, current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&amp;D assets on bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">We assume that expected future advertising assets and R&amp;D assets are independent of expected future market turbulence. To assess the validity of this assumption, we computed correlation coefficients between advertising assets and market turbulence, and R&amp;D assets and market turbulence, for each firm-year observation in our data set. We found that the correlations are very small. The median correlation between ADV and TURB is 0.00 and between RND and TURB is 0.05. Note that the variables ADV, RND, and TURB are measured as defined in §3.2.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">As part of our robustness analyses, we also consider lags of one year and three years.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">We did not consider the fixed-effects estimator for the bankruptcy risk model because the complementary log-log fixed-effects estimator suffers from the incidental parameters problem, which leads to biased estimates (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wooldridge 2002)</ref>.7  We use predictors lagged by two years to be consistent with the bankruptcy risk model. As part of our robustness analyses, we also consider lags of one year and three years.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">We use a random-effects estimator for consistency with the bankruptcy risk model. We also considered a fixed-effects estimator and found that the coefficient estimates from the fixed-effects estimator were directionally consistent with the estimates from the random-effects estimator.</note>
