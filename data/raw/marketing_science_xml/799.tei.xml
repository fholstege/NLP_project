<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>}</head><p>C onsumers often have to evaluate products comprising a combination of attributes that is not expected by them, given their beliefs about how attributes normally co-vary in the product category. Such an attribute combination implies that the claimed level of a product attribute is then different from what the consumer might infer, given the level of another attribute, resulting in what we call product incoherence. We develop a model to calibrate the effect of incoherence on perceptions, uncertainty, preference, and ultimately purchase. Our model can allow managers to determine consumers' acceptance for different positions in the multiattribute space, so they can optimize their product's positioning. Our model implies that a product that combines positively valued attributes might increase some elements of preference for the product, but if those attributes occur in unexpected combinations, incoherence will also increase uncertainty which in turn might lower other elements of preference. The net risk-adjusted preference for a product in our model accommodates both the benefit from the expected attribute levels and the uncertainty associated with incoherence. We derive implications from the model and provide an empirical test that supports those implications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We examine the situation in which a consumer receives information about two attributes whose levels are expected to be correlated, but where the claimed level of one attribute is far from what the consumer would expect given the claimed level of the other. Consider the 2005 Honda Accord hybrid, which claims to be a "surprisingly fuel efficient 255 horsepower" car <ref type="bibr">(Newsweek 2004)</ref>. A car with high fuel efficiency and power is called surprising because the commonly observed negative correlation between these attributes makes this new combination unexpected. Specifically, the consumer must reconcile the car's claim of high fuel efficiency with an inference of low fuel efficiency, based on the belief of negative correlation between fuel efficiency and power (and conversely) We call this phenomenon product incoherence, where unlikely attribute combinations provide the consumer with discrepant attribute information about product performance. Our goal in this paper is to develop a methodology to calibrate the effect of incoherence and its antecedents on preference, allow-ing managers to make better decisions about how to optimize product positioning in practice.</p><p>While incoherence has been studied in the behavioral science literature in various forms-concept incoherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Murphy and Medin 1985)</ref>, schema incongruity (Meyers-Levy and Tybout 1989), and category incoherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rehder and Hastie 2004)</ref>-that literature has not produced a quantitative model of the effect of product incoherence or its antecedents on consumer preference. In the absence of such a model, it is difficult to calibrate the effect of unexpected attribute combinations on preference. For example, if powerful cars are thought to be fuel guzzlers, safe cars are believed to be boring, and cola sodas are known to be brown, then to what extent will the market accept a "powerful and fuel efficient" car (2005 Honda Accord hybrid), a "safe and stylish" car (Volvo V70, see http://volvocars-pr.com), or "a blue-colored cola" (Pepsi Blue, see http://www. spudart.org/pepsiblue/)? Our model can provide a manager with information about the effects of different positions in multiattribute space on market acceptance. As a result, such a model can inform several <ref type="bibr">Kayande, Roberts, Lilien, and Fong:</ref> Mapping the Bounds of Incoherence Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 504-513, © 2007 INFORMS 505 important marketing problems, including (1) improving product design and selection of optimal attribute combinations, (2) choosing a credible position for a new product launch into an existing market structure, and (3) developing effective communication strategies that emphasize coherent attributes.</p><p>Our model integrates a utility-maximizing consumer's (i) beliefs of interattribute covariation, (ii) attribute perceptions, (iii) uncertainty about those perceptions, and (iv) risk aversion, leading to an expression for the risk-adjusted preference for the product. Our main result shows that while combining positively valued attributes may increase expected preference for the product even if those attributes occur in unexpected combinations, incoherence will increase uncertainty about the product's attributes because of the conflict with the consumer's interattribute covariation beliefs. If the utility loss due to increased uncertainty (adjusted by the consumer's risk aversion) is greater than the expected benefits offered, the consumer's net preference for a product suffers. Our model provides managers with the capability to understand the risks associated with unique and unexpected attribute combinations that might be offered in pursuit of differentiation.</p><p>There are many cases that result in incoherence besides those involving unlikely attribute combinations (e.g., high fuel efficiency and power).   <ref type="bibr">Crossan and Kachra 2002)</ref>. In this paper, we model only the effect of the incoherence that arises from unlikely attribute combinations, and we address possible model extensions in the final section.</p><p>In the next section, we present our model and derive predictions of when and how incoherence affects preference. We then describe an empirical test of the model's predictions, which supports our model structure. We conclude with an assessment of the implications (and limitations) of our work, as well as an agenda for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model of the Effect of Incoherence on Preference</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we present our model's conceptual basis, which is drawn from the behavioral science literature. Our model assumes that consumers use their perceived interattribute correlations in a category to infer the level of one attribute given the performance level claimed by the firm on the other attributes. This inferencing presents the consumer with two pieces of information about the attribute performance level: the product's claim and their own inference. We propose that the consumer forms perceptions of the attributes by putting together these two pieces, ultimately integrating these uncertain perceptions into a risk-adjusted preference. In this section, we present the formal model along with a justification for our assumptions.</p><p>We discuss our model in terms of two attributes and symmetric effects of attributes on each other. While our model is individual and product specific, we suppress those subscripts for simplicity. We denote the consumer's (i) perceptions of products in the category on attributes 1 and 2, respectively, as x 1 and x 2 , (ii) inferences of performance of the focal product as X 1I and X 2I , and (iii) perceptions of the focal product as X 1 and X 2 . We denote the focal product's claims of performance by X 1C and X 2C . Uncertainty is denoted with the same subscripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Prior Information About the Product Category</head><p>We assume that the consumer has beliefs about (i) typical attribute levels in the category and (ii) interattribute covariation in the category. Our main interest here lies in covariation beliefs. These beliefs are formed by consumers on the basis of empirical observation and/or subjective conceptual theories and are known to be difficult to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pechmann and Ratneshwar 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Broniarzcyk and Alba 1994a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Fugelsang and Thompson 2003</ref>.</p><p>We represent the consumer's belief of how the level of attribute 1 in the product category is affected by the level of attribute 2, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 2 = 1 + 12 • x 2 + 12 (1)</formula><p>where x 1 2 is the perceived level of performance on attribute 1 given the level of attribute 2, 1 is the intercept, 12 is the partial regression coefficient, and 12 is an error term indicating that the attributes are not perfectly correlated. The consumer's interattribute covariation belief is represented by 12 , the partial regression coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Belsley et al. 1980)</ref>. 1 represents information about attribute 1 that does not come from the level of attribute 2. We assume that the consumer knows 12 , that 12 follows a normal distribution N 0 2 12 , and that 1 is ∼N 1 2 1 . We assume an analogous model for x 2 1 , the consumer's belief of the level of attribute 2, given the level of attribute 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Product Claims About Attribute Performance</head><p>We assume that a firm makes claims of product performance on the two attributes and that the consumer has some uncertainty about these claims, denoted by 2 1C and 2 2C . We further assume that the consumers' distribution of beliefs about the claim on each attribute is normal with mean X 1C and X 2C , respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Inference Formation</head><p>Consumers use their interattribute covariation beliefs to make inferences (see <ref type="bibr">Dick et al. 1990, Broniarzcyk and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alba 1994b)</ref>. We therefore assume that the consumer accesses beliefs about covariation, as described in §2.1, to infer the information that each attribute provides about the other. Using Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and the fact that E 12 = 0, we assume that the consumer takes the maximum likelihood value of inferences about the mean level of X 1 , embodied in the level of X 2C . Thus, X 1I , given X 2C , is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X 1I = 1 + 12 • X 2C (2)</formula><p>Because 1 represents the consumer's information about attribute 1 that does not come from the level of attribute 2, we assume that 12 • X 2C and 1 are independent. The variance of X 1I is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">2 1I = 2 1 + 2 12 + 2 12 • 2 2C (3)</formula><p>We can derive analogous expressions for the mean and variance of the distribution of X 2I . The assumption of normality for the distributions of 1 , 2 , X 1C and X 2C implies that the distributions of X 1I and X 2I are also normal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Perception Formation</head><p>To form a perception of attribute 1 (X 1 ), the consumer must reconcile information about the performance of the product on attribute 1 that comes from the distribution of the claim, denoted by 1C x , and the distribution of the inference, denoted by 1I x . We now assume that the consumer uses X 1C with probability p 1 and X 1I with probability (1 − p 1 ). Given this assumption, the resulting distribution of perceptions 1 x is a mixture of the distribution of claims and inferences (see Appendix A.1 for the proof), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 x = p 1 • 1C x + 1 − p 1 • 1I x (4)</formula><p>where 0 ≤ p 1 ≤ 1. The expected value and variance of X 1 are</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E X 1 = X 1 = p 1 • X 1C + 1 − p 1 • X 1I and (5) var X 1 = 2 1 = p 1 • 1 − p 1 • X 1C − X 1I 2 + p 1 • 2 1C + 1 − p 1 • 2 1I (6)</formula><p>We now seek weights p 1 and 1 − p 1 that make the expected value of X 1 tend toward "accept the claim" as the variance of the inference ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>1I ) becomes relatively large, and "accept the inference" as the variance of the claim ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>1C ) increases. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al. (1975)</ref>, we propose the following US/(US + THEM) weighting:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p 1 = 2 1I / 2 1C + 2 1I (7)</formula><p>where is a parameter to be estimated, reflecting the consumer's uncertainty intolerance (i.e., the greater is, the more weight the consumer places on a more certain estimate). This specification of p 1 is somewhat more general than that used in Bayesian updating.</p><p>For simplicity and tractability, we specify p 1 as proportional to the square of precision (i.e., = 2). Analogous expressions to Equations ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can be obtained for attribute 2 by symmetry. Equations ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) have some appealing properties. In Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), the consumer's mean perception is a weighted sum of the means of the distribution of the two components (the claim and the inference) with the weights dependent on the variances, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gatignon's (1984)</ref> advertising information model. The variance in the consumer's perception of attribute 1, 2 1 , increases with the distance between the means of the distributions of the claim and the inference, consistent with behavioral findings that discrepant information increases uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Einhorn and Hogarth 1985)</ref>. Because X 1C − X 1I 2 increases as the attribute combination deviates from what is expected, we formally define attribute incoherence AI 1 as AI</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 = X 1C − X 1I 2 (8)</formula><p>Attribute incoherence for attribute 2 follows by analogy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Preference Formation</head><p>We now model how the consumer translates uncertain perceptions (Equations 5 and 6) into preference. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Keeney and Raiffa (1976)</ref>, we assume a constantly risk-averse consumer whose utility function is negative exponential. While this specification has previously been used to derive expected utility for a single variable (see <ref type="bibr">Urban 1988, Chatterjee et al. 1988)</ref>, the consumer has information on two correlated variables in our case. Assuming that the joint distribution of X 1 and X 2 can be approximated with a bivariate normal density function, the consumer's risk adjusted preference Z for the product is as follows (see Appendix A.2 for derivation):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Z = w 1 • X 1 + w 2 • X 2 − r/2 • w 2 1 • 2 1 + w 2 2 • 2 2 + 2w 1 w 2 12 = v − r/2 • 2 v (9)</formula><p>where Z is monotonically related to expected utility, w 1 and w 2 are relative importance weights of attributes 1 and 2, r is the risk-aversion parameter, and 12 is the covariance between X 1 and X 2 . For simplicity, we hereafter call V "mean preference" and 2 V "preference uncertainty." The two terms in the first bracket of Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) comprise the mean value for a product with two attributes, which can be expressed in terms of the claimed and inferred mean attribute levels using Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and its attribute 2 analog. The terms in the second bracket represent the effect of variance or uncertainty on expected utility. These terms are shown in expanded form in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), its attribute 2 analog, and Equation (20). Note that while this expression is a complex function of the variances, it is linear in the attribute incoherences. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions about measurement error, the risk-adjusted preference function can be converted into a model of choice using a logit formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roberts and Urban 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Implications of the Model</head><p>We first analyze the effect of incoherence on preference uncertainty ( §2.6.1) and then study its effect on risk-adjusted preference ( §2.6.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1.">The Effect of Incoherence on Preference</head><p>Uncertainty. To examine the impact of incoherence on preference uncertainty, we substitute the variance in attribute perceptions (Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>) into the preference uncertainty term in Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) to obtain 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">2 v = w 2 1 p 1 • 1 − p 1 • X 1C − X 1I 2 + w 2 2 p 2 • 1 − p 2 • X 2C − X 2I 2 + g 2 1C 2 2C 1C 2C = w 2 1 p 1 • 1 − p 1 • AI 1 + w 2 2 p 2 • 1 − p 2 • AI 2 + g 2 1C 2 2C 1C 2C<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In general, these results imply that incoherence directly increases preference uncertainty. However, this increase in uncertainty will be smaller under two circumstances. First, if the consumer believes that the interattribute correlation is very low, the inference would be more uncertain, resulting in the claim dominating the inference in determining the consumer's attribute perception. Mathematically, 2</p><p>12 in Equation (1) will be large, leading to a higher 2 1I so that (1 − p 1 ) will be very small. Because attribute incoherence</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">X 1C − X 1I 2 is weighted by p 1 • 1 − p 1 in</formula><p>Marketing Science 26(4), pp. 504-513, © 2007 INFORMS Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>), the effect of incoherence on preference uncertainty will be reduced when (1−p 1 ) is small. Second, if the attribute is unimportant (i.e., if w is small), then even high levels of incoherence would have a very small effect on preference uncertainty. This effect is also captured in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>) because the terms X 1C − X 1I 2 and X 2C − X 2I 2 are weighted by w 1 and w 2 , respectively. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> To provide a useful managerial diagnostic, we create an overall measure of product incoherence (PI) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">PI = w 2 1 • p 1 • 1 − p 1 • X 1C − X 1I 2 + w 2 2 • p 2 • 1 − p 2 • X 2C − X 2I 2 (11)</formula><p>which is a weighted sum of the incoherence of each attribute.</p><p>2.6.2. The Effect of Incoherence on Risk-Adjusted Preference. Given two positively valued and positively correlated attributes, attribute 2 incoherence (AI 2 ) increases as the claimed level of attribute 2 increases beyond that inferred from a fixed level of attribute 1. As per §2.6.1, an increase in attribute incoherence increases preference uncertainty, resulting in a negative effect on preference. However, as the claimed level of attribute 2 increases, the consumer's mean perception of attribute 2 also increases, resulting in a positive effect on preference. The net effect of the increasing attribute level on preference then depends on the relative magnitude of the positive and negative effects and the consumer's risk-aversion parameter (i.e., the net effect is a mean-variance trade-off).</p><p>We formally determine the net effect in Appendix T.A3. The main analytical finding is that for a fixed X 1C , preference increases as X 2C increases but only up to a performance level X * 2C , after which preference decreases with further increases in X 2C . Because an increase in X 2C , holding X 1C constant, also implies an increase in incoherence, the net effect of increasing one attribute in isolation on preference generally follows this inverted U-shape curve. If the consumer is highly risk averse, the negative effect of incoherence will overshadow the positive effect quickly, resulting in a curve that is close to strictly downward sloping. In contrast, if the consumer approaches risk neutrality, the curve is strictly upward sloping in the limit.</p><p>For moderate levels of risk aversion, increasing the level of an attribute might increase preference 2 If attribute 1 were not important in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">10</ref>), i.e., w 1 was small, attribute 1 incoherence would not affect preference uncertainty and thus preference. However, the claim on attribute 1, X 1C , could still have a substantial effect on preference through attribute 2 incoherence X 2C − X 2I 2 because X 2I is a function of X 1C . This is consistent with an extensive literature on the impact of irrelevant attributes on preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carpenter et al. 1994</ref>).</p><p>despite increased incoherence, but too much incoherence always hurts preference. This appealing result is consistent with a main finding in the schema incongruity literature (Meyers-Levy and Tybout 1989), which shows that moderate incongruity is preferred over both congruity and extreme incongruity. Its explanation is based on the interaction of affect and cognitive ability in resolving incongruity, while ours emerges from a simpler mean-variance trade-off by a utility-maximizing consumer. Our result is also consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Keller and Aaker's (1992)</ref> findings on the risks of "overextending" a brand.</p><p>To summarize, our model predicts that the magnitude of interattribute correlation determines how strongly incoherence will affect preference uncertainty (see §2.6.1) and therefore risk-adjusted preference. If the interattribute correlation is high, we predict a strong negative effect of incoherence on preference. Thus, the negative incoherence effect of increasing the claimed level of attribute 1 (beyond that inferred from a fixed level of attribute 2) will overshadow its positive mean effect quickly, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship. This net effect will not be as pronounced, nor will it be observed as quickly, in the low interattribute correlation case. Our empirical study tests these predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Assessment of Model Predictions</head><p>An empirical assessment of our model predictions requires a context where (i) there are multiple attributes that significantly determine preference, (ii) consumers have relatively homogenous category experiences so that covariation beliefs can be elicited, and (iii) realistic product concepts can be constructed, with attribute levels manipulated in such a way that incoherence can be varied and measured at the individual level.</p><p>In addition, the task must be relevant to respondents.</p><p>We now describe such a context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Experimental Design</head><p>A context that meets these requirements is the selection of elective courses by second-year students in a major MBA program. In this MBA program, students are asked to respond to a battery of 24 Likert scale teaching effectiveness items (defined here as attributes) at the end of each course. Students use published past ratings of each course on each attribute to select future electives.</p><p>To obtain a measure of expected relationships between attributes in this population, we analyzed historical, individual-level teaching effectiveness data from five large classes. Based on the correlations between the 24 attributes, we selected the following two pairs of attributes to test our prediction that the effect of incoherence on preference depends on interattribute correlation: (1) high interattribute correlation: "The importance of the course to MBA graduates" and "The extent to which the course was interesting," and (2) low interattribute correlation: "The preparedness of the lecturer" and "The extent to which the course was interesting."</p><p>The wording of each of the three Likert scale items was: "This course is important for MBA graduates to understand," "Overall, I think this course is interesting," and "This lecturer is always prepared for class." The average ecological correlation between "importance" and "interesting" was 0.79 (p &lt; 0 001) in the historical teaching effectiveness data, while that between "preparedness" and "interesting" was 0.39 (p &lt; 0 001). Each attribute was a statistically significant driver of overall course assessment.</p><p>We then constructed a hypothetical product (a course here), shown in Appendix T.A4, by describing a prospective second-year elective, providing only the attribute ratings given by students in the previous year. These ratings were declared to be hypotheticalno course or professor names were given to avoid confounding brand-name effects. We presented the ratings in the same summary format to which students were accustomed, with average ratings for the course on each attribute as well as the percentage of responses for each scale point of the five-point scale.</p><p>In our framework, these two measures translate into the mean and variance of the distribution of the claim.</p><p>Next, we constructed several other hypothetical courses that varied in terms of mean performance on each attribute. By varying the mean attribute performance levels, we varied the level of incoherence that would be perceived by respondents. For example, if a respondent believed that "importance" and "interesting" were strongly correlated, then a course with both attributes as good or bad would be viewed as more coherent than a course with level of one attribute high and the other low. We varied the mean of both attributes at two levels (3.0 and 4.5). This 2 (attribute 1 mean) × 2 (attribute 2 mean) design implied that each respondent would rate only four courses. To obtain more data from each respondent, we constructed four additional courses by varying the distribution of past student responses for each scale point on attribute 1 without changing the mean attribute level. Each respondent was shown eight hypothetical courses in a 2 (attribute 1 mean) × 2 (attribute 2 mean) × 2 (attribute 1 variance) within-respondents full factorial design. The two pairs of attributes (high and low correlation) were separately administered as between-respondents conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measurement Procedures</head><p>We recruited 77 second-year MBA students for the experiment, all of whom had completed similar sets of first-year courses and, at the time of the experiment, were making choices of electives for the first term of the second year. We randomly assigned respondents to a between-respondents condition. Betweenrespondents groups were homogenous in terms of demographics (age, gender, and international student proportion).</p><p>In Part 1 of the study, respondents provided ratings of each of the 8-10 courses they took in the first year of the program on the relevant attribute pair, allowing us to estimate individual-level covariation beliefs. In Part 2 of the study, we showed respondents a hypothetical course and measured their perceptions of that course on each attribute and their overall preference for the course (measured on sliding scale that we converted to a 0-100 scale). We repeated these steps for each of the eight courses. We dropped data for four students because their responses had close to zero variance, leaving 73 respondents for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Analysis</head><p>We first used the data from Part 1 to obtain individual-level estimates of the expected interattribute relationship. We fit Equation (1) (and its attribute 2 analog), estimating and for each respondent (denoted by i). We then constructed individual-level estimates of attribute incoherence (AI 1 ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">AI 1 i = X 1C − X 1I i 2 (12)</formula><p>where X 1I i is the estimate of the individual's inference of attribute 1, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X 1I i =ˆ 1 +ˆ 12 i • X 2C<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Analogously, we estimated AI 2 i , attribute 2 incoherence. Individual-level estimates of attribute incoherence provided sufficient dispersion to measure the effect of incoherence on preference. We can rewrite Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) in terms of perceptions of the two attributes and attribute incoherence as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Z i = 0 + 1 • X 1 i + 2 • X 2 i + 3 •AI 1 i + 4 •AI 2 i (14) where 0 = 0 g 2 1 = w 1 , 2 = w 2 , 3 = − r/2 • w 2 1 • p 1 • 1 − p 1 , 4 = − r/2 • w 2 2 • p 2 • 1 − p 2 , 0 ≤ p 1 p 2 ≤ 1, and r w 1 w 2 &gt; 0</formula><p>We can now directly test the predictions of our model by fitting the preference model in Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) to the data. The attributes in our study were positively valued, so we expect 1 and 2 to be positive and significant. The most direct test of the predictions of our model is the sign of the coefficients 3 and 4 , which was expected to be negative as per Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>). As noted in §2.6.2, we expected these  Note. In the high correlation condition, attributes 1 and 2 were "course is important" and "course is interesting," respectively. In the low correlation condition, attributes 1 and 2 were "lecturer is well-prepared" and "course is interesting," respectively. a p &lt; 0 01, b p &lt; 0 05 coefficients to be more significant in the high correlation condition than the low one. In estimating Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we mean centered the variables and corrected for heteroscedasticity to obtain more efficient estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Greene 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Results</head><p>The results of estimating Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The results for the high correlation condition show that both attributes are significant drivers of preference. The key finding relates to the sign and significance of the measures of attribute incoherence. As expected, 3 and 4 are negative and significant. These results show that students will discount their preference for a course that is very interesting but not important (and vice versa). Because the importance of a course and how interesting it is are believed to be highly positively correlated, any substantial departure from this relationship produces incoherence, uncertainty, and lower overall preference. These results are consistent with our model predictions. Results for the low correlation condition also show that both attributes are significant drivers of preference. The interesting finding here is the lack of statistical significance of 3 and 4 . This result suggests that in the range we tested, the correspondence between the level of interest of a course and lecturer preparation does not significantly influence overall preference. Given the weak correlation between the two variables, this result is not unexpected.</p><p>In addition to testing the model predictions, we compared the fit and out-of-sample predictive ability of our model to a null model (Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) without the incoherence terms). The AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion) for our model was smaller than that for the null model (2488 versus 2503) in the high correlation condition but only slightly smaller than that for the null model (2067 versus 2075) in the low correlation condition, as expected. We tested the predictive ability of our model against the null model via a jackknife procedure. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In the high correlation condition, our model predicted better than the null model by 10.08% as measured by the median absolute error. In the low correlation condition, our model predicted better than the null model by 4.22%. Given this rather conservative test of our model-the experiment was designed to be within the range of the past experience of the respondents and, hence, not overtly incoherent-we find this level of predictive validation supportive of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Optimizing Attribute Combinations</head><p>While the previously reported analyses were intended to validate our model's predictions, we can use the empirical estimates obtained for the models in Equations ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) to find the preference-maximizing level of an attribute, given a fixed level of performance on the other attribute. We provide details of this optimization methodology in Appendix A.3. For the average consumer in the high correlation condition of our empirical study, we find that given a claim of 3.00 on the "importance" attribute, the optimal claim on the "interesting" attribute is 4.44. For the low correlation condition, the lack of statistical significance of 3 and 4 does not indicate any constraints on the level of attribute 2 given a fixed level of attribute 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion, Conclusions, and Future Research</head><p>Incoherence presents a risk that marketers often fail to recognize when launching new products, brand extensions, or product repositionings. To address this issue, we built a formal model of the effect of incoherence and its antecedents on preference. We found empirical support for our model prediction that incoherence will have a significant negative effect on preference in the high correlation condition in contrast to the low correlation condition. This research offers two theoretical contributions. First, although incoherence has been studied in the behavioral literature, ours is the first mathematical model of the effect of incoherence and its antecedents on preference. We have calibrated the effect of incoherence and shown how it can be integrated into preference and choice models. Second, we have relaxed the standard assumption of preference independence frequently made in the modeling literature, permitting the development of models with correlated attributes.</p><p>Our research has significant managerial implications. Most significantly, we provide a methodology that can be used to assess the market acceptance of different positions in the multiattribute space after taking into account incoherence. Also, our model calibrates the effect of the antecedents of incoherence on preference, thus allowing managers to understand how to manage the negative effects of incoherence. For example, a manufacturer may purposely accept a lower position on a less important attribute to gain a strong inference on a more important one. Consider the design of Eveready flashlights Australian Financial Review Magazine 2004), purposely designed to look ugly because the company found that sturdy products in this category were usually ugly. A product that is not ugly might be inferred to be less sturdy and therefore less preferred by consumers. In contrast, Body Smarts, a healthy candy line launched by Pfizer with much fanfare, died a quick death perhaps because no attempt was made to deal with the effects of the incoherence of "healthy and candy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beirne 2002)</ref>. Our model can also be used to address product repositioning, new product introduction, and brand extension issues by incorporating it into other models (such as discrete choice models in McFadden 1974 and the ASSESSOR model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Silk and Urban 1978)</ref>.</p><p>While we have made a first step toward developing a model of incoherence, there are limitations, many of which provide opportunities for further research. Our model includes only two attributes and although the approach can be extended to more than two, the mathematics becomes more complex. The utility transformation for the multivariate case (see Appendix T.A2) can be used as a foundation for this extension. We note, however, that in practice two dimensions often can describe the principal components of a set of attributes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hauser and Shugan's 1983</ref> Defender model and the price-quality inferencing literature, Ordonez 1998); our model allows these factors to be oblique. Another extension could involve dynamic updating of covariation beliefs, perhaps in a Bayesian framework. We assume symmetric effects of attributes on each other. It would be useful to relax our model to allow for asymmetric effects (e.g., see <ref type="bibr">Moreau et al. 2001, p. 18)</ref>. It might also be interesting to examine the strategic behavior of firms that account for incoherence-induced uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guo 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Syam et al. 2005</ref>). Finally, it would be useful to examine the model's validity in contexts involving other products and services.</p><p>In addition to the interattribute extensions described here, it would be valuable to generalize our model to situations where incoherence comes from the following combinations: brand-brand (cobranding), brandcategory (product line extensions), brand-attribute (new product development), category-attributes (market development), and brand-marketing mix (positioning and brand support). While this paper is a first attempt to formally model the effect of incoherence and its antecedents on preference, we hope it can provide a platform for further analytical developments and practical applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1Conceptual Model of Perception and Preference Formation For a New Product in an Existing Category</figDesc></figure>
