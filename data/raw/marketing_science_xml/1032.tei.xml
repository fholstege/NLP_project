The accumulation of information across multiple fixations to the ad elements in long-term memory is assumed to be additive. The total amount of accumulated information that is not directly observed but estimated using our model influences both the accuracy and latency of subsequent brand memory. Accurate memory is assumed to occur when the accumulated information exceeds a threshold that varies randomly across ads and consumers in a binary probit-type of model component. The effect of two media-planning variables, the ad's serial position in a magazine and the ad's location on the double page, on the brand memory threshold are specified. We formulate hypotheses on the effects of ad element surface, serial position, and location.</p><p>The model is applied in a study involving a sample of 88 consumers who were exposed to 65 print ads appearing in their natural context in two magazines. The frequency of eye fixations was recorded for each consumer and advertisement with infrared eye-tracking methodology. In a subsequent indirect memory task, consumers identified the brands from pixelated images of the ads. Across the two magazines, fixations to the pictorial and the brand systematically promote accurate brand memory, but text fixations do not. Brand surface has a particularly prominent effect. The more information is extracted from an ad during fixations, the shorter the latency of brand memory is. We find a systematic recency effect: When subjects are exposed to an ad later, they tend to identify it better. In addition, there is a small primacy effect. The effect of the ad's location on the right or left of the page depends on the advertising context. We show how the model supports advertising planning and testing and offer recommendations for further research on the effectiveness of brand communication. In future research the model may be extended to accommodate the effects of repeated exposure to ads, to further detail the representation of strength and association of memory, and to include the effects of creative tactics and media planning variables beyond the ones we included in the present study. <ref type="bibr">(Brand Advertising; Visual Attention; Brand Memory; Hierarchical Bayes)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The first stage in the mental stream of thought leading to a purchase is attention. Thus, the first function of an advertisement is to attract attention. (C.H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sandage 1945)</ref> The number of brands in the marketplace has vastly increased in the 1980s and 1990s, and the amount of money spent on advertising has run parallel. Print advertising is a major communication instrument for advertisers, with estimated spending of over 30 billion dollars in 1995 in the United States alone. However, print media have become cluttered with advertisements for brands: many magazines have half of their pages or more carrying advertisements <ref type="bibr">(Batra et al. 1996, Ha and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Litman 1997)</ref>. It has become difficult to attract consumers' attention in these cluttered media environments. Advertisements that fail to gain consumers' attention cannot be effective, but attention is not sufficient: Advertising needs to leave durable traces of brands in memory. It is a challenge for advertisers to rise high above the clutter of competing ads and to gain the attention of potential customers to build and sustain brand awareness. To achieve this goal, advertisers need to understand how consumers pay attention to print advertisements and how that contributes to memory for the advertised brands.</p><p>However, despite its importance to advertising effectiveness and "despite the tremendous amount of money spent on buying consumer attention, little to no research is done on attention" <ref type="bibr">(Janiszewski and Bickart 1994, p. 329)</ref>. Only recently a number of studies in marketing have aimed to fill the void in knowledge of attention processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Janiszewski 1990a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Janiszewski , 1990b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Janiszewski , 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Olney et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rosbergen et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pieters et al. 1999)</ref>. Our study contributes to this emerging stream of literature in several ways. First, following up on studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rayner (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suppes (1994)</ref>, we propose a formal model describing how attention processes promote memory for the advertised brands. Specifically, we model the eye-fixations to advertisements and their effect on subsequent memory for the brand. The model is explicitly derived from recent developments in the theory of visual attention and memory. We accommodate the influence of ad-design variables (for example, the size of key ad elements, brand, pictorial, and text) on attention and of media planning factors, and of the ad's serial position and page location on memory performance. We test the model using disaggregate measures of attention and memory for a large sample of advertisements. Eye fixations on print ad elements and the subsequent accuracy and speed of memory for the advertised brands are assessed in a sample of 88 consumers and 65 print advertisements. Infrared eye-tracking methodology is used to record eye fixations and a perceptual identification task is used to assess brand memory. We investigate the influence for a large sample of advertisements, which is unique. Finally, we adopt a Bayesian approach to estimate the model and extensively investigate the model's assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A Model of Eye-Fixations Effects on Memory for Brands</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suppes (1994)</ref>, what is missing in eyemovement research is a serious account of the processing that takes place to store information in longterm memory. In the remainder we attempt to provide such an account through the development of a formal model. The model is a hierarchical Bayesian model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gelman et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Gilks et al. 1996</ref>, but, rather than postulating such a model as a mere data-analysis tool, we derive it from substantive theory on attention and memory, and we test its assumptions after it has been estimated. Although we are still somewhat remote from a true microlevel process model of attention and memory processes that is estimable from actual data, we believe we make a first step towards its development.</p><p>Before the model components are described in detail, we provide a brief overview that may serve to keep track of the sections that follow. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> provides a flow diagram of the process and collected data. The model is calibrated to eye-movement data that are collected during experimental exposure of 88 subjects to 65 ads, in two magazines, and subsequent recognition of the brand in a perceptual memory task (described in §3). During exposure to the ads, we record the frequencies of fixations on three ad elements: brand, pictorial, and text; and, during the memory task, the accuracy and latency of memory. Thus, the available data for each subject consist of the numbers of fixations on the ad elements (denoted by n), and the accuracy (denoted by y), and the latency (denoted by t) of memory.</p><p>In formulating the model, we assume that subjects have different eye-fixation rates for the different ad elements (because of which a negative binomial model of fixation frequency arises), and specify the influence of the size of the ad elements ( §2.1). It is assumed ( §2.2) that the number of fixations, not their duration, is related to the amount of information a consumer extracts from an ad. The information chunks extracted at each fixation are assumed to be random, varying across ads and consumers, and are estimated from the observed data. The accumulation of information across multiple fixations to the ad elements in long-term memory is assumed to be additive ( §2.3). The total amount of accumulated information (denoted by D) that is not directly observed, but estimated using our model, influences both the accuracy and latency of subsequent brand memory. Accurate memory is assumed to occur when the accumulated information exceeds a threshold that varies randomly across ads and consumers in a binary probit-type of model component. The effect of two media-planning variables, the ad's serial position in a magazine and the ad's location on the double page, on the brand memory threshold are specified ( §2.4 and 2.5). In the following sections we provide a detailed motivation of the model components and their assumptions, based on the extant literature on attention and memory. At the same time, a review of that literature is provided, which serves to support our hypotheses of the effects of ad element surface, serial position, and location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Duration and Frequency of Eye Fixations</head><p>Besides several smaller corrective movements, eye movements comprise a sequence of fixations, discrete periods of relative immobility of the eye, and saccades, which are quick jumps between fixation locations. Extraction of information occurs during fixations, reflecting moments of attention to the stimulus, whereas vision is basically suppressed during saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sperling and Weichselgartner 1995)</ref>. Because theoretical work commonly uses a random control process for fixation duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McConkie et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Henderson 1992</ref>, we assume fixation duration to have a constant termination hazard. This leads to the exponential distribution of the duration of individual fixations that has been empirically corroborated <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Viviani 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Henderson 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suppes 1994)</ref>. The duration of fixations has been shown to depend on stimulus features such as information type <ref type="bibr">(pictorial vs. textual, Rayner 1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr">complexity (McConkie 1983)</ref>. To account for such an adaptation of the control process to differences between ad elements, we let the termination hazard of a fixation depend on ad element j. The total number of fixations, n ijl , by consumer i at element j of ad l then follows a Poisson distribution. To account for the observed heterogeneity across consumers in fixation frequency to ad elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pieters et al. 1999)</ref>, we let the parameter of the Poisson distribution follow a gamma distribution across consumers, which leads to the Negative Binomial Distribution for the fixation frequency. 1 n |␣ , ␣ ϳ NBD(␣ , ␣ ).</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ijl 1j 2j 1j 2j</formula><p>We include ad-designvariables in the model to account for their effect on attention. Surface is an important "mechanical" feature that may affect the amount of attention that ad elements receive. Starch research has consistently found that the surface size of the pictorial increases the likelihood of the ad being attended to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Finn 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Hanssens and Weitz 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Rossiter 1981</ref>. The influence of the text surface is less established (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Finn 1988</ref> for an overview) although, surprisingly, no research to date has analyzed the influence of the brand's surface on attention. Because attention tends to be devoted disproportionately to the most meaningful elements of stimuli (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Just and</ref><ref type="bibr">Carpenter 1988, Loftus and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mackworth 1978)</ref>, we hypothesize that the surface size of the brand element, the key identifier of the ad, has the largest influence on fixation frequency. Because reading is cognitively taxing, requiring multiple (re)fixations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rayner 1998)</ref>, we expect that the surface of the text element has the second largest influence on fixation frequency. Finally, because few fixations may suffice to grasp the meaning of pictorials (McConkie 1983), we expect the surface of the pictorial to have the smallest influence on eye fixations. To test these hypotheses, we parameterize the negative binomial distribution of fixation frequency of each ad element as a function of its surface (in dm 2 ): , ␣ ‫ס‬ w Јq 1j j j with w j a (2 ‫ן‬ 1) vector, including an intercept dummy. The parameters q j reflect attention weights of the ad elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bundesen 1990)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Extraction of Information During Eye Fixations</head><p>It appears that the attention system adapts the duration of fixations to local features of the stimulus to keep an approximately equal information rate per fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McConkie et al. 1994)</ref>. For instance, longer fixations during reading mainly serve to improve the accuracy of the landing position of the next fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coeffe and O'Regan 1987)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Loftus (1972, p. 525-551)</ref> ". . . it might be assumed that information about a picture is transferred to LTS [the long-term memory store] in discrete chunks, with each chunk corresponding to a fixation." After such transfer, we assume that the information extracted per fixation is approximately constant. Let k ‫ס‬ 1, . . . , n ijl denote fixations. Then, the information extracted by subject i at the k-th fixation from the j elements of the l-th ad is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a s ‫ס‬ l ‫ם‬ r f ‫ם‬ r t .</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">ijkl j j l j i</formula><p>Here, l j is the expected quantity of information and f l ϳ N(0,1) and t i ϳ N(0,1) are random effects for advertisement l and consumer i, respectively. The parameters and ( j ‫ס‬ 1, . . . , J) represent the variability in a s r r j j pictorial, textual, and brand information extracted across ads and across consumers. The model thus postulates two independent sources of heterogeneity in the information extracted from the ad. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Accumulation of Information in Memory</head><p>We assume that the information of each of the J types extracted during a fixation is added to the information already present in long-term memory, where it forms new and strengthens existing memory traces and forms associations with other memory traces. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hintzman (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Raaijmakers and Shiffrin (1992)</ref>, who specify the memory intensity to be the sum of the activation levels of all memory traces. Thus, after having attended to an ad, the total amount of information that a consumer i has stored on ad l is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">J n ijl ‫ס‬ il ͚ ͚ ijkl j‫1ס‬ k‫1ס‬ J a s ‫ס‬ (n l ‫ם‬ n r f ‫ם‬ n r t ).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>͚ ijl j ijl j l ijl j i j‫1ס‬</p><p>Conditional upon n l ‫ס‬ (n ijl ), the accumulated information follows a multivariate normal distribution: ( ilkl , . . . , iJkl )Ј ϳ MVN(l, R s ‫ם‬ R a ). The l j 's represent the strengths of the memory traces of the J-types, and captures their variability across con-</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 s s R ‫ס‬ diag(r ) j</formula><p>sumers. We assume the memory traces for the ad elements to be independent across consumers. The matrix R a captures the variability across advertisements, where the off-diagonal elements relate to the associations between the memory traces of the J types. Note that our model captures the structure of long-term associative memory in a somewhat crude way, involving only the strengths and associations among J (brand, pictorial, text) types of memory nodes.</p><p>2</p><p>The authors are grateful to Asim Ansari for suggesting this dualheterogeneity representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Effect of Eye Fixations on Accuracy of Brand Memory</head><p>Memory of the advertised brands is indicated by the accuracy and speed of identifying them <ref type="bibr">(LaBerge 1995, Richardson-Klavehn and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bjork 1988)</ref>. We assume that accurate brand memory occurs when the total amount of information stored in LTM exceeds threshold h il , so that it can be retrieved. The threshold parameter varies across advertisements, because some brands are inherently more easy to identify (lower threshold) or are more familiar (prior information and the threshold are not separately identified in this study) <ref type="bibr">(Hawley and Johnston 1991, p. 809)</ref>. In addition, it varies across consumers to accommodate differences in prior knowledge or motivation and ability to retrieve the brands from memory:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">s a h ‫ס‬ g ‫ם‬ w ‫ם‬ w x , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">) il i l</formula><p>Here, i ϳ N(0,1) and x l ϳ N(0,1) are random effects for consumer i and advertisement l, respectively. The parameters w s and w a represent the standard errors (s.e.) of the threshold distribution across consumers and ads, respectively. The parameter g is the expected value of the threshold. This specification is consistent with the work in psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Busemeyer and</ref><ref type="bibr">Townsend 1993, Kruschke 1996)</ref> and marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Krishnan and Chakravarti 1993)</ref> on memory thresholds, which we extend by allowing the threshold to vary across both advertisements and consumers. Media planning variables, such as those pertaining to the location of the ads in the print media, may affect brand memory by increasing or decreasing the memory threshold. In this study we examine the serial position (front to back) and the page location (right or left) of advertisements, both of which are under marketing control and may influence brand memory <ref type="bibr">(Rossiter and Percy 1997)</ref>. Basic memory research consistently reports serial-position effects: primacy (firstto-last advantage) and recency (last-to-first advantage) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Greene 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Raaijmakers and Shiffrin 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Wyer and Srull 1986</ref>. However, serial-position findings from Starch scores are ambiguous <ref type="bibr">(Finn 1988, Table 1)</ref>. Starch research on the influence of page location also reports variously no, positive, and negative effects of the ad at the right (or left) page <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Finn 1988</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The present model allows tests of the influence of the ad's serial position and page location on the memory threshold. To account for primacy and recency effects simultaneously, we include both a linear and a quadratic term in serial position. A significant linear term identifies a primacy, if positive, or a recency effect, if negative. An additional quadratic term is expected to be positive when both primacy and recency effects are present. We model the threshold variation over ads ‫ס‬ g ‫ם‬ w a x l ) as a function of the q ‫ס‬ 1, . . . , Q (h l media-planning variables, ‫ס‬ j ‫ם‬ ms l , with z l ‫ס‬ h zЈ l l (z lq ) and s l ϳ N(0,1). The memory indicator, y il ‫ס‬ 1 if brand l is accurately retrieved from memory, and y il ‫ס‬ 0 if not, is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y |p ϳ Binomial(1, p ). (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">il il il</formula><p>Accurate brand memory is assumed to occur with a probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p ‫ס‬ Pr( ‫ם‬ ⑀ Ͼ h ) ‫ס‬ Pr(D Ͼ ‫⑀מ‬ ), (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">il il il il il il</formula><p>where D il is implicitly defined and ⑀ il is the error occurring in memory retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hawley and Johnston 1991)</ref>, assumed to follow a standard normal distribution. This leads to the probability of accurate memory retrieval of the brand to be p il ‫ס‬ 1 ‫מ‬ U(D il ), with U(•) the cumulative normal distribution function. Note that because of the functional form of the normal CDF, the marginal effect of the additive accumulated information on accurate brand memory is decreasing, which is desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kahneman 1973)</ref> and is in agreement with other models of memory retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bundesen 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Raaijmakers and Shiffrin 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Effect of Eye Fixations on Latency of Brand Memory</head><p>Similar to memory accuracy, the speed of brand memory depends on the amount of information accumulated in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sergent and</ref><ref type="bibr">Takane 1987, Richardson-Klavehn and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bjork 1988)</ref>. We therefore also model latency of brand memory t il as a function of the total amount of information accumulated D il . Because the latency of brand memory is nonnegative, we model latency as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">t ‫ס‬ exp(c ‫ם‬ c D ‫ם‬ d ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>il 0 1 il il with c ‫ס‬ (c 0 , c 1 )Ј parameters and d il |n 2 ϳ N(0, n 2 ) normally distributed error in retrieval, response, and recording, with n its s.e., so that the log latency is approximately constant, given the information retrieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Estimation and Checks of the Model</head><p>The model is estimated in a Bayesian framework, using an MCMC estimation algorithm (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gelman et al. 1995 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gilks et al. 1996)</ref>.

The algorithm is described and tested in the Appendix.</p><p>Our model was built from a series of assumptions derived from attention and memory theory, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Because most of these assumptions have not yet been empirically tested, we subject our model to those tests. Rather than testing several nested and/or nonnested versions of the model to examine the adequacy of the model and test the assumptions, we choose the strategy to investigate whether the posterior distribution subsets of the parameters concentrate around zero, coupled with an extensive analysis of the model's residuals. An attractive feature of the MCMC methodology is that one can obtain accurate approximations of the small sample distributions of test statistics. These are computed from the Pearson residuals and fitted values from the parameter estimates N (r) at each iterate r.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Participants and Stimulus Material</head><p>A random sample of 88 female consumers between 19 and 52 years of age, were invited to the market research agency that collected the data. The stimulus material comprised all full-page advertisements inserted in two consumer magazines. The first magazine is an issue of a popular weekly magazine of a large retailer (Allerhande). It contains 108 pages, including 30 fullpage advertisements. The ads promote food products (wine, tea, ice cream, eggs, coffee, meat, soup, dairy products, candy), personal care products (shampoo, bath foam, shaving foam, deodorant), cigarettes, and magazines. The second magazine is an issue of a glossy monthly magazine (Cosmopolitan) containing 128 pages and 35 full-page advertisements. The ads promote different personal care products (after-shave, nail polish, eau de toilette, body lotion), lingerie, cars, cigarettes, magazines, and food products (fruit juice, sauces, beer). Advertisements are located throughout the target magazines with different facing editorial material.</p><p>All sixty-five ads contain the three key ad elements: brand, pictorial, and text.</p></div>

Another camera records the pages to which the magazine is opened. The computer also matches the information of eye movements and magazine pages such that the exact locations of individual fixations on the magazine become available. For all sixty-five ads, fixation frequencies on the three ad elements-brand, pictorial and text-were recorded. We define the brand element of print advertisements as all pictorial and textual references to the brand, including the name, logo, symbols, and packshot. The pictorial element includes all pictorial information in the advertisement, such as illustrations, but excluding the brand symbols. The textual element includes all text in the advertisement, such as the headline, sublines, payoff, and body text but excludes references to the brand name. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> offers a front and a side view of the experimental setup.</p><p>The front view shows the infrared eye-tracking equipment, with the infrared and head location cameras and the control panel at the top, the page recognition camera and an adjustable glass sheet in the middle, and the table with a magazine at the bottom. The side view shows a person paging freely through a magazine. The glass sheet between the magazine and the person reflects the infrared light beam coming from the top onto the cornea, and from the cornea back to the top, but all other light passes. After eye-movement recording, participants engaged in another unrelated study, which took about 20 minutes and was followed by the surprise memory task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Perceptual Memory Task</head><p>An indirect (perceptual) memory task was used to assess attention effects on brand memory. In an indirect memory task, participants engage in a cognitive or motor activity, with instructions referring only to the task without time-and location-retrieval cues, and without references to prior exposure to the stimuli (Richardson-Klavehn and Bjork 1988). To probe perceptual memory, a specific form of indirect memory, participants identify stimuli that are incomplete, presented briefly, or perceptually degraded <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hawley and Johnston 1991)</ref>. The strength of perceptual memory then is assessed as the increased accuracy and/or speed with which participants identify the target stimuli after exposure.</p><p>There are several considerations that favored the use of an indirect memory task, specifically, a perceptual memory task, in this study. First, the goal of advertising is to promote memory for the advertised brandsindirect memory-instead of memory for the advertisements-direct memory- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Krishnan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chakravarti 1993, 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, indirect memory measures tend to have a lower threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cowan 1995)</ref> and thus are more sensitive to the small effects of advertisements in highly competitive media <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jacoby and Dallas 1981)</ref>. Also, in making daily decisions for low-involvement products, consumers tend to invest little effort in retrieving explicit information from advertisements and instead may rely more heavily on their indirect perceptual memory (cf. <ref type="bibr">Krishnan and Shapiro 1996)</ref>. The perceptual memory task was administered as follows. Participants were seated individually in front of an NEC 21-inch, touch-sensitive monitor to assess perceptual memory for brands. They received detailed instructions and examples of the task. On the monitor, the 65 advertisements from the two magazines were shown, as well as 10 other ads (mirroring the target ads in products and design), in random order. Pixelated images of the advertisements were shown (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hawley and Johnston 1991)</ref>, in which colors and forms of pictorials and logos remain largely intact, and big type from brand name, headline, and subheadings can be identified. Each ad was accompanied by four brand names. Participants were asked to identify the target brand in the ad as soon as possible by touching the correct brand name on the screen. The distracting brand names were chosen to maximize the likelihood of incorrect choices in case of guessing. Accuracy of brand memory and response latency were recorded for each advertisement and consumer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Findings</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents a number of descriptive statistics for the data. On average, the pictorial has the largest surface, followed by text and then brand, for both magazines. Allerhande has half of its ads on the right page, which is somewhat more than that for Cosmopolitan. For both magazines, consumers fixate most frequently on the pictorial, followed by the text and then the brand. Accurate identification of the brands occurs in around half of the cases, which takes consumers 2.5 seconds on average. The model was calibrated to the data on the two magazines separately, which allows us to compare results across advertising vehicles. We report the findings by model component below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Fixation Frequency on Ad Elements</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents the median and 95% credible intervals of the posterior distribution of the fixation frequency parameters. As predicted, the largest effect of the surface of the ad elements is observed for the brand. The text receives less fixations per surface area, the pictorial the least. The disproportionately high unit-fixation frequencies on the brand relative to the other two ad elements is striking. This supports our hypothesis that the brand element is the most meaningful ad element. The posterior distributions of the fixation frequency parameters for the two magazines do not overlap. The brand surface effect is higher for Allerhande than for Cosmopolitan, while the reverse holds for the pictorial  and text. This may be explained by the editorial content of the magazines, which is much more focused on shopping and brand information for Allerhande (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pieters and Warlop 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Accuracy of Brand Memory</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> offers the median and 95% credible intervals of the posterior distributions of the information parameters. Brand memory for ads in Allerhande was less accurate than for ads in Cosmopolitan (as reflected in a higher value of the memory threshold parameter). The heterogeneity in brand memory is larger for Allerhande than for Cosmopolitan, and it is significantly larger across advertisements than across consumers. This indicates that differences in brand memory between advertisements are more prominent than differences between consumers.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the parameter estimates of the effects of the media planning variables on memory threshold. There is strong evidence of a recency effect in serial position: The threshold decreases with an increasing page number, leading to better memory. The quadratic effect is positive for both magazines, but the 95% credible interval covers the zero value for Allerhande. This quadratic effect is indicative of a primacy effect as well as a recency effect, although the effect of the latter is stronger and more consistent across the two magazines. The effect of page location reverses signs between the magazines: For Allerhande the positive parameter value indicates a better memory of left-page ads, the negative sign for Cosmopolitan indicates better memory of right-page ads.</p><p>For both magazines, the amount of information extracted on a single fixation decreases from the brand to pictorial to text (reflected in the posterior medians of l 1 , l 2 , and l 3 ). Thus, although the brand has the smallest surface of the ad elements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), and although consumers fixate less frequently on the brand element (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), it receives the most fixations per surface unit (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) and, moreover, delivers most information for subsequent accurate brand memory. This underlines the importance of eye fixations on the brand element of advertisements in building brand memory. The posterior distribution of brand information is very similar across the two magazines and there is substantial heterogeneity across ads and consumers.</p><p>Although the pictorial elements do not contain the brand name, logo, or pack shot, eye fixations on the pictorial do deliver information relevant for later brand memory (l 2 ). The amount of information extracted is half or less than that extracted by fixations on the brand but is still substantial (for Allerhande ads the pictorial contributes less information, and the 95% credible interval just covers the zero value). The amounts of pictorial information extracted vary considerably across ads and consumers. These findings underscore the signal value that pictorials have for brand memory, the differences in sensitivity of consumers for pictorial information, and the differences in quality of pictorials to contribute to brand memory.</p><p>Note that although the fine print in the body text tends to become illegible because of the ad pixilation in our memory task, the headline, subheadline and payoff remain legible in most cases. In addition, the block of body text is clearly recognizable, and its shape, color, and location provide contextual cues for brand memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bundesen 1990)</ref>. Still, for both magazines, the 95% interval of the information extracted from the text element of the advertisements (l 3 ) covers the zero value. Hence, eye fixations on the text elements of advertisements in this study, on average, do not yield information that promotes brand memory. The amount of variation of textual information across ads and consumers is fairly large and is comparable to that of the pictorial information, so that for some ads there may be a significant brand memory trace associated with textual information. The posterior distributions of the correlations among the threshold, brand, pictorial, and textual information, indicative of associations among those memory traces, all concentrate around the zero value (they are, therefore, not shown in the table).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Latency of Brand Memory</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> presents the results for the latency of brand memory. The mean response time, adjusted for the information extracted during exposure to the ads, is quite similar to that for ads in Allerhande and in Cosmopolitan. As expected, the information effect of eye fixations on identification latency is negative in both studies. This shows that, as predicted, information accumulated in memory through eye fixations promotes faster identification of brands. The effect is significantly more prominent in Cosmopolitan than in Allerhande. Note that the effects of brand, pictorial, and text fixations on latency are proportional to those reported in the previous section. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Diagnostic Checks</head><p>Because our model assumptions, derived from attention and memory theory, have mostly not been subjected to stringent empirical testing in previous research, we perform an extensive series of model checks, based on the posterior distribution of the test statistics that we described earlier. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the test statistics computed. The majority of the assumptions cannot be rejected based on the data: From the 38 residual tests performed, only five appeared "significant." For all ad elements the information extracted follows an approximate normal distribution and is not correlated with the total number of fixations, the total amount of information does not display serial correlation, and there is no evidence for q(e ,ñ ) n (0.02, 0.08). This indicates a slight nonlinear effect of the pictorial surface. Text fixations in Cosmopolitan show a similar effect (0.03, 0.07). Because these correlations are very low and the large number of tests may give rise to some chance capitalization, we have not modified the model and conclude that it is quite a reasonable description of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Ever since <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Karslake (1940)</ref> used the Purdue Eye Camera to collect eye-movement data on advertisements appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, research in this area has been hampered by the lack of adequate models for the analysis of eye-tracking data. This has prevented the accumulation of generalizable findings on attention for advertising and its effects on brand memory. The model outlined here provides the first step towards a formal conceptualization and representation of attention processes that build memory for brands. Rather than developing a mere data-analysis tool, we have gone to great lengths to provide a representation of the processes of fixation and memory based on current theory on those processes, supporting each of the assumptions made from previous literature. The proposed model of attention and memory processes can facilitate future research in marketing, as each of its parameters has substantive meaning and can be conditioned on relevant ad, media, and consumer characteristics. Of course, the model is only a first step, and many of its aspects need further detail and future testing. It may be extended, for example, to accommodate the effects of repeated exposure to ads, to further detail the representation of strength and association of memory, and to include the effects of ad layout characteristics and media planning variables beyond the ones we included in the present study.</p><p>Starch scores have been fruitfully used for almost a century to support advertising and media planning decisions. Most academic research based on Starch scores has focused on the role of pictorial and textual, mechanical, and psycholinguistic features of advertisements. Unfortunately, Starch results are difficult to interpret because they are retrospective reports of attention, which confound attention and memory processes by asking consumers to remember how they previously paid attention to ads. Eye-tracking data allow proper tests of the attention effects of the surface size of ad elements and other ad design characteristics. Our findings based on such eye-tracking data reveal a surprising amount of information in the brand element of ads. On average, the surface of the brand element was much smaller than the surface of the pictorial (about 10 times) and the text (about 3-5 times) elements of the print advertisements. In addition, the fixation frequency on the brand element is much lower than the fixation frequencies on the pictorial and text elements. However, the brand element receives by far the most eye fixations per unit of its surface, followed by the text element and the pictorial. Although we predicted that the brand element would receive the most eye fixations per surface unit, the large differences with the text and pictorial element are striking. They show that even in an exploratory search context in which consumers freely page through magazines, and in which they dwell only for a short moment on each ad (less than 3 seconds), the brand element draws a disproportionately large amount of attention. These findings support marketing's longtime emphasis on the role of the brand in advertising. At the same time, they underline the incomplete and potentially erroneous results of previous advertising research that has ignored brand effects on attention and memory. Ours is the first study to identify the magnitude of the brand effect using direct measures of attention across a large sample of ads. The significant effect of fixations to the pictorial attests to the importance of visual cues in building brand memory. The nonsignificance of text effects on brand memory in this study may be partly intrinsic to the specific task used, but it also supports previous findings that memory for textual information is less than that for pictorial information. The use of explicit verbal cues in the memory task, such as words from the headline or the payoff, may result in larger effects of text fixations on brand memory, and future research may pursue this.</p><p>Combined, our findings on the importance of the brand element might stimulate marketers to greatly enlarge the brand surface of ads in order to maximize ad effectiveness. Several considerations warn against injudicious application of such a strategy. First, in our study most attention in an absolute sense went to the pictorial of the ads, and the textual element also received more attention than the brand element did. Second, the pictorial element had an effect not to be ignored, on brand memory. Also, the heterogeneity in the effect of the textual information indicates that for some ads, the text did contribute to brand memory. Third, ads need to gain attention and build brand memory across repeated exposures, and the ad's sensitivity to attention and memory wearout may well be higher when the brand surface is disproportionately large. In our sample of ads, the variation in brand element surface was limited. Whereas the ad sample was large and comprised ads across product categories from two different magazines, only with great caution should the effects of ad element surface be extrapolated beyond the range of values in this study.</p><p>The identified strong recency effect is consistent with the model and findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wyer and Srull (1986)</ref>. They show recency effects under conditions of high information load, which we believe to be similar to what consumers were facing in our study. Under high information load, earlier stimuli tend to be displaced from short-term memory by later stimuli in the sequence, which lowers the likelihood of the earlier stimuli being stored and subsequently retrieved. Retroactive inhibition in long-term memory by later stimuli in the sequence may further contribute to retrieval difficulties of the earlier stimuli, which adds to the recency effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burke and Srull 1988)</ref>. This suggests that advertisers who seek to maximize brand memory may want to place their ads towards the end of magazines. However, albeit smaller in magnitude and only significant in one of the two magazines, we also recovered a primacy effect. This primacy effect may be dependent upon the advertising context: the fact that it was not significant for Allerhande may have been caused by it being cluttered with (large and small) advertisements. Longer time intervals between exposure and memory retrieval, repeated exposures, and advertising contexts may modify the recency and primacy effects found in this study. The effect of page position on the memory threshold differed between magazines. A tentative explanation might be that a majority of full-page ads in Allerhande (80%) and only a minority of full-page ads in Cosmopolitan (25%) was faced by a page with multiple small ads. Most ads in Cosmopolitan were faced by editorial material. Perhaps location effects are positive when the left page contains editorial material but negative when the left page contains ads for competing brands. The result calls for further research into the effects of media context on advertising effectiveness. In the meantime, the recommendation of <ref type="bibr">Rossiter and Percy (1997, Chapter 10</ref>) not to adjust systematically for page location in media planning seems warranted.</p><p>We are somewhat reluctant to formulate "universal" recommendations for print-ad execution, as our study has assessed attention and memory in highly controlled conditions. Rather, we think that ad strategy implications should be derived from empirical generalizations drawn from a larger number of studies involving more widely varying measures and conditions. Keeping these reservations in mind, we believe that our model and findings are pertinent to at least two crucial components of ad execution: copy and media strategy. First, the estimates of the effects of ad characteristics on attention and of the information quantities extracted are instrumental in the development of copy strategy. Our study suggests that the effects of ad element surfaces on attention are relatively invariable across advertising contexts, which may be an important asset in the development of advertising copy. In addition, the information extracted from the brand element was very similar across advertising media. It is remarkable that previous attention research, in particular the many studies based on Starch data, have taught us surprisingly little about the role of the brand, the element that is most informative to consumers and most important to advertisers and ad agencies. Based on our findings, advertisers and agencies would be well advised to examine in detail the role of the brand element in copytesting and to pay due attention to it in the development of copy strategy. Our model can be a useful tool in that process. Second, the identified effects of media planning variables on memory are instrumental in the development of media plans. The effects of media planning variables (serial position and location) on brand memory appeared to vary across the two media contexts that were included in our study. This underlines the importance of accommodating the advertising context in ad location decisions, in which preferred print ad locations should depend on the particular medium choice. Support for advertising strategy decisions, including media class selection, copy execution, editorial fit, scheduling, and timing, require that additional media planning variables and ad characteristics be investigated, which we will do in the near future. 5</p></div>

After the burn-in, all chains were stationary. Convergence was checked also by running additional (shorter) chains. We take the posterior median and 95% credible regions as characterizations of the posterior distributions of the parameters. To test the algorithm and investigate identification, we generate two synthetic data sets.
