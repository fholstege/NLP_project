<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Instances of co-creation, the participation of potential customers in the production of goods and services, continue to increase in number and importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Pine and Gilmore 1999)</ref>. Collaborating with customers to co-create products has always been commonplace in business-to-business (B2B) settings, well before the current proliferation of business-to-consumer (B2C) instances. Specifically, user participation in the design of products, especially in business-to-business contexts, is the earliest and most prominent manifestation of product co-creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Griffin and Hauser 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Thomke and von Hippel 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, von Hippel and Katz 2002</ref>. Recent advances in information technology and flexible manufacturing have greatly enhanced the ability of firms and customers to co-create products such as cameras, copier finishers, laptop bags, laundry products, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Redstrom 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Sawhney et al. 2005</ref>. Paris Miki, a Japanese eyewear retailer, has developed a system where designs are created in close collaboration with its customers; customers complete the design task by selecting options for the nose bridge, hinges, and arms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gilmore and Pine 1997)</ref>. eMachineshop.com provides individuals the ability to create their own tools by allowing access to an infrastructure that was hitherto available only to "real" manufacturers.</p><p>Academic researchers have also turned their attention to co-creation, with an emphasis on viewing the customer as a coproducer of goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jaworski and Kohli 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ramaswamy 2000, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vargo and Lusch 2004)</ref>. Our goal in this paper is to rigorously model co-creation and to determine the optimal cooperative productive efforts of the firm and the consumer as well as the pricing by the firm. There are two types of co-creation: proprietary and nonproprietary <ref type="bibr">(Bessen 2006, Rossi and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bonaccorsi 2006)</ref>. The types differ in the ownership structure and distribution of the final product. Nonproprietary co-creation, which has the flavor of public goods, describes environments wherein the firm and its customers invest in creating a better product that is then distributed freely to all users (open source software, for example). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bramoulle and Kranton (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ballester et al. (2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Zenou (2004)</ref> interpreted the efforts of the agents as product innovations and treated such innovations as strict public goods. Proprietary co-creation, on the other hand, refers to situations where customers participate in the development of the product but the firm retains ownership and can sell the final product. Proprietary cocreation has flavors of both public and private goods.</p><p>In this paper, we study co-creation environments where the price mechanism is crucial in mediating the value exchanged between the firm and the customer, i.e., the proprietary setting. Customers can benefit not only from the effort of the firm but also from the efforts and resources of their fellow customers. Specifically, some users may be "experts" 1 in that their needs are similar to others and their efforts can substantially benefit other customers. Consider the phenomenon of lead users in business markets. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Lead users are at the forefront of emerging trends and can help other users with their product solutions. In this paper, we broaden the definitions and denote as experts/lead users those customers who are able to substantially benefit other users through their innovation efforts. Consider, for example, the oil and gas industry. Original equipment manufacturers of generators and turbines (e.g., GE, Simmons, Mitsubishi) develop their products jointly with big advanced multinational oil companies (e.g., ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron). After the development stage, the manufacturer aims to sell the equipment to all potential end users (including many less sophisticated users, such as Petronas or Sonangol) with the appropriate fine-tuning and customizations. This forms an oil and gas network of co-creators where the firm is connected to its lead users and regular customers. The former help in the development of the new product, and their expertise benefits all potential users. The efforts of the latter are concentrated on working with the manufacturers to fine-tune and customize the products for their own use. This paper captures three different aspects of co-creation: (1) Customers and firms both contribute to the design of products. Thus there are production externalities between customers and the firm. (2) Some customers have capabilities or expertise that are of value to other customers in the market. Thus there are production externalities among customers. (3) Firms charge for products co-created with the help of customers.</p><p>We compare and contrast optimal effort levels as well as firm prices and profits in several representative environments. We compare the basic no cocreation case to the intermediate case, where there are no lead users but every customer can improve his or her product directly with the firm (no links between users), to the advanced cases that include lead users whose efforts improve the products of all users or more diffused connections between similar users. We further investigate the optimality of price discrimination by the firm when there are lead users (i.e., when they charge different prices to lead and regular users).</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant literature; §3 presents our general findings and the intuition behind them. The general model is developed in §4. Section 5 provides robustness checks for the main results of §4. Section 6 is devoted to the analysis of the benefits of a single price over price discrimination, and §7 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Much of the research that deals with the production externalities of the type that we study has appeared in the networks literature. The existing literature that examines networks and externalities can be broadly divided into three streams. The first and earliest research stream covers only network externalities. Crucially, this literature (implicitly) assumes that every agent (be it a firm or a customer) is connected to every other agent. In the terminology of graph theory, these papers assume a "complete" graph and ignore the specific pattern of connections between agents (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shapiro 1985, Farrell and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Saloner 1985)</ref> The second stream of work examines network topology, but it tackles only the problem of agent contributions (or efforts) and how agents optimally determine their contributions given the network of connections. Thus, it has the flavor of contributions to a "public good," where the pattern of externalities is given by the topology of local network effects. Prominent papers in this group include <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bramoulle and Kranton (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ballester et al. (2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Zenou (2004)</ref>. We differ in two respects. First, and most importantly, we investigate proprietary situations where firm pricing plays an important role. Second, we focus on specific patterns of externalities (i.e., network structures) that incorporate the fact that certain agents, the lead users, are experts who benefit their fellow users. Both aspects are critical to co-creation and have not been examined by the above public goods literature. A recent paper, Chennamaneni and Desiraju (2011), investigates these public good inefficiencies in the context of comarketing alliances and offers a contractual solution to these problems, though the issues of network topology and ownership and the selling of a product are not investigated.</p><p>The third and nascent research stream examines pricing in networks and accounts for local network effects, but the firms and customers play completely distinct and different roles. Firms set prices, and the customers determine their contributions. There is no effort contribution on the part of firms, and the only decision for consumers to make is whether to buy or not buy the offered products. Thus, these papers can be thought of as investigating consumption externality rather than production externality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Banerji and</ref><ref type="bibr">Dutta 2009, Bloch and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Quérou 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Co-creation involves both the joint contribution of the firm and customers in designing a product and the firm's pricing. This paper takes a first step towards understanding the importance of both network connections and pricing in the co-creation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Intuition</head><p>In this paper, we analyze co-creation between a firm and a set of users, where the users can further be connected among themselves according to specific patterns of externalities. We analyze three canonical externality patterns. In the network literature, these patterns correspond to different networks: the first has no connections among users (null pattern), the second has an expert/lead user at the center who is connected to the other users called neighbors (centralized pattern), and the third has no recognized expert among the users, all of whom have symmetric connections (decentralized pattern). See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for a depiction of these externality patterns.</p><p>We have three main results. First, a centralized pattern of externalities, with a lead user in the center, can be more profitable than both the null and decentralized patterns of externalities, even though for a given number of customers, the decentralized pattern has more links than the centralized pattern. The networks literature has shown that the pattern of links as well as the number of links matters, but more importantly, we demonstrate in our specific context exactly how the pattern of links affects cocreation efforts and profits. Specifically, a firm facing a centralized pattern of links can be more profitable than one facing a decentralized pattern, even when all spillovers among customers are the same in both cases. Thus, we provide a novel justification for the use of a lead user by a profit-seeking firm. The benefit of the lead user does not depend on her having a lower cost or greater ability compared with the firm (the usual reasons advanced in the trade press to justify a lead user) but on the fact that she is central in the production network. When the spillover from the lead user to other customers increases, the firm increases its effort and therefore can increase its price. This force is absent in a decentralized network. Therefore for high spillover, a centralized network is always more profitable than a decentralized network.</p><p>Our second result states that if users are connected by a centralized externality pattern, then when the lead user increases her spillover to the other users, all the involved parties benefit: the firm's profit, the lead user's expected utility, and the other users' expected utilities all increase. The spillover of the lead user captures the extent to which her effort can benefit the other users connected to her. Thus we show that when the lead user's effort is more beneficial to the other users, both she and the firm benefit. As mentioned above, a higher spillover from the lead user increases the effort the firm exerts, and this benefits the lead user. Even though the price increases, the positive effect dominates, and the lead user's expected utility increases in her spillover.</p><p>An interesting implication of the above is that the lead user and the firm are not mere substitute experts in the creation of value. In fact, they complement each other. Having a better (more representative or better connected) lead user should not cause the firm to reduce its creative effort; instead, the firm should increase it.</p><p>Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 805-820, © 2013 INFORMS Our third finding shows that when customers are connected by a centralized pattern of externalities (with a clear distinction between lead users and regular users), it is better for the firm to charge a single price than to price discriminate, even if it is a monopolist. It is well documented that through price discrimination, the firm can better extract the surplus of heterogeneous customers. However, in co-creation environments, this turns out to be problematic for the firm. Price discrimination leads to reduced consumer surplus, which in turn causes consumers to rationally reduce their co-creation efforts. Because the firm's profit increases in the total efforts exerted, price discriminating reduces profit compared with charging a single price. In a sense, by agreeing to not price discriminate, the firm signals to the customers that they will retain more of their co-creation efforts, leading them to increase their contribution enough to offset the firm's losses from not customizing the prices. The extant literature has shown the suboptimality of price discrimination when firms compete for customers (especially in behavior-based schemes). Our result is similar to the potential extra profitability of a monopolist's ability to commit to a single price for a good over several time periods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fudenberg and Villas-Boas 2006)</ref>. The point of difference lies in the mechanism by which this occurs in the two situations: in co-creation, the commitment to a single price changes consumers' incentives to expend effort on product development; in the behavior-based pricing literature, it changes the consumers' timing of purchase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A Model of Co-Creation with Production Externalities</head><p>Consider a situation where several agents engage in joint production (of a product or service) with a monopolist firm. In co-creation each agent is a usercreator who will participate in joint production with the firm and perhaps with other fellow user-creators, and this agent may purchase the final product for its own use. We conceptualize cooperative production as a network of contributors, with each user-creator represented by a node. The links in the network of externalities represent the potential effect of one user's effort on the other's overall utility. In the remainder of the paper, we will refer to the user-creators simply as users. We also assume that the firm is (by definition) connected to all users. Thus, the specific patterns of externalities that we will investigate (null, centralized, and decentralized) refer only to the pattern of links between the users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">No Externalities Among Users</head><p>In this section we analyze the case where there are no links between the users themselves, so that each user's effort does not benefit other users. We can think of each user as exerting effort to better fit the product for his or her own specific circumstances. We refer to this base case as the null network.</p><p>As a base case, we investigate an environment with a single firm and U symmetric users. Let the production "effort" of the firm be e f and that of a user be e u . It is important that our use of the term "effort" does not confuse the reader; we use the term here to capture the amount of innovation or product design that an agent contributes. The literature on contributions to open source software uses the term in the same spirit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hindricks and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pancs 2002, Johnson 2002</ref>). The newer literature on public goods in networks, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bramoulle and Kranton (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ballester et al. (2006)</ref>, also interprets an agent's efforts as innovation attempts. Agents could innovate by experimenting with new technology or by generating new information that is shared among their network of partners in a collaborative venture. In this sense the innovation efforts of various agents are observable. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Each user benefits from the combined total effort of all agents connected to him. Specifically, we define the total effortẽ u at a user's node as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e u = e u + f e f<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where f ≤ 1 represents the degree of effort substitutability between the firm and all the users. The user's benefit is thus a function b • of the above total effort. We also assume a convex cost of effort c • with c 0 = 0. The total consumer surplus is given by CS u = b ẽ u − ce 2 u − p u + , where p u is the price charged to a user for the co-created product, and is a zero mean random variable representing uncertainty the user has about the fit of the products to her needs. This fit parameter is unknown to the consumer during the development stage and is revealed to her once the product is available in the market. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The firm only knows the distribution of the fit parameters in the population, never its actual realizations. Throughout the paper we assume that is distributed uniformly on <ref type="bibr">[− ]</ref>. To concentrate on the network effect, we assume that the cost coefficient c is also the same across all users.</p><p>The competitive environment unfolds in three stages. In the first stage, both the customers and the firm determine their innovation effort levels and then exert that effort. In the second stage, the prototype Firm and customers determine and exert efforts Firm sets prices Consumers evaluate product fit and decide whether to buy or not is available, and by observing effort levels, the firm determines the prices. In the third stage customers evaluate the fit of the product and make their purchase decisions. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts this timeline.</p><p>Note the importance of the first stage in the cocreation game. When users exert their innovation effort, they do not know the fit of the final product to their needs. Thus, depending on the magnitude of the fit parameter, there is a positive probability that the customers will not purchase the co-created product (despite exerting a costly effort). Rational consumers must take into account the probability of non-purchase when making their effort decisions in the first stage. Moreover, at the last stage, when agents make their purchase decisions, their cost of effort has already been incurred in the first stage and is considered to be sunk for the buying decision.</p><p>To solve for the optimal prices and effort level, we use the concept of a subgame-perfect equilibrium and backwards induction. Starting at the last stage, given a price p u , a user will purchase the product with probability given by Pr &gt; p u − b ẽ u . The probability that a user purchases is thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Pr[User u buys] = + b ẽ u − p u 2 (2)</formula><p>Notice that the cost, c e u , does not figure in the probability calculation because when the user makes the purchase decision, the cost of co-creation is already sunk (determined in the first stage). The expected profit of the firm is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f = U • + b ẽ u − p u 2 p u − c e f<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In the second stage, the firm chooses p u optimally; the first-order condition (FOC) gives the price in terms of the efforts:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p u = + b ẽ u 2 (4)</formula><p>Note that the price charged to a user is increasing in the benefit a user gets from joint production with the firm, b ẽ u , and so it is increasing in the user's own effort, e u . Intuitively, the firm can extract the benefit that the user enjoys by consuming the product, and the product's benefit increases in e u . We now turn to the first stage and determine the optimal efforts of the firm and the users. The expected profit of the firm after price has been incorporated from ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= U + b ẽ u 2 8 − c e f<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Next, we need to calculate the expected consumer surplus of the users. A given user, u, will realize the exact value of the product fit only after the effort choice.</p><p>Thus if the product is ultimately a poor fit, the user may not buy in the future despite the efforts exerted in the development stage. This fact needs to be incorporated in the calculation of the expected consumer surplus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E CS u = E CS u if u buys u buys Pr u buys + E CS u if u doesn't buy u doesn't buy • Pr u doesn't buy − c e u</formula><p>Notice that the user incurs the cost of effort, regardless of whether she buys the product in the future or not. Also, as already noted, the probability of purchase in the future is independent of the cost of effort.</p><p>Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E CS u = E b ẽ u − p u + ≥ p u − b ẽ u • Pr ≥ p u − b ẽ u − c e u = b ẽ u − p u + E ≥ p u − b ẽ u • + b ẽ u − p u 2 − c e u</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This gives us</head><formula xml:id="formula_7">E CS u = 1/4 + b ẽ u − p u 2</formula><p>− c e u . After substituting the price from (4), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E CS u = 1 16 + b ẽ u 2 − c e u (6)</formula><p>The optimal effort profile e = e f e u is solved by maximizing ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref> For the sake of tractability, we assume that the benefit function is linear and the cost is quadratic. Yet, as §5 shows, the results hold for more general functions. Specifically, we assume that b ẽ u = e u = e u + f e f and c e u = ce 2 u . The solutions for the users' and the firm's efforts are shown in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 805-820, © 2013 INFORMS respectively; 5 all optimal quantities are denoted with a superscript that corresponds to the network type:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">e Null u = 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 (7) e Null f = 2 f U 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 (8)</formula><p>For participants to exert an effort (an interior solution), we need e Null f &gt; 0 and e Null f &gt; 0. For these to be satisfied, we need</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">16c − 2 2 f U − 1 &gt; 0 (9)</formula><p>In the rest of the paper, we maintain this assumption. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Note that the parameter restriction is satisfied as long as the number of users is not too large; that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U &lt; 16c − 1 / 2 f .</formula><p>Clearly, the optimal effort of the firm increases in U , the number of users. This is due to the pricing effect. Without pricing, the firm would be just another agent creating a product with other economic agents; this is akin to a public goods situation. The public goods literature has found free riding to be prominent, and as the number of agents increases, the problem of free riding is exacerbated. We show that allowing the firm to own the product and set its prices reverses the free-riding effect caused by the public goods nature of co-creation. Finally, the optimal price and profit of the firm can be obtained by suitable substitutions. We state these criteria as Proposition 1.</p><p>Proposition 1. When a monopolist firm co-creates a product with U homogeneous users with no connections between them ( forming a null pattern of externalities), then the optimal effort of each user is e Null u = / 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 , and the optimal firm effort is e Null</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f = 2 f U / 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 . The firm's profit is given by Null = 4c 2 U 8c − 2 f U / 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 2 .</formula><p>It is straightforward to check that if 8c − 1 &gt; 0, the optimal profit of the firm increases in the number of users U that it is connected to. 7 This is an immediate consequence of the price effect. Even though the firm's own effort increases in the number of users, leading to a higher cost of co-creation, the increase in price with an increase in U more than makes up for that increased cost.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">U = 8c 2 4c 16c − 1 + 2 f U 8c − 1 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 3</formula><p>As a benchmark we analyze the case without cocreation, where the users are merely price takers as in traditional markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Benchmark Without Co-Creation.</head><p>A monopolist firm creates and sells a product to U homogeneous users who do not exert effort. Suppose the firm first chooses its design effort and then its price. The optimal effort and profit of the firm are</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">e No-Co-creation f = f U 8c − 2 f U No-Co-creation = c 2 U 8c − 2 f U</formula><p>Proof. See the appendix.</p><p>A direct comparison of the monopolist's profits with and without co-creation yields the following result.</p><p>Corollary. Suppose that a monopolist has the option of co-creating products with its customers. The monopolist's profit from choosing co-creation, even when there are no links among users ( Null ), is higher than that with no co-creation ( No-Co-creation ).</p><p>This result follows from the convexity of the cost function, but it is still useful to point out. In subsequent sections we analyze the more challenging cases where there are different networks of externalities between the users, and we perform profit comparisons between networks under different functional forms of the cost and benefit functions. Because users do not innovate or create in a vacuum, an analysis of the patterns of externalities between users is a salient aspect of co-creation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Centralized Pattern of Externalities</head><p>Among Users Although theoretically there could be many patterns of links between users, the most common in practice is that with an expert user whose productive input benefits all other users. A prominent example is the lead user phenomenon, which has been the most well established and widely studied method for user design, especially in B2B markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(von Hippel 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(von Hippel , 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Urban and von Hippel 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Though very common in business markets, the expert user phenomenon finds resonance in consumer markets as well. For example, at Threadless.com, customers, usually amateur designers at the forefront of fashion trends, can send in their own T-shirt designs. Popular designs are then printed and sold as a newly created product. In software design, beta testers are often expert users.</p><p>In this subsection we analyze the case where there are links among the users themselves. These links form a centralized network with the expert/lead user at the center. In terms of the network literature, the centralized network is an important canonical one, which captures situations where one expert agent has more connections, and more impact, than all other agents.</p><p>The analysis of this case is more complex than that presented in §4.1 because the agents are not symmetric with respect to their numbers of links, and so we have to allow for an asymmetric equilibrium in effort and choice.

We assume that the firm can charge different prices to the neighbors and the lead user. It is straightforward to assume different benefit functions b l • and b n • for the lead user and neighbors, respectively, but we lay these aside to focus on the network structure.</p><p>Proceeding similarly to §4.1, the probability that a customer of type i purchases is Pr[User i buys] = + b ẽ i − p i / 2 , where i = 1 n.

When the spillover from the lead user to the neighbors is not too large ( l &lt; N n ), the lead user exerts a greater effort and also faces a higher price than the neighbors.</p><p>From ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) we see that the price paid by a user increases in the total benefit she receives, and therefore in the total effort accruing at the user's node. The total benefit received by the lead user is higher than a neighbor if the spillover from the lead user to the neighbors ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is smaller than the total spillover from all the neighbors to the lead user (N n ). By contrast, the neighbor pays a higher price and the lead user a lower price when the spillover from the lead user is higher than the spillover from the neighbor. The following result states the main finding of this section.</p><p>Theorem 1. (a) When the users have a centralized pattern of externalities among them, the lead user's and the neighbors' expected surplus as well as the firm's profit all increase in the lead user's spillover, l .</p><p>(b) The firm's equilibrium profit and effort are higher if it co-creates with users who are connected to each other by a centralized pattern of externalities than if it co-creates with users who do not have any connections with each other ( Centr &gt; Null and e Centr f &gt; e Null f ).</p><p>Part (a) of Theorem 1 provides one of the main insights of the paper: when the lead user's spillover increases, i.e., when her effort is more beneficial to her neighbors, all parties-the lead user, the neighbor, and the firm-benefit. Interestingly, the symbiotic relationship between the lead user and firm occurs independently of their costs and abilities and also independently of the spillover f between them. It can be argued that a lead user is more effective when her efforts are more beneficial to the other users. Our analysis shows that everyone benefits when the lead user becomes more effective, even though "effective" is defined here only as being advantageous for other users (the neighbors) and not for the lead user or the firm directly.</p><p>A further implication of Theorem 1, part (a) is that the efforts of the firm and the lead user are not substitutes: a better (more representative or better connected) lead user is not a reason for the firm to lower its creative effort. Thus, the lead user and the firm are not mere substitute experts in the creation of value. In fact, they complement each other.</p><p>The intuition is as follows. In a centralized network, as the spillover of the lead user ( l ) increases from a given initial level, the benefit to the neighbors goes up as a result of two different effects: the direct benefit increases and the probability of buying increases. The price charged by the firm will increase as well but only by half the benefit (see Equation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)); overall, the neighbors will benefit. In fact, the neighbors will now choose to exert a greater effort themselves. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> As a result of increased spillovers by the lead users, the neighbors are not content to just receive the extra benefit; they actually increase their own effort as well to gain even more utility. In response to this increase, the firm will not only increase its price to the neighbors but will also increase its effort to make even higher profits (using a similar argument to the neighbors' increase). Now, the lead user is faced with greater firm and neighbor efforts and thus finds it beneficial to increase her own effort as well. Greater efforts by all parties create a larger benefit for the lead user, and though the price increases as well, it increases by only half of the extra benefit. This leads to a higher surplus for the lead user.</p><p>The endogenous efforts also explain why the profit from a centralized network of externalities, with a lead user in the center, is higher than co-creation with a null network of externalities. Because the efforts of the firm, lead user, and neighbors in the centralized network are greater than the corresponding efforts in the null network, the total efforts are greater for the centralized network. This results in higher prices and thus higher profits for the centralized network compared to the null network. Thus the firm benefits from the lead user.</p><p>The rationale for using the lead user described in the previous paragraph is novel. We have not assumed any differential cost or information between the firm and the lead user, the usual argument presented in the trade press for why lead users may be valuable. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The business press holds that lead users are privy to information that firms do not have, especially product use information since they are users themselves. Lacking the knowledge required for product-use-related innovations, firms find it beneficial to co-opt the lead user's innovations on that dimension. This information asymmetry is not needed to obtain our result, which is driven purely by the network centrality of the lead user.</p><p>Note that there is an increase in the number of links when we go from a null network to a centralized network; part of the reason why the centralized network is more profitable could be attributed to the number of links. We demonstrate below the importance of the pattern of links as opposed to just the number of links. We prove the stronger result that the centralized externality network can be more profitable than the decentralized externality network even though the decentralized network has more links between users. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Recall that CS n = 1/ 16 + b ẽ n 2 − c e n . So the marginal benefit equals marginal cost equation is 1/ 8 + b ẽ n b ẽ n = c e n . Since increasing 1 unequivocally increases the left-hand side, the optimal choice of e n increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Decentralized Pattern of Externalities</head><p>Among Users We now analyze the case where links between the users form a decentralized network. We focus only on links among users. For U users, a decentralized (circle) network has U links among users, whereas a centralized (star) network has U − 1 links among users (if we include links to the firm as well, then the number of links is 2U and 2U − 1, respectively). The main reason for analyzing a decentralized network is to establish that a centralized network of externalities with a recognized expert (lead user) can yield higher profits than the decentralized network, despite having fewer links than its counterpart.</p><p>In the networks literature, the decentralized network is one of the important canonical networks. It captures situations where the agents are symmetric and connected to each other but there is no recognized expert in the network. A decentralized network can emerge when there is social learning among agents who are "close" to each other in terms of their tastes and/or preferences, and there is only local observation among agents (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Goyal 2007, p. 97;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerji and Dutta 2009)</ref>. We number the U nodes from 1 through U . The total effortẽ u at a user u's node (1 &lt; u &lt; U ) is e u = e u + u e u−1 = u e u+1 + f e f Each node u benefits from the efforts expended by her two neighbors, (u − 1) and (u + 1). Here, u is the effort spillover between users. As in the two previous sections, the firm's optimal price is p u = + b ẽ u /2, and a user's consumer surplus after incorporating the firm's optimal price is CS u = 1/ 16 + b ẽ u 2 − c e u with b ẽ u = b e u + u e u−1 + u e u+1 + f e f .</p><p>The FOC for user u is 1/8 + b ẽ u = c e u . Using symmetry, linear benefits and quadratic costs yield the optimal efforts of the firm and the users with a decentralized network:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">e Decentr u = 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 − 2 u e Decentr f = 2 f U 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 − 2 u (21)</formula><p>The firm's profit is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Decentr = 4c 2 U 8c − 2 f U 16c − 2 2 f U − 1 − 2 u 2 (22)</formula><p>Comparing the profit with the null network given in Corollary 1, we immediately see that the firm's profit with a decentralized network is higher.</p><p>The main result of this section compares the firm's profit from a centralized network with that from a decentralized network. To make the comparison, we assume that all users in the decentralized network have the same spillover as the neighbors in the centralized network; that is, u = n . In this way we can focus on the lead user's spillover l , since it is the presence of the expert/lead user that is the major difference between the two networks.</p><p>Theorem 2. There exist critical valuesˆ 1 andˆ n of the lead user's and neighbor's spillovers such that, for n &lt;ˆ n and 1 &gt;ˆ 1 , environments with centralized externality patterns among users are more profitable for the firm than environments with decentralized externality patterns.</p><p>Proof. See the appendix. To understand the above, first note that if n = 0, the decentralized network reduces to the null network. We have already shown in part (b) of Theorem 1 that the firm is better off under a centralized network than with the null network. Using continuity arguments, the same holds for small n . Now, the decentralized network does not have a lead user, and the firm's profit clearly does not depend on l . On the other hand, the firm's profit with the centralized network increases in l , as seen in Theorem 1, part (a). So if we let u = n and allow l to increase, the profits of the centralized network will eventually exceed that of the decentralized one. The only question is, would we get the same result for the allowed values of the spillover parameter, l ≤ 1? If we set l = 1, one can see that for values of n that are not too large, the firm's profit under the decentralized network is indeed lower than under a centralized one. The decentralized network has more links than the centralized network, which shows that the centralized network can be more profitable because of the pattern of links and not the number of links. Our finding is consistent with the networks literature, which has shown that the pattern of links matters. More importantly, we demonstrate exactly how it matters in our specific context. In co-creation it can be more profitable for the firm when the customers form a centralized pattern of links among themselves than when they form a decentralized pattern. As shown below, this is true even when the spillovers among users are the same in both cases.</p><p>Note that it is possible for the centralized network of externalities to dominate the decentralized one even when the lead user and the neighbors have the same spillovers on each other, l = n . This occurs when the minimum of the profit difference Centr − Decentr is positive, where the minimum difference corresponds to l = n (recall that, by assumption, l ≥ n ). Thus the centralized network can dominate the decentralized network even when all the spillovers in both networks are exactly the same; u = n = l . For example, with c = 1, = 1,  u = l = n = 0 2, and U ranging from 10 to 25, the profits of the centralized structure exceed those of the decentralized one, with improvement values ranging from 0.4% to 0.8%.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> depicts the profit difference as a function of the lead user's spillover l for several values of the neighbor spillover. Since l ≥ n , each graph starts at the point l = n . The graph shows that the profit difference is indeed increasing in l , but it is also higher for lower values of n .</p></div>

When a monopolist co-creates a product with customers who form a centralized pattern of externalities, its optimal profit is higher if it charges a single price to all agents than if it price discriminates between the lead user and neighbors. Both the lead user and firm's optimal efforts are also higher with a single price.</p><p>Proof. See the appendix. We find that even in the more general centralized network, with both the lead user and neighbors exerting co-creation effort (as in §4.2), the monopolist is better off without price discrimination compared with a situation where it price discriminates. This result stands in contrast to the situation in traditional markets without co-creation, where customers do not exert product development efforts-in those cases, price discrimination is always better for the monopolist. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The reason for this result is that price discrimination by the monopolist has two opposite effects: First, it can better extract the surplus of heterogeneous customers; this is the standard positive effect of price discrimination on profits, as is well documented in the literature. Second, because of the reduced surplus left with them, consumers rationally reduce their co-creation efforts; this reduces the "benefit" of the product as captured by the total efforts exerted by all network partners. Because the firm's price is increasing in the efforts exerted, this second force has a negative effect on firm profits, and Theorem 3 shows that the negative effect dominates. The second effect is clearly seen from the fact that for the lead user, e SP l &gt; e PD l . In fact, in so far as the efforts are concerned, there is a double effect when the firm price discriminates-not only does the lead user exert less effort but so does the firm. That is, e SP f &gt; e PD f (see the proof of Theorem 3 in the appendix).</p><p>Our finding above has practical ramifications. Despite the opportunity to price discriminate, in many B2B settings, firms often have a strict "nodiscount" book price policy. Our analysis shows that for co-creation, this self-imposed lack of pricing flexibility may actually be profit enhancing. This result is reminiscent of similar game-theoretic findings where a commitment by a monopolist to a certain action (thus limiting its flexibility) causes a change in customer behavior that is profitable to the monopolist. For example, a monopolistic firm that can profitably employ behavior-based price discrimination may wish instead to commit to a single price over time. This commitment will change the purchase timing of the customers and lead to higher Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 805-820, © 2013 INFORMS profits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fudenberg and Villas-Boas 2006</ref> for a survey and Fudenberg and Tirole 2000 for a similar result in a competitive setting). However, the mechanism through which this occurs in co-creation (changing consumers' incentives to expend effort on product development) is different than the mechanism through which it occurs in the literature on behavior-based pricing, changing consumers' timing of purchase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The idea that producers and consumers collaborate to co-create goods and services has a long history in business and marketing thought. In B2B contexts, co-creation has always been a common phenomenon. Recently, however, with increases in information technology support, flexible manufacturing, and advanced user interfaces, it has become increasingly feasible for customers to participate in the production process even in the B2C world. Despite the great deal of interest in co-creation, there has been little academic research in this field, especially with a view to developing economic models of this phenomenon. This paper takes a first step toward addressing this gap.</p><p>We model co-creation and the interaction between firm and users/consumers as a network of externalities. Each user is located on a node of the network. Any two users whose innovation efforts affect each other are depicted as connected nodes. This particular network topology can be used to capture the specific pattern of production externalities between different users; of course, the firm is assumed to be connected to all of them. This setting allows us to model the important role played by lead users in the innovation process. Lead users can be modeled in the network simply as central nodes with many connections to other nodes, each with a user on it.</p><p>Variants of our model can be used to analyze many other phenomena that involve team production or joint production. In team selling, especially for complex products, some team members are more likely to benefit other members. These asymmetric effects in sales teams can be captured by the pattern of links in a network and by different spillover coefficients. As another example, it is well known that people often construct their preferences for novel products rather than having preformed preferences. Such construction occurs over social networks wherein people discuss novel product features with each other. Clearly, these social connections can be modeled using our network approach, and the disproportionate influence of some members can be captured by the number of connections and the size of the spillover effects.</p><p>In our specific model, we find that the firm's profit from co-creation dominates its profit in a no co-creation environment. Also, pricing by the firm reverses the usual free-riding effect found in public goods, so that in co-creation, the firm's effort increases in the number of users it is connected to. If there are connections among users such that they form a centralized pattern of externalities with a lead user in the center, the optimal profit is higher than that without user connections. Furthermore, the centralized externality network can generate higher profit than the decentralized one even though the latter has more links, even in cases where the spillovers among users are identical in both cases. This highlights the importance of the pattern of links in co-creation production networks as well as the number of links. Another insight our model provides is that as the spillovers from the lead user to the neighbors increase, all parties can benefit, including the neighbors, the firm, and the lead user herself. Finally, we find that it is better for the monopolist firm to charge a single price in a centralized network than to price discriminate between the lead user and her connected neighbors.</p><p>Our analysis has clear managerial implications. First, firms should try to identify and develop alliances with users that are central to the network, i.e., users who have production externalities with many other users, even when such central users do not have lower marginal costs or more product knowledge compared to the firm. The user innovation literature exhorts firms to identify and build alliances with lead users who can foresee emerging trends in the marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(von Hippel 1986)</ref>. Another economic reason for a firm to ally with customers is that customers may have lower costs or higher innovation ability than the firm, especially in B2B contexts. Clearly, it is difficult to identify customers who can foresee future trends and who have lower costs or higher abilities. Thus identifying lead users according to the usual prescriptions may be difficult. The lead user literature views the identification of lead users as a major obstacle. We show that it may be beneficial to just identify users who are linked to many other customers informally or through strategic alliances and other types of research and development networks. In some circumstances a user's network of connections may be more publicly observable than its costs and abilities, which are internal to its functioning.</p><p>Second, in terms of pricing regimes, firms should consider their effect on the effort exerted in the innovation and production stages. It is sometimes better for the firm to commit to charging a single price than to price discriminate in the presence of lead users in the network. In B2B settings, despite the opportunity to price discriminate, many firms often have a strict no-discount book price policy. Our analysis shows that for co-creation, this self-imposed lack of pricing flexibility may actually be profit enhancing.</p><p>f e f , and the surplus a user receives is b ẽ u − p u + .

In the proof of Theorem 1, we already established that Centr / l &gt; 0; that is, the profit of the firm with the centralized network increases in the spillover from the lead user to her neighbors.

If Centr &gt; Decentr even at the minimum value of l , which is l = n , then we are done. If Centr &lt; Decentr at l = n , then the difference Centr − Decentr increases as l increases from its minimum value n . We will show that Centr &gt; Decentr when Centr is evaluated at l = 1. This will establish that there exists a valuê l of the lead user's spillover such that the centralized network is more profitable than the decentralized network for every l &gt;ˆ l .</p><p>Since the expressions are cumbersome, we will simplify them by setting c = 1 and = 1.

Now, using the same techniques as in Theorem 1, we can show that Centr / nl &gt; 0. Since this holds for any l , including l = 1, therefore Centr l →1 n →0 is clearly a lower bound of Centr l →1 . In other words, Centr l →1 n →0 &lt; Centr l →1 . Hence, we are done if we can show that Centr l →1 n →0 &gt; Decentr . Substituting l = 1 and n = 0, the profit from the centralized network reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">Centr l →1 n →0 = 4 2 048U − 248 − 2 f 16U − 1 2 225 − 2 2 f 16U − 1 2 The firm's profit with the decentralized network is Decentr = 4U 8 − 2 f U / 15 − 2 2 f U − 2 n 2 .

The minimum value of the derivative is e SP l / f l =1 = 4 f N + 1 / 15 − 2 2 f N + 1 2 .
