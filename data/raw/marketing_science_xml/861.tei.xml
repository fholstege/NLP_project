<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A brand choice model with heterogeneous price-threshold parameters is used to investigate a three-regime piecewise-linear stochastic utility function. The model is used to explore the relationships between aspects of consumer price sensitivity and price thresholds using hierarchical Bayes modeling with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This study contributes to the modeling literature on discontinuous likelihoods in choice models. The empirical application using our scanner panel data set shows that the reference effect and loss aversion are more marked after price thresholds are taken into heterogeneous price response models. Furthermore, loss aversion is attenuated by using price thresholds than by an aggregate (homogeneity) model without price thresholds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Asymmetric price effects are an active area of research in marketing. Beginning with the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Helson (1964)</ref> who first motivated the usefulness of including reference prices in sales and choice models, researchers have found asymmetric effects and the presence of price thresholds that reflect the presence of discontinuities in consumer behavior. The literature includes findings of asymmetric effect relative to the reference price <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kahneman and Tversky 1979)</ref>, the disappearance of these effects in models that account for heterogeneity in price sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al. 1999, Bell and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lattin 2000)</ref>, and models in which price has no effect within a price interval, i.e., a latitude of price acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gupta and Cooper 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Kalwani and Yim 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Kalyanaram and Little 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Han et al. 2001</ref>. However, models with threshold effects yielding intervals of price acceptance have yet to be estimated heterogeneously.</p><p>This paper introduces a heterogeneous choice model with reference prices, asymmetric responses, and price thresholds. It is characterized as a piecewise linear form so that consumers switch their utility structure accordingly as determined by the relationship between the sticker shock; i.e., the difference between retail price and reference price, and price thresholds. Heterogeneity is incorporated through a random-effects specification that allows determination of the relationship between the threshold values and consumer characteristics. MCMC algorithms are provided for estimation. The model is illustrated using a scanner panel data set of instant-coffee purchases.</p><p>Our model contributes to the modeling literature on discontinuous likelihoods. Price thresholds generate unconventional likelihood functions and discreteness at the threshold values that make it impossible to estimate with gradient-based methods such as maximum likelihood. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gilbride and Allenby (2004)</ref> for models with consideration sets, the Bayesian method of data augmentation is ideally suited for handling discontinuities in the likelihood surface. Here, the thresholds are associated with alternative likelihood functions that result in an apportionment of household data to alternative models. Thus, the model contributes to the marketing literature on structural heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Yang and Allenby 2000)</ref> by allowing for abrupt changes among alternative models within the unit of analysis.</p><p>Our empirical application adds to the literature on the presence of reference prices and loss aversion that initially began with effects uncovered in scanner data, for example, as indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Winer (1986)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mayhew and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Winer (1992), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Putler (1992)</ref>, and then <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref> showed that reference price effects disappear when heterogeneity is incorporated. Our empirical application shows that the reference effect and loss aversion return-at least for the data used in this study-after price thresholds are taken into a heterogeneous model. In doing so, the The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our stochastic utility function and its consequent choice model-the threshold Probit model-and we develop a hierarchical Bayes modeling for it. Section 3 describes the application of scanner panel data to our model. Section 4 concludes this paper. The appendix explains details of the model estimation including the algorithm for hierarchical Bayes modeling via MCMC.</p></div>

We also suppose that consumer h has a reference price RP jht for brand j, and two price thresholds r 1h and r 2h r 1h &lt; 0 &lt; r 2h . Consequently, we define the three regimes-gain " g ," price acceptance " a ," loss " l "-utility function to brand j as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U jht =                          u g jh + X g jht * g h + g jht ≡U g jht if P jht − RP jht ≤ r 1h u a jh + X a jht * a h + a jht ≡U a jht if r 1h &lt; P jht − RP jht ≤ r 2h u l jh + X l jht * l h + l jht ≡U l jht if r 2h &lt; P jht − RP jht (1)</formula><p>where X i jht is the k-dimensional row vector of explanatory variables allocated to regime i according to the level of sticker shock P jht − RP jht P jht : the retail price exposed to consumer h) at the occasion, and k-dimensional column vectors * i h , i = g a l, represent different market responses around the reference price.

Model (i): aggregate (homogeneous) reference price Probit model without a threshold; Model (ii): two-regime heterogeneous reference price Probit model without a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bell and Lattin 2000)</ref>; Model (iii): threeregime heterogeneous reference price Probit model with thresholds.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> displays our utility function. In order for the second regime of the utility function (1) to be characterized as the LPA, and for r 1h and r 2h to be interpreted as price thresholds literally, i.e., for our proposed model to be recognized as a pricethreshold model, we impose the restriction of insensitiveness on the price-response parameter in the LPA regime as a hp ∼ N 0 a hp 2 , which is an element of * a h . Under the assumption of consumer homogeneity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalyanaram and Little (1994)</ref> estimated symmetric LPA that had an insignificant price-response estimate over this range. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Han et al. (2001)</ref> find a significant response parameter estimate in the LPA. We note that their framework differs from ours particularly in the respect that they use the same data set throughout regimes. In contrast, our modeling method allocates data into three regimes.</p><p>Following the standard multinomial-brand choice model, we assume that consumer h is observed to make a choice at the period t between m alternatives (c ht = j . That choice is driven by the relative utility from the last brand y jht = U jht − U mht among latent utilities U nht , n = 1 2 m. We consider a panel of H households observed over T h periods for each household. Conditional on the vector of threshold r h = r 1h r 2h for consumer h, the underlying latent structure at period t when the latent utility induced by the choice belongs to the regime i, the so-called "within subject model for regime i" is expressed in the form of m − 1 dimensional multiple regression,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y i ht = X i ht i h + i ht i ht ∼ N 0 i h = 1 H t = 1 T i h i = g a l (2)</formula><p>Marketing Science 25(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">384-391, © 2006 INFORMS</ref> where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y i ht is the m − 1 dimensional relative-utility vector, X i ht is the m − 1 × k + m − 1 explanatory variable matrix measured from the last brand, i h is k + m − 1 dimensional coefficient vector, i ht</formula><p>is the m − 1 dimensional stochastic-error vector, and we have the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T g h + T a h + T l h = T h .

Conditional on the value of r h = r 1h r 2h , the operation generates the latent utility with three different likelihood functions for consumer h.

Prior distributions and MCMC estimation procedures for these hierarchical Bayes models are described in the appendix.</p><p>The proposed model is difficult to estimate with conventional methods because the likelihood is not differentiable in r h . Conventional maximum likelihood estimation collapses and classical asymptotic distribution theory is not operative on this parameter, and it must therefore rely on an adaptive approach: conditioned on some specific value of r h , estimation is conducted through extensive use of goodness-of-fit criterion, like AIC, in the way of a grid search to find the estimate that minimizes the criterion.</p><p>In the price-threshold literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalyanaram and Little (1994)</ref> assume symmetric LPA by setting r h1 = r h2 = r (homogeneous), and they estimate not the threshold but the length of LPA, where several possible lengths are specified a priori, and they seek the LPA that has an insignificant estimate of price response inside this range. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kalwani and Yim (1992)</ref> take a grid search approach. This approach does not allow statistical inferences such as testing hypotheses and confidence intervals. Another approach is Bayesian inference. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ferreira (1975)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Geweke and Terui (1993)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen and Lee (1995)</ref> provided Bayesian approaches to deal with discontinuous likelihoods in econometrics and nonlinear timeseries models. Our proposed method, using more updated tools, directly models price thresholds in choice models in a general way and conducts coherent statistical inference on them under a small-sample situation. The advantage of our approach is that it avoids such specification search and can accommodate heterogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Application to Scanner</head><p>Panel Data 3.1. Data, Variables, and Model Specification Data and Variables. Video Research Inc., Japan, supplied scanner panel data for the instant-coffee category. In all, 2,840 records for 197 panels during 1990-1992 were available. We assume that five national brands existed in the market during the tracking period. We deal with five primary brands in the market: A, B, C, D, and E. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides descriptive information about the data. Brand B has the maximum share-over 48.03%; the minimum shareapproximately 5.74%-is for brand E. We rescale all prices as yen/100g to equalize quantitative differences for each package of the five brands.</p><p>Variables included in the analysis are:</p><p>• Explanatory Variables: X = [Constant Price Display Feature Brand Loyalty], where Price is the log(price); Display and Feature are binary values; and Brand Loyalty is a smoothing variable over past purchases proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref> as GL jht = GL jht + 1 − I jh t−1 , where a grid search <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Keane 1997</ref>) is applied to fix the smoothing parameter as 0.75 based on the criterion of minimum marginal likelihood.</p><p>• Household Specific Variables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Z r = [Constant Dprone Pfreq ARP BL],</formula><p>where Dprone is the deal proneness defined as the proportion of purchase (of any five brands) made on promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bucklin and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gupta 1992, Han et al. 2001)</ref>; Pfreq is the shopping frequency (three categories; H 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalyanaram and Little 1994:</ref> shopping frequency is a factor to affect the price thresholds); ARP represents the measure of average reference-price level as defined by ARP h = m j=1 T h t=1 log RP jht /T h /m; and BL represents the brand loyalty measure defined as BL h = max j T h t=1 GL jht /T h , both of which are used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalyanaram and Little (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Han et al.

(1997)</ref>, we employ a brand-specific reference price. We also consider four kinds of reference prices of two categories: memorybased and stimulus-based. That is,</p><p>(1) Memory-based as (A) RP jht = P jh t−1 , the price at its last purchase and (B) RP jht = RP jh t−1 + 1 − • P jh t−1 , the smoothed price over previous purchases;</p><p>(2) Stimulus-based as (C) RP jht = P kht , where k means the brand at the last purchase, and (D) RP jht = P rht , where r indicates the price of a brand chosen randomly at the time of purchase.</p><p>Model Specification. We consider three models for comparison with other candidates: (i) aggregate (homogeneous) reference-price Probit model without a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Winer 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Mayhew and Winer 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Putler 1992</ref>); (ii) two regimes' heterogeneous reference price Probit model without a threshold <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al. 1999, Bell and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lattin 2000)</ref>; and our proposed (iii) three-regime heterogeneous reference-price Probit model with thresholds. With four types of reference prices for each model above, summing to 12 models are considered for comparison.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> describes logs of marginal likelihood for model comparison. The model (C)(iii): stimulus-based RP(C) three regime heterogeneous Probit with thresholds is most supported by marginal likelihood criterion. Consequently, some evidence supports the hypothesis of price-threshold existence that was discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalyanaram and Little (1994)</ref> even by using the models incorporating heterogeneous consumers. The summary statistics of parameter estimates for that model are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Reference Effects, Loss Aversion, and</head><p>Price Thresholds Our analysis indicates the presence of asymmetric reference effects, loss aversion, and heterogeneity. This finding is different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref> where asymmetric effects were negligible when heterogeneity and price thresholds were incorporated into the model.</p><p>Corresponding to each type of RP, (A)-(D), we have four sets of models: (A)(i), (A)(ii), (A)(iii) through (D)(i), (D)(ii), (D)(iii). Based on the most supported RP of (C), price-response estimates at the aggregated level show some loss aversion because, in the case of (C)(iii), we have the estimate of regime (g)-gainwhich is smaller than that of regime (l)-loss-as (gain: −3 142, loss: −4 518). The same applies to the model (i) (gain: −4 251, loss: −7 021) and (ii) (gain: −1 637, loss: −2 622). We further observe the following: (i) aggregate (homogeneous) Probit without a threshold shows loss aversion most clearly at the aggregated level; (ii) two-regime heterogeneous Probit without a threshold is the most vague; and (iii) our proposed three-regime heterogeneous Probit with thresholds yields performance between (i) and (ii).</p><p>We found the presence of asymmetric reference effects and loss aversion after price thresholds were incorporated into the model for this data set. This observation is robust relative to other types of reference price, except for (A)(ii), (B)(ii), and (B)(iii).</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr">Bell and Lattin (2000, p. 190</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we present intuitive reasoning for our results. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref> discuss the relation between models (i) and (ii) relative to loss aversion: model (i) has steeper slopes in the loss regime ( is in the gain regime. Therefore, loss aversion would decrease or disappear if heterogeneity were incorporated into the model.</p><p>Next, we examine the relation between models (ii) and (iii). The response functions assumed in each model are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>; we note that the response function of model (ii), corresponding to the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref>, has two regimes without price thresholds. Two response functions are kinked at the zero of sticker shock. Our model (iii), however, has three regimes. We suppose that the true response function has LPA (insensitive range) limited by the price thresholds, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and that the data are observed along with three lines.</p><p>If we fit only two response functions, as employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref>, to data over positive and negative sides of sticker-shock domain separately, the fitted slopes ( g BL l BL will be less steep than the slopes g l of the three-regime model in the gain-and-loss regimes. That is, g BL &lt; g , l BL &lt; l because the fitted slopes are calculated so as to catch up with the data inside LPA, to which a flatter line is applied by definition. For that reason, a model with price thresholds is likely to be more responsive than a model without a threshold for both loss and gain regimes. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents empirical evidence to support this conjecture, which is robust with respect to the choice of reference price.</p><p>On the other hand, that discussion indicates no tendency for loss aversion between models with and without thresholds. However, relying on <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref>, it would be likely for g − l (we define it as the degree of loss aversion) to be positive in most cases because we are trying to model individual consumers' responses. In fact, we used our data to calculate the posterior probability Pr Gain − Loss data at the aggregated level for models (i), (ii), and (iii). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> displays the posterior density of the difference Gain − Loss . The distributions agree with Prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kahneman and Tversky 1979)</ref>, and the degree of loss aversion is strongest for model (i) in the sense that the posterior probability of loss aversion Pr Gain − Loss &gt; 0 data is largest; it is weakest for model (ii). Model (iii) is located between them. The relation between (i) and (ii) is consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bell and Lattin (2000)</ref>. The relation between (ii) and (iii) implies that the degree of loss The relationship between household-specific variables and their market-response parameters was significantly estimated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>This study introduced a three-regime piecewise-linear stochastic utility function with two price thresholds, and proposed a class of brand-choice modelthreshold Probit model-under a framework of a continuous mixture modeling for heterogeneous consumers. Price thresholds generate unconventional discontinuous likelihood functions in the analysis, and they create difficulties in estimation. However, our method directly models thresholds for choice models in a general manner, and coherent statistical inference on the thresholds can be done particularly when the number of samples is scarce. Our empirical application, as far as our data set is concerned, shows that our proposed model is superior to a conventional linear-utility-based Probit model without price thresholds as well as aggregate Probit models; the reference effect and loss aversion are observed after price thresholds are incorporated into a heterogeneous price-response model, but that loss aversion is attenuated then by an aggregate (homogeneous) model without price thresholds. Moreover, through hierarchical modeling, we investigated explanatory factors of heterogeneous price thresholds. Some are consistent with previous studies that assumed consumer homogeneity.</p><p>Individual heterogeneity makes it possible to design a customized strategy, which has been demanded recently as we can see, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gal-Or and Gal-Or (2005)</ref> for customized advertising. As an application of our model, we explored a possibility of customized pricing strategy based on the knowledge of price thresholds for respective households. Our limited simulation study showed that customized pricing could yield greater profits than flat pricing, and optimal pricing levels are provided at the lower price thresholds for discounting, and at the upper price thresholds for a price hike. However, this is not reported here to save space.</p><p>Our analysis can be generalized further in several aspects. For example, heterogeneous modeling could be applied to smoothing parameters of the reference price derived from exponentially weighted past prices. Moreover, it can be extended to accommodate the dynamic relation on a utility function, for example, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Leichty et al. (2005)</ref> recently proposed. Together with a comprehensive discussion of customized pricing mentioned above, we leave these problems for future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Model for Price Thresholds and Market Responses</figDesc></figure>
