<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Ever since the availability of scanner panel data, researchers in marketing have been concerned with jointly modeling the three important decisions facing a consumer of a frequently purchased packaged good: whether to buy in the category (incidence), which brand to buy (choice), and how much of the chosen brand to buy (quantity). Almost all the prior literature that has modeled these three decisions simultaneously from an underlying utility maximizing framework has used Hanemann's framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hanemann 1984)</ref>; relevant marketing papers are <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chintagunta (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arora et al. (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al. (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Song and Chintagunta (2007)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides further details on each of these papers.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Hanemann framework suffers from a widely acknowledged and important limitation that restricts its applicability to a number of problems. For many commonly used error distributions, the price elasticities related to the quantity decision are restricted to be equal to (or very close to) "one" in magnitude, regardless of brand, consumer, or category. In the context of those categories in which consumers make all three purchase decisions, restricted quantity elasticity estimates of this kind clearly hinder any empirical examination or policy analysis of a firm's decisions related to pricing or price promotions. For instance, consider a muchstudied research question-namely, deciding which categories or brands a retailer should promote. An accurate estimate of quantity elasticities is clearly central to answering this question because a common response to promotions is purchase acceleration and stockpiling, the magnitudes of which are impossible to assess if one restricts quantity elasticities. Similarly, suppose one wanted to perform counterfactuals such as examining the change in profits or the change in consumer welfare if a product were deleted from a product line or if the retailer were to change his pricing policies. One needs an appropriate structural model that models all three purchase decisions, and one needs the model to provide correct estimates of quantity elasticity.</p><p>This brings us directly to the focus of this paper: examining why Hanemann's framework suffers from this restriction and suggesting ways to overcome it. Before we proceed, it is important to clarify that obtaining elasticities different from −1 is not an end in itself and is certainly not the aim of this paper. The intention is to get as close to the "true" quantity elasticities as possible. To do this, it is important to identify restrictions that might lead to biased estimates. We therefore attack the problem in the following three logical steps. In the first step we point out three restrictions imposed by assumptions on the joint distribution of the brand-specific econometrician's errors 1 in forcing quantity elasticity to be close to one in magnitude. Specifically, we discuss the nature of these restrictions in the absence of unobserved heterogeneity and show that the three restrictions hold true when the econometrician's errors are independent and identically distributed (IID) extreme valued, logistic or generalized extreme value (GEV) distributed (an assumption used in all five prior papers based on Hanemann's framework). In the second step, we show how the three restrictions on the quantity elasticities can be alleviated at the population level by considering unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. Specifically, having understood the nature of the restrictions imposed by the econometrician's errors in the first step, we use this knowledge to understand the properties required of the specification of unobserved heterogeneity that would help relax these restrictions. This, in turn, allows us to hypothesize on the extent to which different specifications of unobserved heterogeneity popularly used in prior literature (namely, normal random, finite mixture, and mixture normal heterogeneity) would serve as suitable specifications that would satisfy the properties and thereby relax the three restrictions. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Finally, in the third step, we empirically demonstrate the nature of the restrictions imposed by the distributional assumptions of the econometrician's errors on the quantity elasticities, and we test our hypotheses on the extent to which each restriction gets relaxed at the population level over different specifications of unobserved heterogeneity. We do so using scanner panel data in the yogurt category.</p><p>Our findings can be simply stated. First, the specification of unobserved heterogeneity crucially influences estimates of quantity elasticities. Thus, it is not enough to merely account for unobserved heterogeneity because different specifications relax the restrictions to differing extents. For example, two popular specifications, the finite mixture and the normal, do not do a good job of relaxing restrictions. This brings us to the second finding: the mixture normal specification of heterogeneity does the best job of relaxing the restrictions and, hence, of obtaining the most accurate estimates of quantity elasticities.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, we formally elucidate three restrictions imposed by the choice of the distribution of the errors on the estimates of the quantity elasticities. In §3, we show how the restrictions can be relaxed at the population level by considering unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. This is followed by §4, where we empirically demonstrate the restrictions on the quantity elasticities and the relative efficacy of different specifications of unobserved heterogeneity in relaxing the restrictions. In §5, we discuss the substantive implications of our empirical findings. Section 6 concludes with limitations and suggestions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model</head><p>In §2.1, we provide the specifications of the incidence, quantity, and brand choice decisions in Hanemann's framework. Using these specifications, in §2.2 we derive the expressions for the price elasticities related to the quantity decision. With this in place, in §2.3 we detail the restrictions on quantity elasticities implied by the choice of the distribution of the econometrician's errors. Note that the discussion on the restrictions is based on the assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. It is important to emphasize, however, that the results we derive are not restricted to the no-heterogeneity case. Considering the no-heterogeneity case, however, helps us gain a clearer intuition into the nature of the restrictions and provides a natural segue to §3, where we discuss ways to relax the restrictions by considering unobserved heterogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Specifications of the Incidence, Choice, and</head><p>Quantity Decisions We start by outlining the theoretical specification of the incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity model based on the joint utility maximization framework laid out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hanemann (1984)</ref>. Because much of this treatment is standard and has been used in the prior marketing papers listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, we provide only key details here. Consider the case where there are m = 1 M brands in the product category of interest. Let p m be the unit price and m be the consumer's quality index of brand m. Furthermore, let z be the quality index of the composite commodity and p z be its unit price, which is taken as a numeraire. Finally, let y be the total basket expenditure of the consumer on the given trip. Given these covariates, the consumer's utility maximization problem can be characterized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">max q m M m=1 u M m=1 m q m z z subject to M m=1 p m q m + p z z = y q z &gt; 0 q m ≥ 0 for m = 1 M (1a)</formula><p>where u is the direct utility, and q m and q z are the quantities of brand m and of the composite commodity, respectively. The linearity of the first argument in the utility in (1a) implies that at most one brand can be purchased in the category, namely, the one with the lowest quality-adjusted price, p m / m , amongst all m = 1 M brands in the category. To get the functional form specifications of the purchase decisions, we choose the homothetic translog (HTL) specification of the indirect utility (this is the most widely used specification in the five prior papers) that corresponds to the direct utility in (1a) between the composite commodity z and the chosen brand k. This is given as </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">HT L ≡ ln y − a ln p k k − 1 − a ln p z z + 1 2 b 11 ln p k k 2 + 1 2 b 22 ln p z z 2 + b 12 ln p k k ln p z z (<label>1b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">ln m ≡ m H m + m / (2a) ln z ≡ z z (2b)</formula><p>In (2a), the parameter is the inverse of the consumer's quality sensitivity in the category and is restricted to be positive, and H m is a vector of explanatory variables that include the brand dummies, presence of promotions, state dependence, and inventory for the category. Finally, m is a vector of parameters that represent the consumer's sensitivity toward the explanatory variables, and m is a random variable that is IID across all households and purchase occasions. In (2b), z is a random aggregate shock that is independent of the errors m in (2a), and z is the parameter by which the aggregate shock is scaled.</p><p>Based on the HTL specification and the functional forms of the quality indices, we make the transformations V m ≡ m H m − ln p m / m ≡ m − z z / , and ≡ a/b 11 to get the stochastic specifications of the incidence, brand choice, and quantity decisions as follows:</p><p>Purchase Incidence Decision. A purchase will be made in the category (that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I = 1) if max m=1 M V m + m &gt; (3)</formula><p>Brand Choice Decision. Conditional on purchase in the category (that is, I = 1), brand k will be chosen (that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d k = 1) if V k + k ≥ V m + m ∀ m = 1 M (4)</formula><p>Budget Share/Purchase Quantity Decision. Conditional on purchase in the category and choice of brand k (that is, I = 1 and d k = 1), the budget share of brand k is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">s = b 11 V k + k − (5)</formula><p>where the purchase quantity of brand k is related to its budget share as q k ≡ ys/p k (for tractability reasons, we generally work with the budget share of a brand instead of its purchase quantity; because one is easily obtained from the other, this choice has no material consequences). Notice that the stochastic specifications of all three decisions in (3), (4), and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) are summarized in terms of two important elements: "V m + m " and " ." These are explained as follows.</p><p>The first element V m + m can be interpreted as the consumer's subutility of brand m, with V m as the deterministic part and m as the stochastic part. The deterministic part V m is a function of the brand's price p m and the explanatory variables in its quality index H m . The stochastic part m , which we henceforth refer to as the econometrician's error, is, in turn, a function of the error m and the aggregate shock z . The interpretation of V m + m as brand m's subutility follows from the fact that in all three decisions, the impact of the market mix variables of any brand m only comes through its subutility. Finally, the second element can be interpreted as the consumer's threshold utility for purchase in the category. This interpretation follows from the purchase incidence decision in (3)-for a purchase to be made in the category, the subutility for at least one brand has to be greater than .</p><p>Given the stochastic specifications of the three decisions, we turn next to the derivation of the price elasticities for the purchase quantity/budget share decision of a brand conditional on its purchase. Note that the only stochastic terms in the three decisions in  <ref type="table">1</ref>. Essentially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al. (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Song and Chintagunta (2007)</ref> assumed z = 1/ and the errors m z to be IID extreme valued (EV) distributed, which resulted in a logistic distribution for m M m=1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chintagunta (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arora et al. (1998)</ref> assumed z = 0 and the errors m to be IID EV distributed, which resulted in an IID EV distribution for m M m=1 . Because our main objective is to show how the choice of the joint distribution of the econometrician's errors can restrict the price elasticities related to the purchase quantity decision (or simply the quantity elasticities), we depart from prior literature and do not derive the elasticities using a specific functional form of the joint distribution of these errors. Instead, we start in §2.2 by deriving the specifications of the quantity elasticities related to the purchase quantity decision using a general form for the joint distribution function of the errors F m M m=1 . Based on that, in §2.3, we discuss three restrictive properties of the joint distribution function that would restrict the estimates of the quantity elasticities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Specifications of Elasticities Related to the</head><p>Purchase Quantity/Budget Share Decision Using the specifications of the three decisions in (3), (4), and (5), we get the distribution of the budget share of brand k conditional on its choice and purchase in the category as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G k s d k = 1 I = 1 = Pr V k + k ≤ + s/b 11 V k + k ≥ V m + m ∀ m = 1 M max m=1 M V m + m &gt; (6)</formula><p>Making the transformation = V k + k in (6), the distribution of the conditional budget share can be written in terms of the general form of the joint distribution of the errors,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F m M m=1 as G k s d k = 1 I = 1 = 1 − +s/b 11 F k − V m M m=1 d F k − V m M m=1 d</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F k = F k (7)</formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), we get the expected value of the conditional budget share of brand k as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E s d k = 1 I = 1 = s s G k s d k = 1 I = 1 s ds = 1 b 11 s sF k + s/b 11 − V m M m=1 ds F k − V m M m=1 d (8)</formula><p>which yields the price elasticity of the expected conditional budget share (or simply the conditional budget share elasticity) of brand k as This completes the specifications of the conditional budget share/quantity elasticities. We now turn to the central focus of this section, namely, a discussion of how the choice of the functional form of the distribution of the errors can restrict the estimates of the quantity elasticities. Before we do so, there are two important points we would like to make. First, although we discuss the impact of the distributional assumptions of the errors on quantity elasticities for a particular demand system, one based on HTL indirect utility, our results can be generalized to all demand systems (the relevant proofs for a general demand system are given in §4 of the electronic companion to this paper, available as part of the online version that can be found at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org). Second, we assume that the purchase quantity is continuous. This is in keeping with most of the prior literature based on Hanemann's framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chiang 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Chintagunta 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Nair et al. 2005</ref>). More importantly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al. (2005)</ref> empirically compared the predictions of the continuous quantity assumption with those of the discrete quantity approximation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arora et al. (1998)</ref>. They found the results to be very similar across the two, implying that the continuous quantity assumption is fairly robust.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">bs k = ln E s d k = 1 I = 1 ln p k (<label>9</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Restrictions Imposed by the Specification of</head><formula xml:id="formula_11">F m M m=1</formula><p>on Quantity Elasticities We discuss three restrictions that can be imposed by the specification of the distribution function of the econometrician's errors on the quantity elasticities given in (10). We do so in the following two lemmas, where Lemma 1 deals with the first restriction and Lemma 2 deals with the other two restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">The First Restriction.</head><p>Lemma 1. If the joint distribution function of the errors F m M m=1 is such that for any brand k, the function L k x given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L k x ≡ Pr V k + k ≤ x V k + k ≥ V m + m ∀ m = 1 M max m=1 M V m + m &gt; (11)</formula><p>is identical across all brands, that is, L k x ≡ L j x ∀ j k ∈ 1 M , then the specifications of the expected values of the conditional budget shares (Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)) will also be identical across all brands; i.e., E s d k = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">I = 1 ≡ E s d j = 1 I = 1 ∀ j k ∈ 1 M .</formula><p>Proof. See §2 of the electronic companion. An Outline of a Proof of Lemma 1. Notice that the distribution function of the conditional budget share of brand k (G k s d k = 1 I = 1) in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)) is a simple convolution of L k x , given in Equation (11). In other words, if we replace "x" in the expression for L k x in Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) with " + s/b 11 ," we get the distribution function of the conditional budget share of brand k as given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). Now if L k x is identical across all brands k = 1 M, it implies that the distribution of the conditional budget share in (6) will also be identical across all brands. This would, in turn, imply that the expected values of the conditional budget shares will be identical across all brands; that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E s d k = 1 I = 1 ≡ E s d j = 1 I = 1 ∀ j k ∈ 1 M .</formula><p>Corollary. The condition stated in Lemma 1 holds true when the errors m M m=1 follow a GEV, an IID EV, or a logistic distribution.</p><p>Proof. See §2 of the electronic companion. Implication of Lemma 1. If the specifications of the expected values of the conditional budget shares of all brands are identical, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E s d k = 1 I = 1 ≡ E s d j = 1 I = 1 ∀ j k ∈ 1 M ,</formula><p>the conditional budget share elasticities of all brands j = 1 M with respect to the price of brand k will also be identical; that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ln E s d k = 1 I = 1 ln p k ≡ ln E s d j = 1 I = 1 ln p k ∀ j k ∈ 1 M (12)</formula><p>The above result follows from the fact that because E s d k = 1 I = 1 ≡ E s d j = 1 I = 1 is an identity, differentiating both sides with respect to ln p k will preserve the identity. Before discussing the implication of (12), it is useful to clarify what the right-hand side (RHS) in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), which is the conditional budget share elasticity of brand j with respect to the price of another brand k = j, really captures. This elasticity captures the impact of brand k's price on a consumer's budget share decision (i.e., her allocation of the total shopping expenditure between the chosen brand j and the composite commodity, conditional on the fact that she has chosen to purchase brand j over brand k). Thus this elasticity refers only to consumers who have decided to purchase brand j and not brand k in the category. Intuitively, we would expect the budget share decision of buyers of brand j to not be affected by changes in the price of brand k because they do not buy brand k. Thus we would expect the RHS in Equation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) to be close to zero. However, note that as per the identity in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), this implies that the left-hand side (LHS), which represents the conditional budget share elasticity of brand k with respect to its own price, would be biased toward zero. Because the quantity elasticity of the chosen brand k with respect to its own price is nothing but the conditional budget share elasticity of the chosen brand k with respect to its own price minus one (Equation ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)), this implies that the quantity elasticity of brand k would be biased toward −1. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Implication of the Corollary. The corollary implies that if there is no unobserved heterogeneity and if we use a GEV, IID EV, or logistic distribution for the errors, then the quantity elasticities of all brands will be biased toward −1. Linking this to prior literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang (1991)</ref> employed a logistic distribution and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chintagunta (1993)</ref> employed an IID EV distribution for the econometrician's errors (neither paper considered unobserved parameter heterogeneity in the quantity choice decision); both reported quantity elasticities close to −1. However, note that if the errors are IID normal, then the condition in Lemma 1 does not hold true. Thus, the quantity elasticities will not suffer from the first restriction when the errors are normally distributed. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">The Second and Third Restrictions.</head><p>Lemma 2. The magnitude and sign of the deviation of the quantity elasticity of any brand k from "−1" depend, respectively, on the magnitude and sign of the slope of the function M k x , given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">M k x ≡ − x F kk − V m M m=1 d x F k − V m M m=1 d (13)</formula><p>for values of x &gt; (recall that F k = F / k , F kk = 2 F / 2 k , and is the threshold utility of the consumer in the category). In particular, (a) If the joint distribution of the errors F m M m=1 is such that M k x / x &gt; 0 for all x &gt; , then the quantity elasticity of brand k will always be greater than one in magnitude; i.e., pq k &gt; 1.

Thus, as per part (b) of Lemma 2, we will get the quantity elasticities for all brands to be close to one in magnitude; i.e., pq k ≈ 1.</p><p>Proof. See §2 of the electronic companion. An Outline of a Proof of Lemma 2: Consider the survivor function of the distribution of the conditional budget share of brand k, k , which is related to the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the conditional budget share of brand k as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">k ≡ 1 − G k s d k = 1 I = 1 (14)</formula><p>Next, consider the case where ln k / ln p k &lt; 0 for all values of the price of brand k, p k , and the share of brand k. This inequality implies that ln G k / ln p k &gt; 0.</p><p>As a result, the cdf of the share of brand k at a higher value of p k will be first-order stochastically dominated by the cdf of the share of brand k at a lower value of p k . In other words, as the price of brand k increases, the probability mass in the cdf of the budget share of brand k moves toward zero, which in turn implies that the expected value of s at a higher value of p k will be smaller than that at a lower value of p k . As a result, we will get the conditional budget share elasticity of brand k to be negative and, consequently, the quantity elasticity of brand k to be greater than one in magnitude (since pq k = bs k − 1). In a similar vein, we can see that if ln k / ln p k &gt; 0, we would get the quantity elasticity of brand k to be less than one in magnitude; and if ln k / ln p k ≈ 0, we would get the quantity elasticity of brand k to be close to one in magnitude.</p><p>Next, using the specification of G k s d k = 1 I = 1) given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), we get the specification of ln k / ln p k in terms of the function M k as given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ln k / ln p k = M k − M k + s/b 11 (15)</formula><p>Consider the RHS of Equation ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), which is</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">M k − M k + s/b 11 .

Thus, following the line of argument given before, we will get the quantity elasticity of brand k to be close to one in magnitude.</p><p>This completes the sketch of a proof for Lemma 2. Note that Lemma 2 thus implies two restrictions on the estimates of the conditional budget share/quantity elasticities. The first restriction, implied by part (a) of Lemma 2 (which we henceforth refer to as R2a), relates the sign of M k x / x for x &gt; to whether the quantity elasticity of brand k will be less than or greater than one in magnitude. The second restriction, implied by part (b) of Lemma 2 (which we henceforth refer to as R2b), relates the magnitude of M k / x for x &gt; to whether the quantity elasticity of brand k will be close to one in magnitude. Furthermore, the corollaries relate the two restrictions to the specific distributions of the econometrician's errors. Specifically, if these errors are IID EV/GEV/logistic distributed, then the quantity elasticities will suffer from both R2a and R2b. If the errors are independent normal, then the quantity elasticities will only suffer from R2a.</p><p>Given the above intuitive discussion, it is useful to delve deeper into the statistical properties of the distribution of the errors that result in the restrictions implied by Lemma 2. To do this, it helps to examine the term M k / x in the region x &gt; . Consider this for the case when there is only one brand k in the category. (Note that this is a salient difference between the restrictions implied by Lemma 2 and the restriction implied by Lemma 1. The restriction implied by Lemma 1 only holds when the total number of brands in the category is greater than one. However, the restrictions implied by Lemma 2 hold even if there is just one brand in the category.) In such a case, after making the substitution k = x − V k , the slope of the function M k x given in (13) simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">M k x x ≡ k F k k 1 − F k (16a)</formula><p>and the space spanned by the condition x &gt; simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">k &gt; − V k (16b)</formula><p>where F is the distribution function of the econometrician's error in brand k's subutility, k , and F k is its density. Now, notice the RHS of (16a) is simply the slope of the hazard function of k . Moreover, the space spanned by the condition in (16b) is nothing but the region in which a purchase is made in the category, which can be further couched in terms of the purchase incidence probability in the category as 5 k &gt; F −1 1 − Pr I = 1 . Thus, the slope of M k x in the region x &gt; can be intuitively interpreted as the slope of the hazard function of the error k in the region in which a purchase is made in the category; i.e., k &gt; F −1 1− Pr I = 1 .</p><p>Based on this interpretation, the restriction R2a implied by part (a) of Lemma 2 can be interpreted as follows: If the hazard function of the econometrician's error in brand k's subutility is increasing in the region in which the category is purchased, then the quantity elasticity of brand k will be greater than one in magnitude. Given this interpretation, an intuitive explanation of Corollary 1 follows immediately. Note that if k is either EV, logistic, or normally distributed, then its hazard function is always increasing. Thus, if we assume the errors m M m=1 to be EV, logistic, or normally distributed, we will always restrict the quantity elasticities to be greater than one in magnitude.</p><p>The restriction R2b implied by part (b) of Lemma 2 can similarly be interpreted as follows: For a given purchase incidence probability in the category Pr I = 1 , if the magnitude of the hazard function of the econometrician's error k for values of k &gt; F −1 1 − Pr I = 1 is small, then the quantity elasticity of brand k will be close to one in magnitude. Next, we use this interpretation to understand why Corollary 2 holds true for EV and logistic errors but not for normal errors. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we plot the slope of the hazard function for EV, normal, and logistic distributions (after normalizing the scale and location parameters across the three distributions) for the single brand case. Observe in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> that for high values of k (or low values of the purchase incidence probability), the value of the slope of the hazard function becomes very small for EV and logistic distributions. For instance, if we consider Pr I = 1 = 0 15 as in the earlier simulation exercise, we can see that for values of k &gt; F −1 1 − 0 15 (which is approximately "1.0" for all three distributions), the slopes of the hazard functions for EV and logistic distributions become small. However, that is not the case for the normal random errors. Thus as per the interpretation of part (b) of Lemma 2, it follows that if the purchase incidence probability in the category is low (which it typically is for most data sets), then assuming EV or logistic distributions for EV distribution the econometrician's errors will yield values of quantity elasticities close to one in magnitude. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the discussion above, and §3 discusses how to relax these restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Relaxing the Three Restrictions on Quantity Elasticities</head><p>One can relax the three restrictions R1, R2a, and R2b in two possible ways. The first alternative is to use a distribution for the errors that does not suffer from the three restrictions, i.e., a distribution other than IID EV, GEV, independent normal, or logistic. The only distribution for the errors (which has a support from − to + ) that comes to mind is the multivariate normal distribution. Although an empirical question, it is not clear that a multivariate normal distribution for the errors will relax restriction R2a. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The second alternative, which we focus on, is to relax the three restrictions on the quantity elasticities at the population level by considering unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters in the brand subutilities.</p><p>We start in §3.1 by explaining how the three restrictions discussed so far in the absence of unobserved <ref type="bibr">6</ref> This argument mirrors that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al. (2005)</ref>, who also find that when the purchase incidence probability is low, using a logistic distribution restricts the purchase quantity elasticities to be close to one in magnitude. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> It is difficult to formally prove the existence of restriction R2a for the general case of M + 1 alternatives when the econometrician's errors are multivariate normally distributed. However, in the electronic companion, we show a formal proof for a simple case of three alternatives (two brands + the no purchase option) when the errors are bivariate normally distributed. We show that in such a case, the purchase quantity elasticity of at least one brand will always be greater than one in magnitude, implying that R2a will not be relaxed. If the purchase incidence probability is low, the slope of the hazard function for these distributions is small, which implies that the quantity elasticities of all brands will be close to one in magnitude IID EV, GEV, logistic heterogeneity can be extended to the case when we have unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters in the subutilities of brands. Given this, in § §3.2 and 3.3, we discuss the properties that are required of a specification of unobserved heterogeneity that will help relax each of the three restrictions. Finally, in §3.4, we hypothesize on the extent to which different specifications of unobserved heterogeneity used in prior marketing literature would satisfy the properties needed to relax the restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Understanding the Restrictions in the Presence of Unobserved Heterogeneity</head><p>To see how the three restrictions can be extended to the unobserved heterogeneity case, it first helps to note the differences in the constituents of the stochastic terms in the subutilities of brands between the "no unobserved heterogeneity case" and the "unobserved heterogeneity case." If there is no heterogeneity, recall that the subutility of any brand m is given as V m + m , where the deterministic part of brand m's subutility is V m , and the error in any brand m's subutility consists of only the econometrician's error, m . However, once we consider unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters m in the subutilities of brands, the subutility of any brand m will be given as V m + m , in which the deterministic part of brand m's subutility is V m (which is the expected value of the deterministic part of the subutility of brand m, V m , after taking out the errors due to unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters), and the error in brand m's subutility m will consist of not only the econometrician's error m but also the error resulting from the unobserved heterogeneity (we refer to the composite of these two errors, in the unobserved heterogeneity case as the overall stochastic term m ).</p><p>Note that the conditions stated in Lemmas 1 and 2 only deal with the statistical properties of the distribution of the errors in the subutilities of the brands. Now, in the "no-heterogeneity case," to see if the three restrictions hold true, we only need to check whether the statistical properties of the distribution of the econometrician's errors m M m=1 satisfy the conditions stated in Lemmas 1 and 2 (which is what we did in §2). On the other hand, in the presence of heterogeneity, the extent to which the three restrictions hold true at the population level depends on the extent to which the statistical properties of the distribution of the overall stochastic terms m M m=1 satisfy the conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2. Thus, in summary, in the presence of heterogeneity the restrictions discussed in §2 remain as they are, except that the conditions are not on the distribution of the econometrician's errors but on the overall stochastic term. 8</p></div>

Given the discussion above, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Note that the proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2 for the heterogeneity case follow exactly the same line of reasoning as the proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2 given in §2.3 for the no-heterogeneity case. As pointed out, the no-heterogeneity case and the heterogeneity case only differ vis-à-vis the specifications of the subutilities of brands. Thus, the proofs of lemmas in the heterogeneity case remain as they are in the no-heterogeneity case, expect that in the proofs, (i) the deterministic part of the subutility of any brand m, V m , is replaced by V m , and (ii) the joint distribution of the econometrician's errors m is replaced by the joint distribution of the overall stochastic terms m .</p><p>it is easy to see that even if the joint distribution of the econometrician's errors m M m=1 satisfies the condition in Lemma 1, it does not imply that the joint distribution of the overall stochastic terms m M m=1 will also satisfy the condition in Lemma 1.</p><p>Having said that, it is important to note that the extent to which R1 gets relaxed at the population level depends on one crucial property, which is the extent to which the specification of the unobserved heterogeneity imposed by the analyst can adequately recover the true heterogeneity in the data. Thus, if the specification of the unobserved heterogeneity is not able to capture the true heterogeneity in the data (and, as a result, underestimates it), then the statistical properties of the overall stochastic term will be dictated more by the properties of the econometrician's error k than by the error due to heterogeneity; in that case, adding heterogeneity will not help to fully relax R1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Relaxing Restrictions R2a and R2b</head><p>Similar to Lemma 1, the restrictions R2a and R2b as implied by Lemma 2 can be extended to the heterogeneity case as follows. If the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term m in the subutility of brand m is restricted to be positive (negative), then the quantity elasticity of brand m will be greater than one (less than one) in magnitude; and if the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term m is close to zero in magnitude in the region in which a purchase is made in the category, then the quantity elasticity of brand m will be close to one in magnitude. Given this extension, it is easy to see that the extent to which the two restrictions implied by Lemma 2 get relaxed depends on the extent to which the distribution of the overall stochastic term in the brand subutilities is flexible enough to allow for the slope of its hazard function to take both positive and negative values (and thereby relax R2a) over a wide range of magnitudes (and thereby relax R2b). Clearly, even if the distribution of the econometrician's errors m satisfies the condition in Lemma 2, it does not imply that the joint distribution of the overall stochastic term m will also satisfy the condition in Lemma 2.</p><p>To sum, the extent to which R2a and R2b get relaxed depends on two factors. First, as in the case of R1, it is important that the specification of unobserved heterogeneity be able to recover the true heterogeneity in the data adequately. Second, the extent to which R2a and R2b get relaxed depends on how flexible the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity is in terms of the slope of its hazard function; the greater the flexibility, the more likely that the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term can take a wide range of positive or negative values (and, thereby, relax R2a and R2b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Relative Efficacy of Different Specifications of Unobserved Parameter Heterogeneity in</head><p>Relaxing the Restrictions Based on prior literature, there are three choices of unobserved heterogeneity distribution that come to mind readily as candidates for relaxing the three restrictions on the quantity elasticities at the population level. These are (a) normal random heterogeneity, (b) finite mixture heterogeneity (latent class segmentation), and (c) mixture normal random heterogeneity.</p><p>3.4.1. Normal Random Specification. In this specification, we consider the parameters m in the deterministic part of the subutility of brand m, V m , to be normally distributed, and the parameter (which is restricted to be positive as per the model specification) to be log normally distributed across the consumer population. Note that introducing the log normal distribution over is a departure from previously used normal random specifications of heterogeneity. This is because the log normal distribution has a flexible hazard function whose slope is neither strictly positive nor strictly negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Lancaster 1992)</ref>. This gives more flexibility to the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term, letting it take positive or negative values and, hence, potentially overcoming R2a. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Having said that, it remains to be empirically seen whether using such a specification of unobserved heterogeneity would satisfy the two properties needed to relax the restrictions. Pertaining to the first property, if the true heterogeneity in the data is multimodal, this specification may do a poor job of recovering it. Pertaining to the second property, although this is an empirical question, it is not clear that using a simple fix of assuming log normal heterogeneity over will make the distribution of the overall stochastic term in a brand's subutility flexible enough to enable the slope of its hazard function to take a wide range of positive or negative values and, hence, overcome R2a and R2b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Finite Mixture Specification (Latent Class Segmentation).</head><p>Because this specification is semiparametric, we would it to be flexible enough to enable the slope of the hazard function of the overall <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Note that if we do not consider the log normal heterogeneity over , then the random error in a brand's subutility that results from unobserved heterogeneity on m only will be normally distributed. Because a normal distribution has a strictly increasing hazard function, it will not lend flexibility to the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term. Recall from Table <ref type="table">1</ref> that this was the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al. (2005)</ref>, who considered the normal heterogeneity on m but no unobserved heterogeneity on . As a result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Nair et al.

(1998)</ref>, the finite mixture specification does not capture heterogeneity as well as the normal random specification because it does a poor job of describing tail behavior. Thus, we would expect this specification to satisfy one of the properties needed to relax the restrictions (namely, flexibility), but it remains to be seen empirically whether it does a good job of satisfying the other property (namely, capturing the true heterogeneity in the data adequately).</p><p>3.4.3. Mixture Normal Random Specification. In this specification, for a given segment, the parameters m are assumed to be normally distributed while the parameter is assumed to be log normally distributed across the consumer population. Prior research <ref type="bibr">(Allenby et al. 1998, Rossi and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Allenby 2003)</ref> has shown that the mixture normal specification does an excellent job of capturing the underlying heterogeneity because, with enough components, it can approximate virtually any multivariate density. Furthermore, because the mixture normal specification has a semiparametric component, it would lend flexibility to the slope of its hazard function, which would in turn enable the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term to take a wide range of positive or negative values and, hence, overcome R2a and R2b. Thus we would expect this specification to satisfy both the properties needed for alleviating the three restrictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Design of the Empirical Analysis</head><p>Our objective in this section is to empirically test the extent of relaxation of the restrictions for a given distribution of the econometrician's errors as we move across different specifications of heterogeneity, focusing on an IID EV distribution for the econometrician's errors. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The four IID EV models that we estimate are (i) no heterogeneity (model 1), (ii) normal random heterogeneity (model 2), (iii) finite mixture heterogeneity (model 3), and (iv) mixture normal heterogeneity (model 4). Details of the models estimated are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. The total sample consists of the purchase activities of 150 households over 2 years; the households are chosen such that all have purchased at least once in the yogurt category. The sample consists of 19,516 purchase observations, of which yogurt was purchased on 4,769 occasions. We randomly split the total sample into estimation and hold out samples. The estimation sample consists of 100 households with 13,392 purchase observations and the hold out sample consists of 50 households with 6,124 observations. 4.2.2. Variables. For each purchase observation, we have three sets of dependent variables: (i) an indicator variable representing the purchase incidence in the category, (ii) an M × 1 vector of indictor variables (where M is the total number of brands) representing the brand choice decision conditional on purchase in the category, and (iii) the budget share/purchase quantity of the brand conditional on purchase in the category and brand choice.</p><p>The explanatory variables for each purchase observation are variables that enter the subutilities of the brands. Recall that in the deterministic part of the subutility of a brand m, the explanatory variables in the vector H m impact the preference for brand m and p m is the per unit price of brand m. The variables that we include in H m are (i) brand dummies, (ii) presence of promotions on the brand (that includes features and displays), (iii) brand loyalty, and (iv) inventory of the category. The choice of these variables is driven by prior literature in marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Chintagunta 1993</ref>. Note that the inventory variable, unlike the first three variables, is the same across all brands in the category. Thus, it will only impact the purchase incidence and budget share decisions and not in magnitude. The data thus provide a good test of our method's ability to relax the restrictions. the brand choice decision. In the yogurt category, consumers' consumption rates depend on the inventory at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ailawadi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Neslin 1998, Sun 2005)</ref>; thus, we update the inventories using a flexible consumption rate as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ailawadi and Neslin (1998)</ref>.</p><p>The parameters for each of the four IID EV models are discussed in §5 of the electronic companion. The number of segments for the finite mixture heterogeneity models and the mixture normal heterogeneity models are chosen such that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is minimized. Based on that, we end up with four segments for the finite mixture heterogeneity models and two segments for the mixture normal heterogeneity models. We use the method of simulated maximum likelihood to estimate the following parameters in each model: (i) the parameters in the subutilities of brands m , which are homogenous in model 1 but heterogeneous in models 2-4; and (ii) the parameter b 11 . Note that we cannot separately identify the threshold utility from the brand dummy parameters (the brand intercepts) that enter the subutilities of brands in any of the four models. Thus, we set = 0 and, instead, estimate the brand dummy parameters of all the brands. We will discuss our estimation methodology briefly; further details are provided in §5 of the electronic companion.</p><p>We simultaneously estimate all the parameters by maximizing the joint likelihood of all three purchase decisions. Because our interest lies in accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in all three purchase decisions (especially the quantity decision), we need to integrate out the unobserved heterogeneity over the joint likelihood for all three decisions while estimating the parameters. This lets us account for the impact of unobserved heterogeneity in brand subutilities in the quantity decision, which in turn allows us to use unobserved heterogeneity as a fix to the quantity elasticity problem. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Formally, the dependent variables for each consumer i at occasion t are the incidence decision I i t , the brand choice decision if a purchase has been made in the category,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">d i t ≡ d i mt M m=1</formula><p>, and the budget share decision s i t ≡ s i mt M j=1 . We represent the consumer-specific parameters by 2i and the population-level parameters that capture these consumer-specific parameters by 2 .

As per R1, we should see expected conditional budget shares to be identical across all brands, which would force the own conditional budget share elasticities to be the same as the cross-conditional budget share elasticities. To verify this, we first computed the expected conditional budget shares of all brands at the mean values of the explanatory variables. As expected, they are identical across brands (0.0479 for Nordica, 0.0479 for Yoplait, 0.0479 for private label, 0.0479 for Dannon, and 0.0479 for WBB). The impact of this can be seen from the fact that the cross-conditional budget share elasticities are identical to the own conditional budget share elasticities. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Next, as per R2a, we should see quantity elasticities greater than one in magnitude across all brands. Furthermore, because the purchase incidence probability is low (around 24%), we should also see all quantity elasticities being close to one in magnitude, as per R2b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Model 2-Normal Random Coefficients Un-</head><p>observed Heterogeneity. This model uses a normal random specification for unobserved heterogeneity (with log normal specification of unobserved heterogeneity over the parameter ). Population-level elasticities for model 2 are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Comparing these to the quantity elasticities predicted by model 1 (no unobserved heterogeneity), three points are noteworthy.  First, unlike model 1, the quantity elasticities predicted by model 2 are not as close to −1 (they range from −0 7920 to −1 0627), thus implying that R2b is more relaxed in model 2 than in model 1. Second, unlike model 1, the quantity elasticities predicted by model 2 are less than one in magnitude for four out of the five brands, which implies that restriction R2a is also more relaxed in model 2 than in model 1. Third, unlike model 1, the expected conditional budget shares calculated at the mean values of the explanatory variables in model 2 are different across all brands (they are 0.0397 for Nordica, 0.0474 for Yoplait, 0.0427 for private label, 0.0495 for Dannon, and 0.0406 for WBB), thus implying that R1 is relaxed compared to model 1.</p><p>Thus, we see that by comparison with the noheterogeneity case (model 1), all three restrictions seem to get relaxed for the normal random heterogeneity model (model 2). The reasons for this follow from our hypotheses in §3.3 regarding the extent to which the normal random heterogeneity satisfies the two properties needed to relax the restrictions. In terms of the first property, the normal random heterogeneity does a good job of capturing the actual heterogeneity in the data, which can be inferred by observing a drastic difference in the BIC of model 2 (BIC = 1807 2) compared to model 1 (BIC = 2786 9). In terms of the second property, assuming log normal heterogeneity over the parameter gives model 2 some degree of flexibility to allow the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term to take negative values.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Comparing these to the quantity elasticities predicted by model 1 (no unobserved heterogeneity), we note three points.</p><p>First, unlike model 1, the quantity elasticities of all brands are less than one in magnitude in model 3. This suggests a relaxation of restriction R2a to the extent that the slope of the hazard function of the overall stochastic term can take negative values. This also matches with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bucklin et al. (1998)</ref>, who report all quantity elasticities less than one in magnitude, using the same data set. Second, unlike model 1, the quantity elasticities in model 3 are not as close to −1 (they range from −0 8093 to −0 8849). This implies that R2b gets relaxed for model 3. Third, unlike model 1, the expected conditional budget shares calculated at the mean values of the explanatory variables in model 3 are different across all brands (they are 0.0421 for Nordica, 0.0475 for Yoplait, 0.0423 for private label, 0.0479 for Dannon, and 0.0428 for WBB), implying that R1 is relaxed. Thus, in summary, R1, R2a, and R2b seem to get relaxed for the finite mixture heterogeneity model as compared to the no-heterogeneity case (model 1).</p><p>Comparing model 3 with model 2 (normal random heterogeneity), we see, first, that while model 3 yields quantity elasticities less than one in magnitude across all brands, model 2 does not. This implies that model 3 does better than model 2 in relaxing restriction R2a. Second, we see a smaller dispersion of the quantity elasticities from −1 in model 3 as compared to model 2. This implies that model 3 performs worse than model 2 in its ability to relax restriction R2b. Third, model 3 yields a smaller dispersion in the values of the expected conditional budget shares across the five brands as compared to model 2. This implies that model 3 performs worse than model 2 in its ability to relax restriction R1.</p><p>The results above relate closely to our hypotheses in §3.3 on the extent to which the two specifications satisfy the properties needed to relax the restrictions. Because the finite mixture specification (model 3) is semiparametric, it is more flexible than normal random heterogeneity (model 2), which enables model 3 to yield values of the quantity elasticities of all brands less than one in magnitude (and thereby relax R2a more). However, the finite mixture specification does worse than the normal random specification in capturing the underlying heterogeneity (the BIC for model 2 is 1,807.2 versus 2,152.3 for model 3). As a result, the finite mixture heterogeneity model per-435 forms worse than the normal random heterogeneity model in its ability to relax restrictions R2b and R1. 15 4.3.4. Model 4-Mixture Normal for Unobserved Heterogeneity. As pointed out in §3.3, because the mixture normal is a very flexible specification, we would expect it to do a good job of capturing the actual heterogeneity in the data. This is borne outthe BIC for model 4 is 1,792.1 versus 1,807.2 for model 2 and 2,152.3 for model 3. An added advantage of the flexibility of the mixture normal distribution is that the overall stochastic term will be flexible enough to enable the slope of its hazard function to take a wide range of positive or negative values. Comparing population-level elasticities for model 4 given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> with those of model 2 (normal random heterogeneity) and model 3 (finite mixture heterogeneity), we see three points of note.</p><p>First, similar to model 3 and unlike model 2, the quantity elasticities of all brands are less than one in magnitude in model 4. This implies that R2a is more relaxed for model 4 as compared to model 2. Second, similar to model 2, and unlike model 3, the quantity elasticities in model 4 are not close to one in magnitude (they range from −0 5107 to −0 8530). This implies that R2b is more relaxed for model 4 as compared to model 3. Third, similar to model 2, the expected conditional budget shares calculated at the mean values of the explanatory variables show a wide dispersion across brands (0.0387 for Nordica, 0.0484 for Yoplait, 0.0386 for private label, 0.0526 for Dannon, and 0.0424 for WBB at the mean values of the explanatory variables). This implies that R1 is relaxed for model 4.</p><p>In summary, model 4 does a better job in relaxing the three restrictions as compared to both model 2 (normal random heterogeneity) and model 3 (finite mixture heterogeneity). This stems from the fact that, unlike models 2 and 3, model 4 satisfies both the properties needed to relax the restriction: similar to the finite mixture specification (and unlike the normal random specification), it provides flexibility. Similar to the normal random specification (and unlike the finite mixture specification), it captures the underlying heterogeneity well. 4.3.5. Summarizing. For the case where the econometrician's errors are IID EV distributed, as we go from the no-heterogeneity case to the most flexible specification of heterogeneity, restrictions R1, <ref type="bibr">15</ref> As mentioned earlier, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Song and Chintagunta (2007)</ref>, who use the finite mixture specification of heterogeneity, find quantity elasticities to be close to −1 across all brands in two categories and between −0 74 to −0 9 across brands in the other two categories. This is similar to our finding that the finite mixture heterogeneity succeeds only partially in relaxing the restrictions on quantity elasticities.</p><p>R2a, and R2b each get relaxed. In particular, we find that for the no-heterogeneity case (model 1), all three restrictions hold. For the mixture normal specification of heterogeneity (model 4), all three restrictions get relaxed the most. For the other two cases-namely, normal random (model 2) and finite mixture heterogeneity (model 3)-the restrictions only get relaxed partially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications</head><p>We compare model 4 with models 1-3 along two dimensions. First, for each model, we discuss whether the predicted hierarchy across the five brands in terms of their quantity elasticities is consistent on prior research. Following that, we compare the models in terms of their predictions on primary versus secondary demand elasticities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Hierarchy in Quantity Elasticities</head><p>Across Brands We rank order the brands in terms of their quantity elasticities for model 4 (mixture normal heterogeneity), which relaxed the restrictions the most. The ranking is (i) −0 8530 (private label), (ii) −0 6668 (Yoplait), (iii) −0 6008 (Dannon), (iv) −0 5715 (Nordica), <ref type="bibr">16</ref> and (v) −0 5107 (WBB).</p><p>It is natural to ask if this hierarchy is consistent with prior research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al. (1999)</ref> found that the two factors that differentiate brands on their quantity elasticities are (i) the extent of brand loyalty (the greater the loyalty, the greater the magnitude of the quantity elasticity) and (ii) price variability (the greater the price variability of a brand, the greater the quantity elasticity). <ref type="bibr">17</ref> In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, we report the brand loyalty and price variability (as percentages) across all five brands. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Note that the private label ranks the highest along both factors, which implies that its quantity elasticity should be the highest, which is what we get. Although Yoplait's brand loyalty is almost the same as that of private label, its price variability is low. Thus, its quantity elasticity would be expected to be lower than the private label, as our results show. Dannon and Nordica rank lower than Yoplait on both factors and thus have lower quantity elasticities than Yoplait. Finally, WBB ranks the lowest on both factors and thus has the lowest quantity elasticity.</p><p>Next, we compare the hierarchy across brands in terms of their quantity elasticities as predicted by models 1-3. In model 1 (no unobserved heterogeneity), because the quantity elasticities of all brands are restricted to be very close to one in magnitude, we do not observe any hierarchy across brands. Similarly, for model 3 (finite mixture heterogeneity), we do not observe a clear hierarchy across brands because the quantity elasticities are not statistically different from each other. Finally, for model 2 (normal random heterogeneity), we see that the private label has the highest quantity elasticity (−1 0627) and WBB has the lowest (−0 7920), which is reasonable based on the two factors given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. However, the quantity elasticities for the other three brands do not follow the hierarchy based on the two factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Primary vs. Secondary Demand Effects</head><p>We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al. (1999)</ref> and decompose the total elasticity into primary and secondary demand components. The primary demand elasticity component is computed as incidence elasticity plus quantity elasticity, as a percentage of the total elasticity. We report the primary demand elasticity components across all five brands for models 1-4 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. Observe that, across all brands, model 4 predicts the lowest primary demand elasticity percentage. Furthermore, averaged across all brands, we see that the primary demand component is 52.5% for model 1, 52.1% for model 2, 50.4% for model 3, and 43.6% for model 4. There are two points to note here. First, the average primary demand elasticity component for model 4 is very similar to that obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bucklin et al. (1998)</ref>, who used the same data set. Second, this decomposition tells us that one would overestimate the primary demand component if one did not correct for the restrictions properly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The principal objective of this paper was to formally examine the reasons behind the restricted quantity elasticity estimates obtained in the Hanemann's framework and suggest solutions for these restrictions. Our analytical results and empirical examination suggest that the specification of unobserved heterogeneity should be a crucial consideration for future researchers attempting to use Hanemann's framework to examine consumer behavior. More specifically, it is important to use a specification of heterogeneity that (i) adequately captures the true underlying heterogeneity in the data and (ii) is flexible in terms of the slope of its hazard function taking a wide range of positive and negative values. In particular, we show that the mixture normal unobserved heterogeneity does a better job in relaxing restrictions on quantity elasticities than the normal or finite mixture specifications of heterogeneity. This suggests that empirical modelers building integrated models of the incidence, choice, and quantity decisions are best served by using a mixture normal specification of unobserved heterogeneity. We view our work as providing a foundation for a number of empirical industrial organization questions pertaining to those categories where consumers buy multiple units of an alternative on a purchase occasion. For instance, suppose one wishes to examine the change in consumer welfare and firm profits over different pricing policies, e.g., quantity discounts or bundling. To address this appropriately, one would have to model demand carefully, which would entail modeling a consumer's incidence, choice, and quantity decisions as arising from a joint utility maximization framework. Because the policies under consideration would be expected to affect the consumer's quantity choice decision, it would be crucial to assess quantity response accurately. Hanemann's framework with our proposed solution to ease the restriction on quantity elasticities is precisely suited to such an exercise. Coupled with a suitable supply-side specification, researchers can obtain a number of useful recommendations on pricing and product line policies. For instance, is a "buy one, get one" deal profitable in the short run? Would it be profitable to prune the assortment of products offered in a particular category?</p><p>Our work suffers from some limitations that could provide opportunities for further research. Perhaps most importantly, one needs to conduct an analysis similar to ours on a number of additional data sets across diverse product categories. The restrictions we have shown formally in the lemmas are independent of data, but the relative efficacies of the remedies we suggest rely on the extent of the true underlying heterogeneity in the data, suggesting the need for analysis across a variety of data sets.</p></div>
