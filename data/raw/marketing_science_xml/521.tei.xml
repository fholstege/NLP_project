<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>I think I am seriously addicted to Greek yogurt. For a while, I've been having it every day for breakfast. It's just so good Anyway, the point is that I'm a little worried that having the same thing for breakfast every day is not good for me. So I tried having orange-carrot juice and an apple for breakfast. I'm going to try the juice thing or something else for a while though, and maybe later I'll come back to Greek yogurt. It could happen.</p><p>The breakfast diary of an anonymous consumer indicates a continuous period of consumption of Greek yogurt, then orange-carrot juice, and then Greek yogurt again. This pattern of behavior is not atypical for frequently purchased, nondurable goods-many readers will recognize similar patterns in their own everyday lives. For some period of time, consumers are strongly inclined to use or consume a certain product repetitively. This "obsession" with the product then ends for various reasons (as we will later discuss) and possibly resumes again after a hiatus.</p><p>The consumption behavior of the anonymous consumer quoted above resembles the purchase history of yogurt and other products in IRI household panel data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bronnenberg et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we show the weekly yogurt purchase behavior of two panelist households over a two-year period. "Purchase" and "No purchase" represent weeks with and without a yogurt purchase, respectively. Household A repeatedly purchases yogurt for the first 17 weeks and then does not purchase yogurt for 38 weeks. Recognizing that yogurt is very perishable, the long period of not purchasing suggests that the household did not consume any yogurt for most of this period. This no-purchase period is followed by another period of frequent yogurt purchasing, which is followed by another period of not purchasing. Household B shows a similar cyclical purchasing pattern.</p><p>How prevalent are such cyclical purchasing patterns? To answer this question, we look in greater detail at the proportion of yogurt-purchasing households that display long periods of nonpurchase and nonconsumption in the IRI data. Because in these data we can only observe purchasing, and not consumption behavior, we consider three product categories that are quite perishable-yogurt, milk, and frankfurters-so that we may be able to infer periods of nonconsumption based on periods of nonpurchasing. We first define the terms "purchase week," "no-purchase week," and "no-consumption period" for the yogurt category (analogous definitions apply to the other two categories). If a household purchases any product in the yogurt category in a certain week, that week is labeled a purchase week and if not, a nopurchase week. A no-consumption period (NCP) is defined as a period of consecutive no-purchase weeks that lasts 10 or more weeks. Our rationale for choosing a 10-week threshold is based on the best by date shown on yogurt containers. We conducted a field survey of this date that revealed that the average best by date is 28 days, or four weeks (standard deviation, 8 days), from the date of purchase (the day we performed the field survey). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Even though some households may consume yogurt for a week or two past the best by date, it is very unlikely that a household is consuming inventoried yogurt 10 weeks past the best by date. In other words, our method is likely to understate the occurrence of no-consumption periods.</p><p>In IRI's household panels in Eau Claire, WI and Pittsfield, MA, 4,298 panelist households (HHs) purchased yogurt (excluding drinkable yogurt) at least once (i.e., their count of a purchase week is at least one) over a period of 104 weeks in <ref type="bibr">2003 and 2004.</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the distribution of NCPs in the data. Of the 4,298 HHs, 73% show one or more NCPs, and 49% show two or more NCPs. The average length of NCPs in the data is 19.7 weeks. To get insights into households that buy yogurt more frequently, we consider the 1,559 HHs whose count of a purchase week is 20 or more. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Of these HHs, 62% show one or more NCPs, and 33% show two or more NCPs. Similar statistics are provided for the milk and frankfurter categories in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Based on the best by dates that we observed in these categories in our field survey, 4 the NCP is defined as a period of consecutive no-purchase weeks, which lasts 6 weeks or more for milk and 18 weeks or more for frankfurters.</p><p>The simple analysis presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reveals that in the three categories, a substantial proportion of households show cyclical category purchase behavior. In each of the three categories, over two-thirds of buying households display at least one episode of several consecutive weeks of no purchases. This episode is long enough that in these perishable categories we can be reasonably certain there is nonconsumption as well. Moreover, this phenomenon is not limited to infrequent category buyers-over half of frequent buyers in the three categories also display at least one such episode. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Our goal is to propose a descriptive model of the kind of cyclical purchasing behavior for which we have provided evidence. We believe that the observed cyclicality is a manifestation of cross-category substitution by the consumer, caused by "variety-seeking" a Frequent category buyers are defined as HHs whose count of purchase weeks is at least 20 in yogurt, 40 in milk, and 9 in frankfurters over a 104-week period. These thresholds are the mean counts of purchase weeks in the respective categories.</p><p>tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing activities in all relevant categories. 6 A complete, utility-based model of multicategory buying would incorporate these causal phenomena explicitly. However, a significant challenge in applying such a model to data is identifying the complete set of substitute categories and obtaining consumer-level data, including firms' marketing activities, for each category; this is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, motivated by the same theoretical idea, in the present paper we develop a statistical model of buying in one category. Our statistical model allows for periods of high-versus-low purchasing tendencies in the target category, which leads either to continued purchasing in the category or to not purchasing (which implicitly means switching to a substitute category).</p><p>We propose a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendencies in a category. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides the stream of purchase decisions of each consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values that characterize high and low purchase tendencies. Specifically, we introduce a regime-switching intercept in the consumer's indirect utility function. We interpret the regime-switching intercept as a proxy for the consumer's inventory in categories that are substitutes for the target category. For instance, the consumer in our opening quote tends to consume orange-carrot juice or an apple (substitute categories) during periods when the consumer has a low purchase tendency for yogurt (the target category). The regime-switching intercept approximates the level of substitute inventory, which is unobservable to the researcher but can be inferred from the consumer's purchasing behavior. Previously, similar Markov regime-switching models (or hidden Markov models) have been used to capture changes in consumers' Internet browsing goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Montgomery et al. 2004</ref>) and changes in latent relationship states with the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Netzer et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers are assumed to be heterogeneous in their intensities of high and low purchase tendencies. In addition to category purchase incidence, we also consider consumers' brand choice decisions and the impact of marketing mix variables within the random coefficient logit framework. Because the proposed model nests the typical random coefficient logit model without Markov regime-switching parameters, we can test whether purchase behavior can be better characterized by allowing for switches in category purchase tendencies.</p><p>This interpretation of the regime-switching intercept highlights an important methodological concern with models of category purchase incidence. We expect that the target category inventory and substitute category inventory are negatively correlated, and both influence the consumer's purchase decision in the target category. As a consequence, the omission of substitute category inventory may cause an endogeneity problem. This problem is widespread because, to our knowledge, almost all applications of random utility models to category buying ignore substitute category inventory. We investigate the problem of endogeneity of target category inventory empirically and demonstrate how the proposed model handles it.</p><p>In addition to including heterogeneity across consumers and parameter dynamics (regime switching), the proposed model also incorporates unmeasured product characteristics (i.e., common shocks) and considers the endogeneity of prices. To handle the endogeneity of prices, we use the control function method <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Petrin and</ref><ref type="bibr">Train 2010, Park and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gupta 2009)</ref>. The resulting Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model accounts for parameter dynamics, heterogeneity across consumers, endogeneity of prices, and endogeneity of inventory.</p><p>We apply the proposed model to yogurt purchases from a sample of households and find that as many as 38.3% of the households display cyclicality in buying, after controlling for the effects of marketing mix variables, state dependence in brand choice, and inventory. Predictions from the proposed model track observed purchases of households closely, and the model also fits better than two benchmark models. We show that if the model ignores the underlying dynamics of switching between high and low purchase tendencies, an endogeneity problem arises.</p><p>We also show that cyclicality in buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a temporary price reduction that is offered to a household during its high purchasing tendency period results in greater increases in sales than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up the opportunity for customized timing of price reductions as a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions. We show via simulation that in our sample data, a one-time 30% price reduction on Yoplait with customized timing leads to an 89% increase in the impact of the promotion, relative to a randomly timed promotion. Finally, because the proposed model can be challenging for firms to estimate, we explore the use of simple descriptive statistics of consumers' purchasing behavior (mean and standard deviation of interpurchase times) to classify households into groups based on their cyclicality in category buying. Furthermore, a simple rule of thumb based on past purchasing allows the firm to guess quite successfully whether a household is in the high or low purchase state. These findings reveal an opportunity for firms to improve the efficiency of their promotions without estimating the proposed model.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In §2, we present the model and briefly explain our estimation method (details of the estimation approach are available in the electronic companion to this paper, available as part of the online version found at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org/). In §3, we describe an empirical application of the model to scanner panel data and discuss our key findings and their managerial implications. Finally, in §4, we summarize the contributions of this article and identify future research issues.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Model Formulation</head><p>We assume that on each shopping trip consumers either choose a brand that gives them the highest utility in the category or choose not to purchase in the category. In this paper, we model purchase incidence and brand choice behaviors. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> On each purchase occasion t = 1 T h , the utility for the outside good and the utility of brand j = 1 J in store s = 1 S 7 Purchase quantity is included via an inventory variable that affects the likelihood of buying in the category (i.e., incidence). We do not model the purchase quantity decision. This is reasonable in our empirical application to yogurt, a perishable category in which there is not much quantity variation across occasions (within consumer).</p><p>for consumer h = 1 H is given by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U s h0t = h t +INV ht INV h + s h0t if no purchase (1) U s hjt = j h + s h +P s jt P h +F s jt F h +D s jt D h +SD hjt SD h + s jt + s hjt j= 1 J (2)</formula><p>where INV ht is category inventory carried by household h at the beginning of a purchase occasion (or shopping trip) t, and P s jt , F s jt , and D s jt are the price, feature, and display of brand j in store s at t, respectively. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We incorporate state dependence through SD hjt , which is equal to 1 if the last purchased brand is j and 0 otherwise. Individual-specific preferences for brands and stores and responsiveness to price, feature, and display are represented by j h j=1 J , s h s=1 S , P h , F h , and D h , respectively. h t represents the utility of the no-purchase option for consumer h at time t. INV h represents the influence of consumer inventory on category purchase decisions. SD h captures the individual-specific state dependence effect. A positive coefficient implies positive state dependence, or inertia, whereas a negative coefficient implies variety seeking. Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random shocks with a Type I extreme value distribution are represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s hjt j=0 1 J s=1</formula><p>S . The unmeasured product characteristics (UPCs), s jt , may include, for example, the impact of unobserved promotional activity, coupon availability, shelf space, national advertising, unquantifiable factors, and systematic shocks to demand. We can raise two issues related to s jt . The first issue is the endogeneity problem. If marketers make their decisions based on the values of s jt , marketing mix variables would be correlated with s jt . In particular, empirical research has typically reported a correlation between price and s jt (or price endogeneity) in disaggregate as well as in aggregate data. Because of this correlation, s jt is not necessarily mean zero given marketing mix variables, and thus, we cannot treat it as another error component and integrate it out of the demand function. Furthermore, regardless of the correlation with marketing mix variables, ignoring s jt would force the model to absorb these effects in the i.i.d. random shock and/or the remaining explained part of the utility. As a result, one could get biased estimates of model parameters <ref type="bibr">(Chintagunta et al. 2005, Park and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gupta 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A key feature of our model is consumers' switching between high and low category purchase tendencies.</p><p>To capture this, we use a Markov regime-switching random coefficients framework. The resulting model divides the purchase stream of each consumer into distinct regimes with different parameter values, and regime-switching dynamics follow a first-order Markov process. We describe a two-regime model and also apply this model to data. An extension to three or more regimes is straightforward. We specify model parameters as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h t =¯ 0 1 − S ht +¯ 1 S ht + a h a h ∼ N 0 2 a (3) Pr S ht = 0 S ht−1 = 0 = exp Const + HC HC h + INV INV ht + MIX MIX ht 1 + exp Const + HC HC h + INV INV ht + MIX MIX ht = q ht (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Pr S ht = 1 S ht−1 = 1 = exp Const + HC HC h + INV INV ht + MIX MIX ht 1 + exp Const + HC HC h + INV INV ht + MIX MIX ht = p ht (5) h =¯ + b h b h ∼ N 0 (6)</formula><p>where h is a vector of s, is a covariance matrix of heterogeneity parameters, and HC h is a household-specific variable that represents household demographics or characterizes household consumption behaviors (we consider household size, average purchase quantity, and the number of category purchases in our empirical application). MIX ht is a household-and time-specific marketing mix variable that influences household's cyclical category buying behavior (we consider price, display, and feature in our empirical application). S ht is an indicator of unobservable discrete states that take the values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a high category purchase tendency and 1 indicates a low category purchase tendency. Note that the parameter dynamics in h t are dominated by S ht , which are individual-specific and evolve idiosyncratically. These determine each consumer's switching behavior between high and low category purchase tendencies. For illustration, let us assume that¯ 0 &lt;¯ 1 , S ht = 0 for t = 1 10, and S ht = 1 for t = 11 20. Then (1), the utility of no purchase, becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">U s h0t =¯ 0 + a h + INV h t INV h + s h0t for t = 1</formula><p>10, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">U s h0t =¯ 1 + a h + INV h t INV h + s h0t for t = 11</formula><p>20. Since¯ 0 &lt;¯ 1 , the probability of no purchase is lower (i.e., the probability of category purchase is higher) when t = 1 10 than when t = 11 20 In this manner, we operationalize high and low purchase tendencies. We expect that the level of inventory in substitute categories is low (high) during the high (low) purchase tendency period. Thus, 0 and¯ 1 can be interpreted as low and high levels of inventory in substitute categories, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, we expect that h t is negatively correlated with INV ht . If the correlation is ignored, an endogeneity problem may arise. This type of endogeneity has been termed "intercept endogeneity" (in contrast with "slope endogeneity"; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Luan and Sudhir 2010)</ref>. We resolve this issue by specifying a process that governs the correlation. S ht follows the household-and time-specific first-order Markov process specified in (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>). s and s link the likelihood or the probability of regime switches to household-and time-specific characteristics HC h , INV ht , and MIX ht .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model Estimation</head><p>There are three issues in the estimation of the proposed model: the first is how to make inferences on the unobservable discrete-state indicator S ht , the second is how to handle heterogeneity related to as and bs, and the third is how to handle the unmeasured product characteristics s jt and the endogeneity of marketing mix variables. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> To make inferences on the unobservable discrete-state indicator S ht , we first consider the joint density of the observed outcome and the state indicator, and we then integrate the state indicator out of the joint density by summing over all possible values of the state indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hamilton 1989</ref>). To handle heterogeneity, we use the simulated maximum likelihood estimator (SMLE). To handle s jt and the related endogeneity issue, we use the control function method. Details of estimation are provided in Appendix 1 of the electronic companion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Benchmark Models</head><p>In addition to the proposed model, we estimate two benchmark models that allow us to compare the performance of the proposed model to that of a representative extant approach that accounts for serial dependence in the category purchase decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benchmark 1</head><formula xml:id="formula_7">U s h0t = 0 h + INV ht INV h + LagInc ht LagInc h + s h0t if no purchase (7) U s hjt = j h + s h + P s jt P h + F s jt F h + D s jt D h + SD hjt SD h + s jt + s hjt j = 1 J (8)</formula><p>In this model, a lagged incidence variable LagInc ht is added to the usual random coefficient logit model to capture serial dependence in category purchase incidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ailawadi and Neslin 1998)</ref>. Because our main interest is in the serial dependence in category purchase incidence, it is reasonable to consider this model as a starting benchmark. LagInc ht is equal to 1 if yogurt was purchased on the last shopping trip and 0 otherwise. Note that state dependence in brand choice is separately considered by the term SD hjt . Also, we consider unmeasured product characteristics and price endogeneity. To estimate this model, we use the control function approach.</p><p>As noted previously, the Markov regime-switching coefficient h t in the proposed model captures unobservable inventory in substitute categories, which is expected to be negatively correlated with INV ht . If the substitute inventory is an important factor in a consumer's utility but cannot appropriately be explained by LagInc ht , then s h0t should absorb the influence of the substitute inventory. Consequently, an endogeneity problem arises in (7) (we refer to this as an "inventory endogeneity problem" hereafter 10 ) because of the negative correlation between the regressor INV ht and the random error s h0t . Moreover, we expect that this endogeneity problem will bias the estimate of INV h negatively. In the next section, we show that the inventory endogeneity problem does arise in our data but is obviated in the proposed model by introducing the Markov regime-switching coefficient h t .</p><p>Benchmark 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">U s h0t = 0 h + INV ht INV h + T E ht TE1 h + T E 2 ht TE2 h + 1/T E ht TE3 h + s h0t if no purchase (9) U s hjt = j h + s h + P s jt P h + F s jt F h + D s jt D h + SD hjt SD h + s jt + s hjt j = 1 J (10)</formula><p>The difference relative to Benchmark 1 is the removal from U s h0t of LagInc ht and inclusion instead of three functions of T E ht , which is defined as time elapsed since the last purchase. The idea is that LagInc ht might not be flexible enough to model serial dependence in category purchase incidence, and the use of three functions of T E ht offers greater flexibility in this regard. This specification allows for a wide range of hazard shapes and has therefore been used successfully in modeling of interpurchase time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Singh et al. 2006</ref>). Also, we can regard these three functions as proxies for substitute inventory that may be related with T E ht . If so, the inventory endogeneity problem will also be remedied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>The data we use are histories of yogurt purchases of IRI BehaviorScan panel HHs in Eau Claire, WI over 104 weeks in 2003 and 2004. The yogurt category is appropriate for the application of the proposed model because yogurt is highly perishable and therefore offers little opportunity to stockpile. Hence, a consumer's switching behavior in category purchasing is mostly due to the consumer's intrinsic consumption preferences, not due to stockpiling.</p><p>Among 2,582 panel HHs in this market, 2,206 HHs purchased yogurt (excluding drinkable yogurt) more than once during the sample period. We focus on the three largest grocery stores (IRI key: 233779, 264075, and 653776). Purchases at these three stores amount to 80% of the total yogurt purchases in this area. Of 899 panelist HHs who purchased yogurt only in these three stores, we use data from 519 HHs (58%) who purchased yogurt seven or more times during the 104-week sample period. The use of frequent buyers helps the model identify switching behavior between high and low purchase tendencies. Notably, the selected 519 HHs account for 92% of total yogurt purchases made by the 899 HHs, thus constituting a segment that is of interest to firms in this industry. Hence, we believe our selection rule does not compromise sample representativeness too much.</p><p>We include the three largest yogurt brands (Yoplait, Dannon, and Wells) as well as "others" in the analysis. Sales of the three major brands account for 77% of total category sales in our sample. In addition, we include a no-purchase option defined as shopping visits without yogurt purchase. Within each brand, the purchase of any one of the different package sizes was counted as a purchase of the brand.</p><p>Prices are defined on a per-pint basis in our analysis. Price, display, and feature at the brand level were computed as market share-weighted averages of UPC-level variables. Descriptive statistics of the purchases and marketing mix variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Approximately 15% of store visits result in purchases of yogurt. Yoplait is the dominant brand in the market, with a 40% market share.    Notes. Estimates in bold are significant at p = 0 05. We report and discuss the estimation results for the parameters related to the handling of unmeasured product characteristics in Appendix 2 of the electronic companion.</p><p>To control for the endogeneity of price, we use prices at the other stores and quarter dummies as instruments. The price of a brand at a store is highly correlated with prices of the same brand at other stores because competing retailers are likely to be offered the same wholesale prices. 11 However, we do not expect the unmeasured product characteristics, especially those determined at retail (e.g., shelf-space allocation), to be systematically related with wholesale prices. To the extent that this expectation is true, our instrumental variables are valid for controlling for the endogeneity of prices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Estimation and Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports the estimation results of the proposed model and the two benchmark models. As mentioned previously, the benchmark models and the proposed model are estimated with the control function method. For the normalization, we let¯ 0 , 0 h , and s=1 h be equal to 0. We specify the covariance matrix of heterogeneity distribution as a diagonal matrix. In (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), we incorporate the inventory variable INV ht and explanatory variables MIX ht and HC h into the transition probabilities. In the estimation of the proposed model, we considered (1) household size, (2) average purchase quantity, and (3) the number of yogurt purchases during the sample period as candidates for HC h in the proposed model. We use the number of yogurt purchases during the sample period because it shows the best result in model fit measures (i.e., log-likelihood (LL), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)). Also, we let MIX ht be equal to the average yogurt price at the store where household h visited at time t.</p><p>Benchmark 1 is the usual random coefficient logit model with a lagged incidence indicator variable. The mean of the lagged incidence parameter is significant and negative. This tells us that, on average, category purchase on one shopping trip is negatively related to the likelihood of no purchase, or positively related to the likelihood of purchase, on the next trip. This supports the empirical findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ailawadi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 30(3), pp. 469-480, © 2011 INFORMS Neslin (1998, p. 393)</ref>, who attribute a positive effect of lagged incidence on subsequent category purchase to represent "eating bouts, binging, special diets," etc. Both the mean and the heterogeneity parameters of state dependence are positive and significant, and they imply that most households are inertial in their brand choices. As expected, price has a significant negative coefficient, and the effects of feature and display are positive and significant. On average, households' intrinsic brand preferences can be ordered as Yoplait &gt; Dannon = Others &gt; Wells. This preference order is preserved in all three models. The mean parameter of inventory is negative and significant, and this implies that the more inventory a household has, the lower the probability of no purchase. This result is both counterintuitive and counter to what previous research has documented. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The same result also occurs in the other benchmark model. We suspect that this is due to the inventory endogeneity problem. Neither benchmark model considers inventory of substitute categories, which is likely negatively correlated with INV ht . As a consequence, s h0t contains the influence of omitted substitute category inventory, and a negative correlation between INV ht and s h0t biases the estimate of INV h negatively. We now consider the effect of including flexible functions of time to capture the serial dependence in purchase incidences by comparing the results of Benchmarks 1 and 2. In Benchmark 2, we use three functions of T E ht instead of LagInc ht , and all three fit measures (log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC) improve slightly over Benchmark 1. The mean of estimates for T E ht /10 2 is significant and positive, but those of T E ht /10 and 1/T E ht are not significant. Note that the mean parameter of INV ht is still negative and significant. This result tells us that the functions of T E ht do not work as adequate proxies for the substitute category inventory. To summarize, incorporating flexible functions of T E ht enables Benchmark 2 to capture serial dependence in purchase incidence better than Benchmark 1, but this does not solve the problem of inventory endogeneity.</p><p>We now discuss the results of the proposed model. The parameters related with individual-level dynamics (¯ 1 and are significant. These estimates imply that consumers switch between states of high and low purchase tendencies, which are characterized by¯ 0 = 0 and¯ 1 = 2 10, respectively. Specifically, the average probability of no purchase is 0.61 when¯ 0 = 0 and 0.91 when¯ 1 = 2 10. Equivalently, the probability of purchasing yogurt on a given visit is 0.39 when a household has a high purchase tendency and is 0.09 <ref type="bibr">12</ref> For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gupta (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ailawadi and Neslin (1998)</ref> report that the effect of household inventory on the probability of no purchase is positive.</p><p>when it has a low purchase tendency. Estimates of HC and HC tell us that HC h , or the number of yogurt purchases during the sample period, is significantly positively related to the probability of being in a high purchase tendency state and significantly negatively related to the probability of being in a low purchase tendency state. That is, frequent buyer households are more likely to be in a high purchase tendency state, a finding that is intuitive. Estimates of INV and INV tell us that INV ht is significantly negatively related to the probability of being in a high purchase tendency state and significantly positively related to the probability of being in a low purchase tendency state. This implies that a household is more likely to be in a high purchase tendency state when it has low level of inventory. This finding is also reasonable and consistent with previous empirical literature. Finally, estimates of MIX and MIX tell us that MIX ht , or the average price, is not significantly related to the transition probabilities. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Using the parameter estimates, we can make inferences on the probability that a certain period t belongs to a specific state. This probability is referred to as the smoothed probability, and we denote it using P S ht hT h T h t=1 . 14 By investigating the smoothed probability, we obtain valuable insights into individual-level parameter dynamics, or the households' switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendencies. For the classification of each household's state at t, we assume that household h has high purchase tendency if P S ht = 1 hT h is significantly smaller than 0.5 and has low purchase tendency if P S ht = 1 hT h is significantly larger than 0.5. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Based on these rules, 20.7% of the observations (or 17,943 visits) are classified as a high purchase tendency state, 68.0% (or 58,782 visits) as a low purchase tendency state, and the remaining 11.34% (or 9,767 visits) as an indeterminate state (i.e., P S ht = 1 hT h is not different from 0.5). Average durations of high and low purchase tendency states are 56.4 visits (or 35 weeks) and 103.2 visits (or 64 weeks), respectively. Among the 519 households, 199 households (38.3%) show switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendencies during the sample period (we call this group "switching"). Within these households, average durations of high and low purchase tendency states are 31.8 visits (or 477 20 weeks) and 62.9 visits (or 39 weeks), respectively. Two hundred twenty-seven households (43.7%) have low purchase tendencies, and 85 households (16.4%) have high purchase tendencies throughout the sample period (we call these groups "low" and "high," respectively). The proposed model's improvement in model fit compared with the static parameter models (i.e., Benchmarks 1 and 2) is mainly attributable to the substantial proportion of households that show switching behaviors. Figure 2 shows P S ht = 0 hT h T h t=1 with 90% confidence bands for three representative households. We see that the first household (HHID = 3 104 976) shows switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendencies, the second household (HHID = 3 100 008) has a low purchase tendency, and the last household (HHID = 3 109 140) has a high purchase tendency during the entire sample period.</p><p>The mean and heterogeneity parameters of inventory (INV) are both significant. In particular, most households have positive coefficients, which imply that the larger the inventory before the shopping trip, the higher the utility of no purchase. This result is intuitive and in line with previous empirical studies. Note that the results from the two benchmark models indicate the opposite: the estimated effects of inventory are all significantly negative. The proposed model captures the unobservable substitute inventory using regime-switching variables and thereby overcomes the inventory endogeneity problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Managerial Application: Optimal Timing of</head><p>Targeted Promotions The proposed model captures households' switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendencies by introducing a Markov-switching term in the latent utility. What are the managerial implications of such switching behavior of consumers? We answer this question by identifying a unique opportunity for targeted promotions that is implied by the results of our study. In this section, we show via simulation that an understanding of the dynamic nature of high and low purchase tendencies is useful in deciding the optimal customized timing of a targeted price promotion. Although targeting has been the subject of intensive study in the promotions literature, we believe the question of optimal timing has remained hitherto underexplored.</p><p>We focus here only on those households that show switching behavior in their yogurt purchase tendencies (38.3% of the sample households), because identification of this group is a contribution of our model. For this illustration, we assume the role of a product manager of Yoplait who is planning a targeted consumer price promotion-a one-time 30% price-off via a targeted coupon. Our goal is to measure the impact of the temporary price reduction on the choice probability of Yoplait when the timing of the offer is customized to each consumer based on our knowledge of that household's time-varying category purchase tendencies. This idea is explained in detail next.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the question of interest in our two-regime model is whether it is better to offer the price discount when a consumer is in a state of high or low yogurt purchase tendency. We assume  that the product manager's objective is to accomplish the greatest increase in unit sales of Yoplait, which is equivalent to maximizing the absolute increase in the choice probability of Yoplait (as indicated by the derivative of the choice probability). For simplification, we do not consider a competitive response to Yoplait's move, although we believe that would be an important extension to consider in future research.</p><p>For Yoplait (j = 1), the choice probability and derivative of choice probability with respect to price are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pr y s ht = 1 S ht = exp V s h1t exp ¯ 0 S ht +¯ 1 1−S ht +a h +INV h t INV h + J k=1 exp V s hkt (11) deriv s h1t S ht = Pr y s ht = 1 S ht P s 1t = Pr y s ht = 1 S ht 1 − Pr y s ht = 1 S ht P h (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where V s</p><p>hjt = j h + s h + P s jt P h + F s jt F h + D s jt D h + SD hjt SD h + s jt . Note that deriv s h1t S ht = 0 &gt; deriv s h1t S ht = 1 when Pr y s ht = 1 S ht = 0 &lt; 0 5. 16 Recalling that S ht = 0 indicates a regime of high yogurt purchase tendency, this inequality tells us that the price promotion achieves bigger increases in choice probability during a high purchase tendency period. Intuitively, this result implies that price discounts or other promotional activities are more effective when a consumer is more likely to purchase in the category, conditional on the brand choice probability being less than 0.5. This conclusion is consistent with the commonly observed phenomenon of more promotions being run in high seasons than in low seasons.</p><p>To verify this result in our sample yogurt data and to illustrate the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of high and low purchase tendencies, we compare the performance of two price promotion strategies using estimation results of the proposed model. Strategy 1 offers a 30% price reduction once in a week when a household has high purchase tendency; Strategy 2 provides a 30% price reduction once in a randomly chosen week (i.e., this is not a customized strategy). Strategy 2 is implemented with 100 random choices of promotion timing. Along with the two strategies based on the results of the proposed model, we perform a similar counterfactual simulation using the results of Benchmark 1. Recall that Benchmark 1 is a random coefficient logit model with a lagged incidence variable and unmeasured product characteristics, but there are no individuallevel dynamics in the model. Because lagged incidence was found to have a negative effect on the utility of no purchase, it follows that purchase incidence probability is high immediately after a purchase. Accordingly, we assume that each household is provided with a 30% price reduction once in a randomly chosen week immediately after a category purchase.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> summarizes the results of the three simulation studies. Strategy 1 attains an incremental choice probability of 77.9% for Yoplait, whereas Strategy 2 attains only 41.2% (on average across the 100 replications). This tells us that a brand manager can increase the impact of a price promotion from 41.2% to 77.9%-a gain of 89%-merely by optimizing the timing of the price promotion. In Benchmark 1, the incremental choice probability for Yoplait is 46.2%, which is better than Strategy 2 but considerably worse than Strategy 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Model Implementation Issues</head><p>From the perspective of managers, the model we have proposed is quite challenging to estimate. In this section we consider an approach to make the model more managerially useful. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> To begin with, we examine whether we can predict the classification of households into low, high, and switching groups using descriptive statistics of observed purchase histories as proxies rather than the proposed regime-switching model. For this analysis we divided the original 104-week data into an estimation sample (first 18 months) and holdout sample (last six months). The proposed model was then estimated on the estimation sample, and households were classified into the three groups using the model estimates. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> we show a scatterplot of the three groups of households with respect to the mean and standard deviation of their interpurchase times. This analysis shows that these two variables are likely to be good predictors of households' membership into the three groups. A discriminant model fit to predict households' membership in the three groups using household-level average interpurchase times and household-level standard deviation of interpurchase times as predictors shows good classification ability: the correct classification rate of the model at 63.5% vastly exceeds that because of chance (proportional chance criterion yields 33.4%).</p><p>Next, we simulate the effect of a one-off 30% temporary price reduction on Yoplait in the six-month holdout sample data, similar to the exercise described in the previous section. We target 163 households that have been predicted to belong to the switching group by the discriminant model. Note that because of classification error, only 61%, or 99, of these 163 households were identified by the Markov-switching model as switching and the rest were identified as high or low. Strategy 1 is to offer the price reduction to a household when it is in a high purchase tendency state.</p><p>To predict the state in the absence of a model, we adopt the following rule of thumb: if a household is observed to purchase yogurt on two consecutive store visits, we assume the household is in a high state. Thus, Strategy 1 is to offer a household the price reduction on the visit immediately after two consecutive yogurt purchase visits. As before, Strategy 2 provides a price reduction once in a randomly chosen week (i.e., this is not a customized strategy). Strategy 2 is implemented with 100 random choices of promotion timing. The incremental choice probability under Strategy 1 is found to be 35.6% whereas under Strategy 2 is found to be 24.4% (averaged across 100 trials). Thus, there is a 46% improvement in performance. Importantly, in this exercise we did not use the estimates from the proposed model, only the conceptual learning that was derived from the model, descriptive statistics of the households' purchasing histories, and a rule of thumb to determine when a household is in a high state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and Future Research</head><p>We develop a Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model and apply it to investigate consumers' alternating behavior between high and low category purchase tendencies. We find that purchases in the yogurt category can be better explained by introducing switching levels in the latent utility of no purchase than by a static model, after controlling for the influence of marketing mix variables, inventory, and state dependence. We also find that 38.3% of sample households switched between high and low category purchase tendencies during the 104-week sampling period.</p><p>From a methodological point of view, we propose a unique Markov regime-switching random coefficient logit model that incorporates individual-level parameter dynamics. In the empirical application of the proposed model, we show that individuallevel dynamics are crucial in explaining individuals' idiosyncratic alternation between high and low category purchase tendencies. Also, we show that alternations between high and low purchase tendencies approximate substitute inventory, and if one ignores these, an inventory endogeneity problem occurs and consequently results in biased estimates. Moreover, to our knowledge, the proposed model is the first time-varying parameter discretechoice model that considers unmeasured product characteristics and endogeneity of marketing mix variables.</p><p>We demonstrate a managerial application of our proposed model to the targeting of customized price promotions. Because 38.3% of sample consumers move between states of high and low category purchase tendencies, their response to a targeted price promotion varies depending on when they receive the promotional offer. We find that offering promotions to consumers when they have a high purchase tendency enhances the effectiveness of the promotion. In the yogurt data, we show that a brand manager can increase the impact of a price promotion by Marketing Science 30(3), pp. 469-480, © 2011 INFORMS 89% merely by optimizing the timing of price reduction. We believe this finding is noteworthy because it introduces a new dimension to targeted marketing decisions-timing. We also show that a firm can implement targeted promotions with customized timing using easily available descriptive statistics of households' purchasing histories.</p><p>Several directions exist for further research. Investigating the household's switching behaviors between high and low purchase tendency over multiple categories is an important area for additional research. Dynamics in several categories may be correlated, and this knowledge will be valuable in understanding and predicting consumers' category purchase decisions. Given the nature of our data, our investigation of a consumer's switching behavior remains at a correlational level. In future research, it will be important to explain a consumer's switching behavior in a category purchase at the causal level and identify the underlying mechanisms of such behavior. Also, in the current specification, transition probabilities are explained by household inventory, marketing mix variables, and consumption behavior in the focal category (i.e., yogurt), but not by those in the substitute categories. These omitted variables of substitute categories are likely to be correlated with included variables, and this requires attention in future work.</p><p>In this study, the proposed model and two benchmark models are based on the random utility approach. As alternatives to random utility models, marketing researchers have also employed probability models such as Markov chains that may provide an efficient way to model consumers' switching behaviors in multiple categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Seetharaman 2003)</ref>.</p><p>We believe that the cyclicality is a manifestation of cross-category substitution caused by varietyseeking tendencies and the firm's marketing activities. Alternative theoretical explanations might be consistent with such behavior. In economics, literature on "rational addiction" provides an alternative theory to explain cyclical consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dockner and Feichtinger 1993)</ref>. In addition to internal factors, external factors (e.g., news, introduction of a new product, price changes, advertising or promotions, and seasonal availability) may also explain consumers' switching behavior between high and low purchase tendency episodes. Disentangling these explanations will provide important insights into consumers' cyclical category buying behaviors.</p></div>
