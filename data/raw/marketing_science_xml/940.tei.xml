<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A household's prior purchase experiences with specific brands typically influence the household's purchase propensities for the same brands in the future. In such cases, there is said to be structural state dependence in the household's brand choices over time. Structural state dependence can be positive or negative, in which cases they are called inertia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jeuland 1979</ref>) and variety seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(McAlister 1982)</ref>, respectively. The existence of inertia motivates marketers' employment of promotional schemes such as free sampling in the hope that the current-period costs of distributing free samples will be more than offset by the benefits of "hooking" households to the brand for the long term. The existence of variety seeking motivates the lengthening of product lines by manufacturers, in the hope that households' varietydriven brand switching benefits their franchise. There has been a lot of empirical work in marketing over the past 20 years on the estimation of structural state-dependence effects using scanner panel data. The consensus that has emerged in this literature is that there is substantial evidence of structural state dependence in households' brand choices even after adequately controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across households <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Keane 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Abramson et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Moshkin and Shachar 2002</ref>. In this literature, structural state dependence is modeled using an exponentially smoothed loyalty variable constructed on the basis of all previous choices of the household as a covariate in the household's random utility for a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Guadagni and Little 1983)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the abovementioned structural statedependence effects (i.e., the effects of lagged choices), there is a second source of state dependence in a household's brand choices over time, namely, the effects of the household's lagged utilities for brands. This source of state dependence is called habit persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Heckman 1981b)</ref>. For example, if a household's relative evaluation of brand j is high during a shopping trip at time t, the household's favorable evaluation of brand j is likely to persist during the household's next shopping trip at time t + 1 even if the household does not actually purchase brand j at time t. Such lagged utility effects imply that even if a brand's current promotions do not stimulate households to purchase the brand in the current period, they may induce them to purchase the brand in the future (through the persistence in favorable brand evaluations). In this study, we propose a distributed lag model of brand choices that accounts for not only structural state dependence, using a loyalty variable, but also three distinct sources of habit persistence. The first, called carryover effects, arises on account of marketing-mix effects on households' brand choices "spilling over" into future periods, for example, due to decaying effects of advertising and reference price effects. The second, called habit persistence type 1, arises on account of temporal persistence in households' utilities for brands for reasons unknown to the researcher, for example, due to the effects of guests staying over at home, which necessitates purchases of similar brands to suit their needs over time. The third, called habit persistence type 2, measures temporal dependencies between a household's successive brand choices that arise on account of multiple (unobserved) information signals that households keep receiving over time between purchases (from such sources as billboard signs, television advertisements, etc., that are not recorded in the data). In other words, our proposed model accounts for state dependence 1 in as complete a manner as possible, and generalizes previously proposed state-dependence models such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allenby and Lenk (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Roy et al. (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane (1997)</ref>, etc. that have accounted for only a subset of the effects captured in our model. We derive implications for marketing strategy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heckman's (1981b)</ref> model allows an individual's current utility for an alternative U jt to be related both to the individual's lagged choice outcome for the alternative and the individual's lagged utility for the same alternative U jt−1 . One specific parametric form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heckman's (1981b)</ref> model is given below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model Formulation</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">U jt = j + X jt * + * I jt−1 + * U jt−1 + jt (1)</formula><p>where U jt and U jt−1 stand for the household's random utility for brand j at time t and t − 1, respectively; X jt is a vector of explanatory variables (marketing variables such as price, display, and feature in the context of brand choices) characterizing alternative j at time t; I jt−1 is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if alternative j was purchased at time t − 1 and 0 otherwise; and jt is a random error term that captures the effects of unobserved variables.</p><p>In this model, j and are the alternative-specific intercept and the vector of marketing-mix response parameters, respectively, while parameter estimates the effect of structural state dependence, while parameter estimates the effect of habit persistence.</p><p>Consider the following distributed lag model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U jt = j + X jt +X jt−1 * +X jt−2 * 2 +X jt−3 * 3 +••• * + * I jt−1 +I jt−2 * +I jt−3 * 2 +I jt−4 * 3 +••• + jt + jt−1 * + jt−2 * 2 + jt−3 * 3 +••• (2)</formula><p>where the variables and parameters are as explained in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), except that here stands for a geometric decay parameter (which lies between 0 and 1).</p><p>It is easy to show that <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Heckman's (1981b)</ref> model of structural state dependence and habit persistence, in the form laid out in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), is a reduced-form representation of this distributed lag model as long as the parameter of the lagged utility variable, , is constrained to lie within 0 1 . 2 There are three distinct sources of state dependence modeled in the random utility formulation (2): one, carryover effects of marketing variables; two, geometrically decaying effects of lagged choices; three, geometrically decaying effects of lagged random errors. Despite this flexibility, this model is based on the restrictive assumption of identical decay parameter for all three sources of state dependence. We relax this assumption by allowing for separate s for each of the three sources of state dependence to obtain a more flexible distributed lag model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U jt = j + X jt +X jt−1 * 1 + X jt−2 * 2 1 +X jt−3 * 3 1 +••• * + * I jt−1 +I jt−2 * 2 +I jt−3 * 2 2 +I jt−4 * 3 2 +••• + jt + jt−1 * 3 + jt−2 * 2 3 + jt−3 * 3 3 +••• (3)</formula><p>where 1 2 3 ∈ 0 1 capture geometric decay effects in marketing variables, lagged choices, and random error terms, respectively. This model is more flexible than (2) and allows us to endogenously test whether 1 = 2 = 3 . A suitable parametric assumption on the random errors, jt , yields an estimable model of discrete choices. We assume the contemporaneous error term jt = jt + jt−1 * 3 + jt−2 * 2 3 + jt−3 * 3 3 + • • • to be distributed Type-I extreme value, which yields the familiar Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, except that the error terms are now serially correlated. We call this model Multinomial Logit with Serial Correlation (MNLSC, for short). The intuition for the three separate state-dependence effects captured under this specification is as follows: 1 , capturing carryover effects, arises on account of marketingmix effects "spilling over" into future periods, for example, due to decaying effects of advertising over time, reference price effects etc.; 2 , capturing lagged choice effects, arises on account of structural statedependence phenomena such as households' brand loyalties, variety-seeking tendencies etc.; 3 , capturing habit persistence type 1, arises on account of persistence in households' utilities for reasons unknown to the researcher, such as due to the effects of guests staying over at home, which necessitates purchases of similar brands to suit their needs over time.</p><p>A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Roy et al. (1996)</ref> employed the mover-stayer formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goodman 1961)</ref>, a type of Markov chain, to estimate the effects of habit persistence. The estimable version of their model is shown below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P jjt = + 1 − * MNL jt P ijt = 1 − * MNL jt (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where P jjt stands for the household's conditional probability of buying brand j at time t given that the household bought brand j at time t − 1 (i.e., repeat-purchase probability), P ijt stands for the household's conditional probability of buying brand j at time t given that the household bought brand i at time t − 1 (i.e., switching probability), ∈ 0 1 is the habit-persistence parameter (with = 1 yielding a pure habit-persistence model), and MNL jt stands for the household's Multinomial Logit Probability for brand j, given by MNL jt = e j +X jt * + * I jt−1 J k=1 e k +X kt * + * I kt−1</p><p>(5)</p><p>where , the coefficient of the lagged choice variable, captures structural state dependence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Resnick and Roy (1990)</ref> show that the mover-stayer model of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) can be derived from utility maximization. Specifically, they show that is a measure of serial correlation between the household's utilitymaximizing alternatives on successive purchase occasions, using a utility framework called the "Lightning Bolt" framework. The serial correlation is motivated to arise on account of multiple (unobserved) brandspecific information signals that households keep receiving over time between purchases (from such sources as billboard signs, television advertisements, etc., that are not recorded in scanner panel data).</p><p>We embed our MNLSC model, given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), within the Lightning Bolt utility framework to obtain the following estimable model of state dependence. 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P jjt = + 1 − * MNLSC jt P ijt = 1 − * MNLSC jt (6)</formula><p>where MNLSC jt is the household's choice probability for brand j at time t, obtained using the random utility function in (3). Equations ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) collectively represent our proposed model. Four sources of state dependence are represented in this model: 1 captures the geometrically decaying effects of lagged marketing variables (carryover effects), 2 captures the geometric decay in the effects of lagged choices over time (structural state dependence), 3 is the serial correlation parameter for the random errors (habit persistence type 1), and captures serial correlation in the household's utility-maximizing alternatives on successive purchase occasions (habit persistence type 2).</p><p>We restrict the state-dependence parameters 1 , 2 , 3 , and to lie within the closed interval −1 1 , where positive values represent inertia and negative values represent variety seeking. Suppose the most recent lagged choice has a negative effect on the current choice (i.e., &lt; 0). A negative estimated value for 2 would then imply that the second-most recent lagged choice has a positive effect on the current choice, which is consistent with the variety-seeking explanation that encourages alternating between brands rather than repeat-purchasing them. Allowing the parameter to lie within the closed interval −1 1 , as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998)</ref>, yields the following final version of our proposed model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P jjt = + 2 + 1 − * MNLSC jt P ijt = − 2 * J − 1 + 1 − * MNLSC jt (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where &gt; 0 corresponds to positive state dependence (and reduces the model to the form given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)), while &lt; 0 corresponds to negative state dependence. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, we present a detailed comparison of our model with previously proposed random utility models of state dependence in marketing.</p><p>It is easy to show that our measure of carryover effects is similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Erdem and Sun (2001)</ref>, our measure of structural state dependence is mathematically equivalent to the exponentially  smoothed brand loyalty measure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref>, our measure of habit persistence type 1 is mathematically equivalent to the AR(1) measure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allenby and Lenk (1994)</ref>, and our specification of habit persistence type 2 is identical to that in Seetharaman and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chintagunta (1998)</ref>. We integrate all of these effects within a random utility formulation for the first time in the literature. We model the effects of unobserved heterogeneity (a.k.a. "spurious" state dependence, Heckman 1981a) by assuming that all parameters follow a joint, multivariate discrete distribution across households, whose supports' locations and probability masses are estimated from the data. Such a semiparametric specification of heterogeneity has been extensively used in brand-choice models to estimate household segments, and has been shown to have favorable statistical properties compared to parametric specifications of heterogeneity (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chintagunta et al. 1991)</ref>. We assume the existence of K segments, hence K support points for the heterogeneity distribution, and estimate separate parameter vectors for each support point (as will be explained in the estimation section). To test the robustness of our empirical findings to alternative heterogeneity specifications, we also allow all parameters to follow a joint, multivariate normal distribution across households (as in, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Seetharaman et al. 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial Implications</head><p>Here we discuss the managerial implications of separately modeling the four sources of state dependence as well as unobserved heterogeneity in our proposed model: Because structural state dependence and habit persistence type 2 measure the effects of lagged brand choices, a marketing implication of such effects, when they are positive, is that distributing free samples of a brand can "hook" households into consuming the same brand in the future at regular prices. The marketing implication of such effects, when they are negative, is that increasing the length of the firm's product line in the product category will retain variety-seeking households who switch between the firm's brands within the firm's "franchise." The estimated carryover effects, on the other hand, have implications for dynamic marketing policies of firms. For example, even if a price reduction on a brand benefits current sales of the brand, it may adversely impact future sales of the brand to the extent that households' reference price for the promoted brand is lowered subsequent to the price reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kopalle et al. 1999)</ref>. The estimated effects of habit persistence type 1 have no obvious direct consequences for planning marketing strategy because they measure temporal persistence due to variables that are not observed by the marketing researcher. However, to the extent that the marketing manager is in a better position than the academic researcher to speculate on what may drive such unobserved temporal persistence in brand choices-because they observe more variables of interest in the product market under study than does the marketing researcher-the manager may be able to strategically respond to such estimated effects in practice. At the very least, accommodating the effects of habit persistence type 1 in the brand-choice model aids model specification, and therefore enables the correct recovery of the effects of marketing variables and the other state-dependence effects in the model. Last, but not least, the estimated extent of unobserved heterogeneity in model parameters across households spells possible opportunities for the brand manager to develop differentiated marketing offerings to appeal to different segments of the marketplace. It also allows the manager to develop targeted couponing activities based on households' differential sensitivities to marketing variables and their statedependence proclivities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Lagged Promotions on State Dependence</head><p>Modeling the effects of prior promotional purchases on current choices has precedence in the brand-choice literature (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Shoemaker and Shoaf 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Dodson et al. 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Guadagni and Little 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Neslin and Shoemaker 1989</ref>. In line with this research stream, and following up on an experimental study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kahn and Louie (1990)</ref>, we investigate whether a household's propensity to be state dependent is a function of lagged marketing variables. We accommodate the effects of lagged promotions by allowing the parameter to be a function of the marketing variables of the brand during the previous purchase occasion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Estimation</head><p>Each household's conditional (on its location in the unobserved heterogeneity distribution) likelihood function L h s is computed by applying the proposed model's probability formulas (Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>)) over the household's observed string of purchases.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L h s = J j=1 P hj1 hsj1 * N h t=2 J j=1 P hjt hsjt (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where P hsjt stands for household h's probability of buying brand j on purchase occasion t conditional on its observed choice of brand on its previous purchase occasion (computed using the appropriate choice of formula from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>)), given that it belongs to support s of the heterogeneity distribution, N h stands for the number of purchase occasions corresponding to household h, J stands for the total number of brands, and hjt is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if brand j is purchased by household h at time t and 0 otherwise. Each household's unconditional likelihood function is then computed by integrating the conditional likelihood function over a multivariate, discrete distribution of unobserved heterogeneity across households <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chintagunta et al. 1991)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L h = S s=1 s * L h s (10)</formula><p>which is multiplied across households to obtain the sample likelihood function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L = H h=1 L h (11)</formula><p>The sample likelihood function is then maximized using gradient-based methods to obtain maximumlikelihood estimates of model parameters. We also test a continuous distribution for unobserved heterogeneity, specifically a multivariate normal distribution with unknown means and variances. In this case, the household's unconditional likelihood function is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L h = f s L h s ds (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where f s stands for the multivariate normal density characterizing the unobserved heterogeneity distribution. Because this multivariate integral does not have an analytical closed form, the likelihood function in this case is computed using Monte Carlo simulation, i.e., by making a large number (say S * ) of draws from the multivariate normal distribution and using the following approximation for the likelihood function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L h = 1 S * S * s * =1 L h s * (13)</formula><p>One issue that deserves discussion is the specification of the initial conditions, i.e., the value of the choice probability for the first purchase occasion of each household P hsj1 . Investigating this presents a problem of significant computational and economic complexity (as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane 1997)</ref>. We assume the initial conditions to be exogenously prespecified. Specifically, we use only those lags for which data is available and ignore earlier lags. To the extent that lags are geometrically decaying and each panelist gives a reasonably long time-series of purchases, this assumption may not be restrictive in our application. This is also consistent with the procedure adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Roy et al. (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Seetharaman et al. (1999)</ref>.</p><p>A last issue that deserves mention pertains to the accounting of the serial correlation in the Type-I extreme value errors of the random utility function. Because we assume an AR(1) scheme, the errors are simulated using the following scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Landwehr et al. 1979</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_15">): i = − ln − ln z i z i = 3 * z i−1 + 1 − 2 3 * u i (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where is the standard normal cdf 3 is the firstorder autocorrelation parameter, and u i is a standard normal variate. We tested a parsimonious approximation procedure for this serial correlation structure that yielded nice closed-form expressions for the likelihood function (details of this procedure are available from the authors). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Results and Discussion</head><p>We employ A. C. Nielsen's scanner panel data on household purchases in the ketchup category from January 1985 to January 1987. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Choosing households that bought only among the top eight brands (that account for 87% of all product sales) in the product category yields 3,032 households. From these households, we use only those that made at least seven purchases over the study period. This yields a sample of 529 households, making a total of 5,954 purchases in the category. The largest item-Heinz 32 oz.-has a conditional market share of 37.8% and enjoys the maximum display activity.</p><p>We estimate the proposed model of state dependence as well as six nested versions of the model in order to investigate the consequences of incompletely specifying state dependence in households' brand choices. Given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> are the fit results for the seven models. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The full model fits observed brand-choice outcomes better than the other seven models. In order to ascertain that we are not overfitting the data by using models with more parameters, we perform a validation task using a holdout sample. Specifically, we re-estimate the seven models using the first 80 weeks of the data and compute the validation log-likelihoods based on the estimated parameters for the last 25 weeks of the data. Given in the last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> are the results of this exercise. The proposed model outperforms the other models in the holdout sample. This underscores the importance of accounting for state-dependence effects in as complete a manner as possible.</p><p>For the full model, the discrete heterogeneity specification fits the data better than the continuous heterogeneity specification. The structural state-dependence measure turns out to be much more predictive of observed brand choice outcomes than either source of habit persistence. For example, including the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref> loyalty variable in the MNL model improves fit by 11.4% (Models 5 versus 7), while adding both types of habit persistence improves fit only by an additional 0.4% (Models 1 versus 5). It is remarkable that despite the number of papers and alternative model specifications that it has spawned, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guadagni and Little's (1983)</ref> measure of structural state dependence still remains the most important source of state dependence characterizing brand-choice data. Even a flexible model such as that of Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998)-i.e., Model 3-while fitting better than the MNL model with a lagged choice variable-i.e., Model 6 <ref type="bibr">Landwehr 1988, Seetharaman et al. 1999)</ref>-fits worse than the other four state-dependence models tested in this study. Our findings that structural state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity capture most of the observed temporal dynamics in households' brand choices are consistent with the findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane (1997)</ref>.</p><p>We present the parameter estimates for the seven estimated models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. The estimates of the effectiveness of marketing variables are understated in models that incompletely account for state-dependence effects. For example, the magnitude of the estimated price/display/feature parameter in Model 7 is lower than that in Model 6, which in turn is lower than that in Model 5, etc. To the extent that the estimated price elasticities are systematically understated if the effects of state dependence are ignored or incompletely accounted for, optimal pricing policies derived therefrom will be systematically distorted as well.</p><p>The inertia and variety-seeking model of Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998), i.e., Model 3, recovers one segment of consumers (i.e., support 3, with a probability mass of 0.20) that shows negative structural state dependence (lagged choice coefficient of −5 95). Model 2, however, which uses all lagged choices (using the distributed lag structure) instead of the most recent lagged choice only, shows positive structural state dependence for all three supports. This shows that underspecifying structural state dependence, using only the most recent lagged choice variable (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Seetharaman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chintagunta 1998, Roy et al. 1996, etc.)</ref>, may lead one to spuriously estimate variety-seeking effects when in fact they do not exist. If the marketing manager used the results of Model 3, she may be tempted to extend the product line of her franchise to exploit the benefits of variety seeking when, in fact, the results of Model 3 do not justify such a line-extension strategy.</p><p>Under the inertia and variety-seeking model of Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998), i.e., Model 3, the magnitude of habit persistence type 2 is overestimated. For example, the estimated habit persistence for one segment of consumers (support 3, with a probability mass of 0.20) is 0.78 according to Model 3, and only 0.05 according to Model 1. Distortions in estimated state dependencies such as these may lead product managers to advertise more than necessary in the hope that favorable household evaluations of their products will persist over time and increase their long-term profits, when in fact the reality may dictate more cautious optimism.</p><p>Ignoring habit persistence type 1 (going from Models 1 and 4 to Models 2 and 5, respectively) Notes. HP1 = Habit persistence 1; HP2 = Habit persistence 2; SD = Structural state dependence; BIC, Bayesian Information C riterion.</p><p>understates the estimated structural state-dependence effect. This indicates that even though the estimated serial correlation in the errors of the random utility function may not be directly useful for managerial action, because it captures state dependencies in households' brand choices for reasons unobserved to the researcher, modeling its effects is useful to obtain correct estimates of managerially useful lagged choice effects. Ignoring the effects of habit persistence type 1 may lead marketing managers to undervalue the long-term effects of promotional incentives such as free sampling.</p><p>Ignoring habit persistence type 2 (going from Models 1, 2, and 3 to Models 4, 5, and 6, respectively) overstates the estimated structural statedependence effect. This means that the structural state-dependence parameter would proxy for the effects of unmodeled habit persistence, say, if one used <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane's (1997)</ref> model instead of our proposed model. In order to understand whether the total documented extent of state dependence is recovered correctly (even if the source to which it is attributed is wrong), we compute the incremental share gain, by numerical simulation, for the leading brand of ketchup (Heinz 32 oz.) from running an integrated promotional campaign of 20% price off, coupled with a store display and a newspaper feature advertisement during a single week. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we plot the incremental gain in share points as a function of time since promotion. The predicted impact of a sales promotion is observed to increase and last a longer time as one includes additional sources of state dependence in the brand choice model. This means that underspecified models suffer from an inability to accurately assess the total incremental impact of a sales promotion. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> This finding, coupled with the predictive validation findings of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, suggests that even if decomposing state dependence into its four sources is not useful in and of itself, it is still necessary from the standpoint of accurately estimating market demand.</p><p>Ignoring habit persistence type 1 (going from Models 1 and 4 to Models 2 and 5, respectively) or habit persistence type 2 decreases the magnitude of the intercept associated with the largest-share brand, i.e., Heinz 32 oz. This means that measures of brand equity for large brands may be systematically understated if one ignored habit-persistence effects. Because brand equity stands for the intrinsic strength of a brand, i.e., the share of market it will attain in the absence of marketing activities and statedependence effects, it is important for firms to be able to quantify it correctly to signal brand strength to the marketplace.</p><p>The estimated values of the choice decay parameter, i.e., 2 , are close to 0.8 and consistent with values typically used for the exponential smoothing parameter in previous operationalizations of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref> loyalty variable. The estimated values of the error decay parameter, i.e., 3 , are close to 0.9 and consistent with those estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allenby and Lenk (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane (1997)</ref>. Because these estimates are close to one in magnitude for two of the three supports of the heterogeneity distribution, we explicitly test for the possible presence of (undesirable) unit roots. Using a one-sided t-test, we are able to reject the null hypothesis of the error decay being equal to 1 at the 0.01 level of significance (for example, under Model 1, the estimates of 0.93, 0.08, and 0.94 are associated with standard errors of 0.02, 0.0003, and 0.02, respectively). In other words, we conclude that the estimated serial correlations are less than one in all cases.</p><p>To investigate whether habit persistence is a function of lagged marketing variables, we allow the parameter to be a logistic function of lagged  marketing variables. The results of this hierarchical regression are given below in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. We find that lagged price has a negative effect (i.e., Price &lt; 0), while lagged display and feature have positive effects (i.e., Disp &gt; 0 and Feature &gt; 0) on the habit-persistence parameter. That is, households are more habit persistent with brands that were on promotion during the previous purchase occasion. This is a new empirical finding in the state-dependence literature, and can be used by brand managers to investigate the relative benefits of free sampling versus competitive pricing in terms of boosting long-term profits for their brands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We propose and estimate a random utility model of brand choices that accommodates four distinct sources of state dependence in addition to unobserved heterogeneity across households. The proposed model generalizes and is more flexible than previously proposed state-dependence models in the marketing and labor econometrics literatures. We demonstrate the empirical consequences of ignoring one or more of these sources, and run promotional simulations to illustrate the managerial consequences of using underspecified state-dependence models. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Keane (1997)</ref>, we find that structural state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity capture most of the observed temporal dynamics in households' brand choices. All the results obtained are remarkably similar across four different categories of packaged goods, which highlights the crosscategory generalizability of our findings.</p><p>It would be of interest to investigate the drivers of unobserved persistence in households' brand choices over time, such as due to habit persistence type 1. One driver of such persistence could be national advertising efforts of brands, which are typically unaccounted for in scanner panel datasets. Supplementing available datasets with information on national advertising expenditures of brands will allow one to explicitly understand both their effects on households' brand choices and whether they mitigate the estimated serial correlations in the unobservables.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Seetharaman:</head><label></label><figDesc>Modeling Multiple Sources of State Dependence in Random Utility Models: A Distributed Lag Approach 264 Marketing Science 23(2), pp. 263-271, © 2004 INFORMS</figDesc></figure>
