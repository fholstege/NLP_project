<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>T he past few years have seen increasing interest in taking the notion of customer lifetime value (CLV) and extending it to value a customer base (with subsequent links to corporate valuation). The application of standard textbook discussions of CLV leads to calculations based on a single retention rate. However, at the cohort level, retention rates typically increase over time. It has been suggested that these observed dynamics are due, in large part, to a sorting effect in a heterogeneous population. We show that failing to recognize these dynamics yields a downward-biased estimate of the residual value of the customer base (compared to an aggregate analysis that ignores these dynamics). We also explore the implications of failing to account for retention dynamics when computing retention elasticities and find that the frequently reported values underestimate the true effect of increases in underlying retention rates in a heterogeneous world.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The past few years have seen increasing interest in taking the notion of customer lifetime value (CLV) and extending it to value a customer base, with subsequent linkages to the value of a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bauer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Gupta et al. 2004</ref>). As we undertake such valuation exercises, it is essential to ensure that our underlying calculations are correct, i.e., fully reflective of the factors that underlie the observed behavior.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical contractual business setting where the firm's customer base is described as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The firm acquired 10,000 customers in 2003, 6,334 of whom renewed their contracts at the beginning of 2004. By 2007, 2,604 members of this cohort were still customers of the firm. Another cohort of 10,000 customers was acquired in 2004; by 2007, 3,264 of them were still customers of the firm. For this hypothetical firm, the average net cashflow per <ref type="bibr">1</ref> As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fader and Hardie (2009)</ref>, a defining characteristic of a contractual (or subscription) business setting is that the loss of a customer is observed. For example, the customer has to contact the firm to cancel her cable TV contract; similarly, a magazine publisher can observe that a subscriber has not renewed his annual subscription. This is in contrast to a noncontractual setting, a defining characteristic of which is that the loss of a customer is not observed by the firm.</p><p>customer is $100/year, which is "booked" at the beginning of the contract period.</p><p>Suppose it is December 31, 2007, and we ask the question: "What is the expected residual value of the 26,569 customers currently on the firm's books?" (For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that each contract is annual, starting on January 1 and expires at 11:59 p.m. on December 31. Furthermore, we assume a 10% discount rate.)</p><p>Any student who has been taught the basic principles of customer lifetime value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kotler and Keller 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Lehmann and Winer 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Ofek 2002</ref>) would likely take the following approach: First, he would calculate the aggregate retention rate as 2 604 + 3 264 + 4 367 + 6 334 / 3 264 + 4 367 + 6 334 + 10 000 = 0 691 2 2 <ref type="bibr">Farris et al. (2006, p. 132</ref>) define the retention rate as "the ratio of the number of retained customers to the number at risk." As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">PricewaterhouseCoopers (2002)</ref>, the two standard ways of determining the "number at risk" are (i) the number of customers at the beginning of the period of interest and (ii) the average of the opening and closing balance of customers for the period of interest. The first approach is clearly the more appropriate choice given the discrete-time nature of the setting we are examining.  Using the logic of standard textbook expressions for CLV, he would then calculate the expected residual value of this group of customers as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">26 569 × t=1 $100 × 0 691 t / 1 + 0 1 t−1 = $4 945 049</formula><p>Most professors would pat this student on the back, encouraged that he had been able to apply this important course concept. (This is consistent with the methods used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bauer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Gupta et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, and Wiesel et al. 2008</ref> The only problem is that this answer is wrong; as we shall soon see, this calculation underestimates the value of the customer base by 38%! So what is wrong with this approach? Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports the annual cohort-level retention rates as computed off the numbers presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (e.g., 6 334/10 000 = 0 633). We note that although the aggregate numbers (bottom row) are fairly constant, the cohort-level numbers are increasing quite substantially over time. (Note that the growth pattern in this stylized example is the same for each cohort.)</p><p>Clearly, any attempt to compute the expected residual value of this customer base needs to recognize the intercohort differences at any point in time (e.g., the different 2006/2007 retention rates for each cohort). Furthermore, it is necessary to project each cohort's (increasing) retention numbers beyond the set of observed retention rates <ref type="bibr">(i.e., to 2007/2008, 2008/2009, and beyond)</ref>.</p><p>We therefore need a model of relationship duration that can be used to project the growth of the retention rates beyond 2007, from which we can then compute a customer's expected residual lifetime value (and therefore the expected residual value of the whole customer base). In developing this model, we need to provide a valid explanation for the phenomenon of increasing retention rates at the cohort level. In §2, we present an exploratory analysis in which this phenomenon is simply an artifact of crosssectional heterogeneity in individual retention probabilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gupta and Lehmann 2005, pp. 29-31)</ref>; this is examined more formally and systematically in §3 using the shifted-beta-geometric model of contract duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Fader and Hardie 2007a)</ref>. We then explore the implications of failing to account for retention dynamics on the true magnitude of "retention elasticities." We conclude with a discussion of several issues that arise from this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">An Initial Exploration</head><p>Suppose we track a cohort of 10,000 customers, consisting of two underlying segments: Segment 1 comprises one-third of the customers, each with an unobserved (and unobservable) time-invariant annual retention probability of 0.9, and Segment 2 comprises two-thirds of the customers, each with a timeinvariant annual retention probability of 0.5. Looking at Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, we see that, as time progresses, the number of people in the pool of active customers with a (constant) high-churn probability (Segment 2) declines at a faster rate than the number of people with a (constant) low-churn probability (Segment 1). As a result, the cohort-level retention rate increases until members of Segment 2 effectively disappear, and therefore, it levels off to the rate of 0.9 associated with Segment 1 alone.</p><p>We see that the cohort-level retention rates are exactly the same as those reported for the cohort of customers acquired in 2003 (as presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), as well as the subsequent cohorts. The key observation is that the observed phenomenon of increasing cohortlevel retention rates is, in this case, purely an artifact of cross-sectional heterogeneity.</p><p>This observation should not come as a surprise to any serious student of customer retention (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gupta and Lehmann 2005, pp. 29-31)</ref> as it is a well-known "ruse of heterogeneity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Vaupel and Yashin 1985)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Yet it is generally ignored in subsequent calculations of customer lifetime value and ignored in any customerbase valuation exercise. As we shall see, the impact of ignoring the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates can be quite dramatic.</p><p>Let us consider the expected residual lifetime value of one of the 2,604 members of the 2003 cohort who is still active in 2007. If this person belongs to Segment 1, her expected residual lifetime value, E RLV , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E RLV r = 0 9 d = 10% = t=1 $100× 0 9 t 1+0 1 t−1 = $495</formula><p>whereas if she belongs to Segment 2,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E RLV r = 0 5 d = 10% = t=1 $100× 0 5 t 1+0 1 t−1 = $92</formula><p>However, the segment to which this individual belongs is unobserved.</p><p>According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that a member of the first cohort, still active in 2007, belongs to Segment 1 is P renewed contract four times Segment 1 ×P Segment 1 P renewed contract four times = 0 9 4 × 0 333 0 9 4 × 0 + 0 5 4 × 0 667 = 0 84 This informal analysis suggests that any calculation of the residual value of a customer base performed using a single aggregate retention rate will underestimate the true value of the customer base whenever the cohort-level retention rates are increasing over time. As we typically observe increasing cohort-level retention rates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie 2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Kumar and Reinartz 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Reichheld 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Schweidel et al. 2008</ref>, it is crucial that our calculations incorporate this phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Systematic Examination of the Effects of Heterogeneity</head><p>We have demonstrated that failing to account for heterogeneity in cohort-level retention rates can lead to an underestimation of the residual lifetime value of a customer (and therefore the value of the customer base). We now wish to undertake a more systematic study of this problem, still assuming that the dynamics in cohort-level retention rates stem entirely from cross-sectional heterogeneity. We will undertake this analysis using the shifted-beta-geometric (sBG) model for contract duration proposed and tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref>.</p><p>The sBG model is based on the following two assumptions:</p><p>(1) An individual remains a customer of the firm with constant retention probability 1 − ; this implies that the duration of the customer's relationship with the firm is characterized by the shifted-geometric distribution with survivor function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">S t = 1 − t t = 1 2 3</formula><p>(2) Heterogeneity in is captured by a beta distribution with probability density function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f = −1 1 − −1 B</formula><p>It follows that the probability that a randomly chosen customer's tenure is greater than t periods (i.e., the survivor function) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S t = B + t B t = 1 2 (1)</formula><p>The cohort-level retention rate for period t (r t ) is defined as the proportion of customers active at the end of period t − 1 who are still active during t, which is simply the ratio of sequential values of the survivor function, r t = S t /S t − 1 . Given (1), it follows that the retention rate associated with the sBG model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r t = + t − 1 + + t − 1</formula><p>(2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref> note that under this model, the retention rate is always an increasing function of time, even though the underlying (unobserved) individual-level retention probabilities are constant. Because there are no underlying time dynamics at the level of the individual customer, the observed phenomenon of retention rates increasing over time is simply a sorting effect in a heterogeneous population (i.e., the high-churn customers drop out early in the observation period, with the remaining customers having lower churn probabilities).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref> stop with the development and empirical testing of the sBG model. Now we take it to the next step by showing how to generate estimates of CLV given the model's parameters. This is, in essence, equivalent to the contribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fader et al. (2005)</ref>, who performed a similar task for the Pareto/NBD model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schmittlein et al. 1987</ref>) in a noncontractual setting.</p><p>Standing at the end of a customer's nth contract period, just prior to the point in time at which she makes her contract renewal decision, the expected residual lifetime value of a customer acquired at the beginning of period 1 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E RLV d active for n periods = t=n E v t S t t &gt; n − 1 1 + d t−n</formula><p>where E v t is the expected net cashflow in period t, assumed to be "booked" at the beginning of the contract period. (The summation index runs from t = n, not t = n + 1, since a customer active in period n has made only n − 1 contract renewals and the survivor function is P T &gt; t .) Assuming a constant expected net cashflow per period (i.e., E v t =v), we can factor it out of the calculation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E RLV d active for n periods =vDERL d active for n periods (3)</formula><p>where the discounted expected residual lifetime is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">DERL d active for n periods = t=n S t t &gt; n − 1 1 + d t−n = t=n S t S n − 1 1 1 + d t−n (4)</formula><p>When individual survival times are distributed shifted-geometric with parameter , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">DERL d active for n periods = 1− 1+d d + (5)</formula><p>However, is unobserved; we therefore need to take the expectation of (5) over the distribution of . But when n &gt; 1, we cannot use the original beta distribution f , since the fact that the person has survived to period n (i.e., has made n − 1 renewals) means that she is more likely to have a lower-thanaverage value of . We therefore use the posterior distribution of for an individual who is still a customer in period n. Recalling Bayes' theorem, it follows that DERL d active for n periods where 2 F 1 • denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric function. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> (See the appendix for details of how to compute this quantity when using a modeling environment that does not have a built-in routine for evaluating the Gaussian hypergeometric function.) Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is the focal expression for this paper and is derived here for the first time. Multiplied byv, it is the natural extension of the standard textbook CLV formula that recognizes (i) heterogeneity in churn propensities and (ii) the need to condition on the length of the customer's relationship with the firm when computing her residual value. It also makes explicit the fact that we are creating an expectation. This acknowledges the fact that CLV calculations are inherently probabilistic, not deterministic, as implicit in most discussions of the topic.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">= 1 0 1 − 1 + d d + S n − 1 f S n − 1 d = +n−1 + +n−1 2 F 1 1 +n + +n 1 1+d (6)</formula><p>Suppose a firm acquires a new cohort of 10,000 customers each year from 2003 to 2007. For different values of and , we will compare the expected residual value of the customer base at the end of 2007 as calculated using the naïve approach (a constant aggregate retention rate) with the true value that takes the (heterogeneity-induced) dynamics in the retention rates into account. We will assume that d = 0 1 (i.e., a 10% discount rate) andv = $1.</p><p>We start by considering two scenarios: Case 1 ( = 3 80 and = 15 20) and Case 2 ( = 0 067 and = 0 267). The shapes of the corresponding beta distributions are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In Case 1, the distribution of is relatively homogeneous with an interior mode. In Case 2, there is quite a bit of heterogeneity in the distribution of ; this U-shaped distribution indicates that some of the acquired customers have a high value of (i.e., a low retention rate), while a larger number of customers have a small value of . For both cases, E = 0 20. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports the number of active customers each year by year-of-acquisition cohort for both cases. (These numbers are computed using the sBG survivor function (1) and the customer acquisition numbers given above.) For Case 1, the aggregate 2006/2007 retention rate is 24 178/29 787 = 0 81; for Case 2, the aggregate 2006/2007 retention rate is 30 218/32 983 = 0 92. It follows that the naïve calculation of the expected residual value of the Case 1 customer base is 34 178 × $1 × t=1 0 81 t / 1 + 0 1 t−1 = $105 845; for Case 2, we have 40 218 × $1 × t=1 0 92 t / 1 + 0 1 t−1 = $220 488.</p><p>The rightmost column of each subtable in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports the discounted expected residual lifetime (given a 10% discount rate), as computed using (6), by year of acquisition. It follows that for Case 1, the correct value of the expected residual lifetime value of the customer base is 4 391 × 3 84 + 5 307 × 3 72 + 6 480 × 3 59 + 8 000 × 3 45 + 10 000 × 3 31 = $120 543. Thus the naïve calculation underestimates the true value by 12%. The equivalent correct value for Case 2 is $375,437, which means the naïve calculation underestimates the true valuation by 41%.</p><p>Referring back to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the (relatively) high degree of homogeneity in the distribution of for Case 1 means that the error associated with calculating the expected residual value of the customer base using the aggregate 2006/2007 retention rate is relatively small. However, for Case 2, where the distribution of is U-shaped, the error is much greater; a large number of customers have small values of and are therefore expected to have long relationships with the firm. The aggregate retention number cannot take this into account. Failure to take this heterogeneity into consideration will necessarily result in a highly biased estimate of the residual value of the customer base.</p><p>This effect of heterogeneity is also reflected in the DERL d active for n periods numbers reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. For Case 1, we see that there is very little variability in the numbers across cohorts, with the expected residual value of a customer who has made four renewals only being 16% higher than that of a customer who has made no renewals. On the other hand, in Case 2, there is a 33% difference.</p><p>Of course, these are but two possible sets of values for and . As we seek to undertake a more systematic investigation of the effects of heterogeneity on valuation error, we note that the parameters of the beta distribution can be characterized in terms of the mean = E = / + and the polarization index = 1/ + + 1 . The logic behind the polarization index is as follows: as → 0 (thus → 1), the values of are concentrated near = 0 and = 1, and we can think of the values of as being very different, or "highly polarized." As → (thus → 0), the beta distribution becomes a spike at its mean; there is no "polarization" in the values of . (For Case 1 above, = 0 20 and = 0 05; for Case 2, = 0 20 and = 0 75.) For a fine grid of points in the space, we compute the corresponding values of and then compute the expected residual value of the customer base using both the naïve calculation and the model-based methods.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents a contour plot of the percentage by which the naïve calculation method underestimates the true value of the customer base (as implied by the sBG model). For instance, as noted earlier, Case 1 has an underestimation of 12% while Case 2 has an underestimation of 41%. As expected, we see that when the individual retention rates are relatively homogeneous (low values of ), the error associated with calculating the expected residual value of the customer base using the naïve method is small. In the limit as → 0, there is no heterogeneity in and the sBG model tends to a pure shifted-geometric model (i.e., everyone has the same retention rate), and therefore there is no error associated with using the naïve method to value a customer base. However, as the level of heterogeneity increases (moving to the right of the figure), the magnitude of the error quickly becomes unacceptable. In such cases, any attempt to estimate the expected residual value of a customer base should be based on a formal model of contract duration. The only possible case where it is still acceptable to use the naïve method is when the mean underlying retention probability is very high (i.e., is very low).</p><p>It is worth noting that we would rarely find a business setting with very high churn probabilities (say, &gt; 0 4). As a result, the extreme levels of underestimation of residual value (70+%) will rarely be observed. However, even levels of 20% are very significant to the financial community, and it is easy to see such discrepancies arising for very realistic values of and . For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref> fit the sBG model to two actual (and typical) data sets; the estimated values of the mean and polarization index are = 0 15, = 0 18 and = 0 37, = 0 35. Applying these patterns of customer contract duration to the customer acquisition patterns used in the above analysis (i.e., 10,000 new customers each year), the naïve calculation of the residual value of the firm's customer base would underestimate the value computed using the sBG model by 28% and 48%, respectively.</p><p>The preceding analysis assumes that (i) every cohort is identical in size and (ii) the mean churn rates across the cohorts are also identical. In the electronic companion, we investigate the sensitivity of our conclusions to relaxing each of them. In particular, we allow (i) the size of each new cohort to be larger, smaller, or the same as that of the preceding cohort, and (ii) the mean churn rate of each new cohort to be higher, lower, or the same as that of the preceding cohort. These extended analyses provide clear evidence that our main result (i.e., the systematic underestimation of customer-base value when using a naïve calculation based on an aggregate retention rate) is insensitive to varying types of cross-cohort differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Implications for Retention Elasticities</head><p>There is a widely held belief that improvements in customer retention can have a major impact on customer (and therefore firm) value. Such an idea received a great deal of attention from work by Frederick Reichheld (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Reichheld 1996)</ref> and has been the focus of subsequent studies by researchers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gupta et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pfeifer and Farris (2004)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gupta et al. (2004)</ref> report retention elasticities ranging from 2.45 to 6.75, with an average of 4.88 (i.e., a 1% increase in the retention rate results in roughly a 5% increase in the value of the customer base). But these analyses are based on a formula that uses a single aggregate retention rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pfeifer and Farris (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Reichheld (1996)</ref> go one step further and allow for increasing retention patterns in some of their analyses, but neither one gives any consideration to the role (or even the existence) of heterogeneity and the need to condition on the length of the customer's relationship with the firm. In light of the analyses presented above, it makes sense to investigate how these elasticities change when we account for heterogeneity in retention rates.</p><p>Recall from (3) that the expected residual lifetime value of a customer acquired in period 1 who is still active in period n isvDERL d active for n periods . When individual survival times are distributed shifted-geometric with parameter , the associated retention elasticity (interpreted as the percentage increase in the customer's residual lifetime value for a given percentage increase in their underlying retention rate) 5 is given by ret d active for n periods</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">= DERL d active for n periods × DERL d active for n periods</formula><p>where = 1 − is the individual's (unobserved) retention probability and the expression for DERL d active for n periods) is that given in (5),</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">= 1 + d + d (7)</formula><p>Following the logic associated with the derivation of (6), we take the expectation of (7) over the posterior distribution of for a customer who has been active for n periods since acquisition, giving us ret d active for n periods</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">= 2 F 1 1 + n − 1 + + n − 1 1 1 + d (8)</formula><p>This is the retention elasticity for a randomly chosen individual acquired in period 1 who is still a customer in period n. We again assume a constant pattern of new customer acquisitions (i.e., 10,000 new customers each year) and no between-cohort variation in the mean churn rate. For each point on a fine grid of points in the space, we compute the retention elasticity for the corresponding customer base at the end of 2007. The resulting contour plot of retention elasticities is presented on the left-hand side of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>At first glance, these numbers seem consistent with those reported by other researchers. For example, the estimated values of the mean and polarization index for the first data set considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref> are = 0 15, = 0 18, which corresponds to an estimated retention elasticity of 6.5. Using the parameter estimates from the second data set ( = 0 37, = 0 35), the estimated retention elasticity is 4.9.</p><p>Looking more closely at this plot, the fact that the contour lines are not flat indicates that accounting for heterogeneity clearly matters when computing retention elasticities. To fully understand the importance of heterogeneity in this context, we examine how these elasticity estimates compare to those computed using the aggregate retention rate. We compute the corresponding naïve estimates of the retention elasticity by evaluating (7) using the aggregate churn rate associated with each point on the fine grid of points in the space; the resulting contour plot of naïve retention elasticities is presented on the right-hand side of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Comparing these two plots, we see that while the range of elasticities is the same, the pattern is quite different. We note that the elasticity estimates computed using the aggregate retention rate always underestimate the "true" values associated with the sBG model.</p><p>To get a sense of the magnitude of this error, we again consider the parameter estimates associated with the two data sets considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref>. For the first data set, the naïve elasticity estimate (5.0) is 23% lower than the model-based estimate (6.5). Likewise for the second data set, = 0 37, = 0 35, the naïve elasticity estimate (3.0) is 39% lower than the model-based value (4.9). Thus we find that failing to account for heterogeneity when computing the retention elasticity for a customer base underestimates the true value, just as we observed when computing the residual value of that same customer base. We can therefore conclude that accounting for heterogeneity makes a substantial difference when computing retention elasticities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The main message of this paper is that failing to account for cohort-level retention-rate dynamics leads to biased estimates of the residual value of a customer (and therefore a customer base). The simple example presented in § §1 and 2 illustrates the problem under the assumption that the observed increase in cohort-level retention rates over time is an artifact of cross-sectional heterogeneity in customers' unobserved (and unobservable) individual propensities to renew their contracts. The systematic analysis of the problem presented in §3 uses the sBG model of contract duration to capture the cohort-level retention-rate dynamics and finds that valuations performed using an aggregate retention rate underestimate the true value of the customer base by the order of 25%-50% in standard settings.</p><p>Marketing Science 29(1), pp. 85-93, © 2010 INFORMS Elements of the analysis presented in this paper may feel familiar to a serious student of the issues surrounding the calculation of customer lifetime value. As previously noted, the heterogeneity explanation for increasing cohort-level retention rates is a wellknown "ruse of heterogeneity" <ref type="bibr">(Gupta and Lehmann 2005, pp. 29-31;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Vaupel and Yashin 1985)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Blattberg et al. (2008, p. 180</ref>) note that "using an average retention rate can underestimate lifetime value" but do not explore the issue. <ref type="bibr">Gupta and Lehmann (2005, pp. 174-177)</ref> explore the issue of calculating CLV with increasing retention rates, concluding the differences are small. However, their analysis does not make an explicit comparison with an appropriately chosen aggregate retention rate. More fundamentally, their analysis ignores the implications of increasing retention rates when computing the residual value of an existing customer (i.e., using the conditional survivor function), which lies at the heart of any customer-base valuation exercise. As such, the true magnitude of the bias is not uncovered. We therefore conclude that the central message of this paper and the new result that drives it (i.e., ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)) are previously undocumented and important findings.</p><p>The analysis presented in this paper assumed that the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates is simply an artifact of the cross-sectional heterogeneity in customers' unobserved (and unobservable) constant propensities to renew their contracts at any point in time. Although there is strong empirical support for such an explanation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hardie 2007a, Schweidel et al. 2008)</ref>, we acknowledge that another explanation for this phenomenon is that the individual-level propensities to renew contracts are themselves changing over time. In such cases we can use a distribution such as the Weibull to characterize individual-level contract durations, coupled with an appropriate distribution to characterize cross-sectional heterogeneity. The logic of the analysis presented in this paper would still hold (e.g., we would simply evaluate (4) using the new survivor function). Similarly, when the cohort-level retention numbers are computed on a monthly basis, we may observe seasonality and the effects of introductory offers expiring. In such cases, the sBG model can be replaced by a model of contract duration that includes covariates to capture such effects-see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Schweidel et al. (2008)</ref>. However, we typically will not be able to come up with a closed-form solution to (4), relying instead on a numerical evaluation of the expression.</p><p>A potential limitation of our analysis is that we have not presented a formal analytical proof of the result, relying instead on numerical methods alone. Any formal proof would have to be conditioned on specific, limited assumptions about the relative size of each cohort, cohort-level mean churn rates, and so on. As previously noted, the electronic companion presents an extended analysis in which we allow (i) the size of each new cohort to be larger, smaller, or the same as that of the preceding cohort; and (ii) the mean churn rate of each new cohort to be higher, lower, or the same as that of the preceding cohort. This provides clear evidence that our main result (i.e., the systematic underestimation of customer-base value when using an aggregate retention rate) is insensitive to varying types of cross-cohort differences. Although these observations admittedly fall short of a formal proof that the bias will always exist (at least when the true, underlying behavior is governed by an sBG process), they demonstrate that this phenomenon has very broad applicability. We are therefore confident in concluding that any attempt to compute the residual value of a customer (and therefore a customer base) using an aggregate retention rate will lead to a biased estimate of the true value that takes cohort-level retention-rate dynamics into consideration.</p><p>Furthermore, this error is of sufficient magnitude for any careful analyst to want to proceed correctly. So how can we perform such a customer-base valuation exercise in practice? We first need to estimate the model parameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fader and Hardie (2007a)</ref> show how to do this when we have data from a single cohort of customers. However, in a customer-base valuation setting, we will have data from more than one cohort of customers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fader and Hardie (2007b)</ref> describe how to estimate the sBG model parameters in such a setting. Once we have estimates of the two model parameters, we compute DERL using (6) (or the approach outlined in the appendix using a simple Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Electronic Companion</head><p>An electronic companion to this paper is available as part of the online version that can be found at http:// mktsci.pubs.informs.org/. and solving the infinite sum. This provides us with a way of computing DERL d active in n when using a modeling environment that does not include the ability to evaluate the Gaussian hypergeometric function: assuming we can compute the survivor function associated with the sBG model, we evaluate (9), terminating the series at a point where additional terms are effectively zero.</p><p>It follows from the definition of a retention rate that</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S t = t i=0 r i (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where r 0 = 1. Coupling this with the expression for the (aggregate) retention rate under the sBG model (2) gives us a very easy way of evaluating the sBG survivor function.</p><p>Let us consider the task of computing DERL for one of the 6 480 Case 1 ( = 3 80 and = 15 20) customers who has made two contract renewals (i.e., has been active for n = 3 periods) in an Excel spreadsheet. With reference to Figure A.1, we first compute S t for t = 0 1 2 200 using ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) in column B. The conditional survivor function, the first-term of the summand in (9), is then computed in column D. The second term of the summand, the discount factor, is computed in column E. Summing up the product of the two terms (cell D1) gives us the value of DERL for a customer who has made two contract renewals (evaluated just before the point in time at which the third contract renewal decision is to be made); this is the number reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>.</p><p>Using this approach (and terminating the series after 200 terms) instead of using (6) underestimates the true value of DERL by 5.21E−12. While this error should be acceptable in most settings, it is far more convenient to use (6) when the modeling environment can evaluate the Gaussian hypergeometric function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>86</head><label></label><figDesc>Marketing Science 29(1), pp.85-93, © 2010 INFORMS    </figDesc></figure>
