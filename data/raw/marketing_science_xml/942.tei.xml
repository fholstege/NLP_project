<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There exists a sizable body of empirical research that deals with the estimation of purchase-timing decisions of households, using statistical models. These studies characterize households' temporal decisions of when to buy a particular product over time. A number of these studies use panel data to estimate the parameters of the purchase-timing model (for a recent study, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Seetharaman and Chintagunta 2003)</ref>. Early empirical studies, mostly in the sixties and seventies, modeled households' interpurchase times using statistical distributions such as Erlang-2, negative binomial, etc. (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chatfield and Goodhardt 1973)</ref>. Later studies, mostly in the eighties, modeled households' interpurchase times using econometric models-such as the logistic regression model-in order to account for the effects of marketing variables (such as price, advertising, etc.). A statistical model that is well suited to capture both of these features of purchase-timing data, i.e., intrinsic temporal purchase patterns (captured in the early statistical models such as the NBD) and the effects of marketing variables (captured in the later econometric models such as the Logit), is the Proportional Hazard Model, first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox (1972)</ref> and used in an extensive range of marketing applications over the past decade (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jain and Vilcassim 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Helsen and Schmittlein 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Wedel et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Chintagunta 1998</ref>).</p><p>In the Proportional Hazard Model (PHM henceforth), the construct of interest is a household's instantaneous probability of making a purchase in a product category, conditional on the elapsed time since the household's previous purchase in the product category. This conditional probability, also called the hazard function, is multiplicatively decomposed into two components: One, the baseline hazard captures the household's intrinsic temporal purchase pattern; two, the covariate function captures the influence of marketing variables. In other words, the baseline hazard characterizes the distribution of the household's interpurchase times after controlling for the effects of marketing variables. In the absence of marketing variables, suitable assumptions on the baseline hazard and unobserved heterogeneity across households in the PHM's parameters yield statistical purchase-timing models-such as the Erlang, NBD, CNBD, etc.-that have been extensively used to describe purchase-timing data for over three decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chatfield and Goodhardt 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Schmittlein and Morrison 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Wheat and Morrison 1990</ref>. Given its ability to handle time-varying covariates and nest traditional purchase-timing models as special cases, the PHM has become the most popular model to analyze interpurchase times of households.</p><p>In the past, researchers working with the PHM have tested a variety of parametric specifications for  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jain and Vilcassim (1991)</ref>. Another flexible specification is the Expo-Power specification, recently proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Saha and Hilton (1997)</ref> to study equipment failure times, and used in a purchase timing context by Seetharaman and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chintagunta (2003)</ref>. The weekly nature of households' shopping trips, coupled with the fact that not all shopping trips involve purchase of the product, has made the discrete-time version of the PHM (also called "Grouped PHM") more suitable for purchase-timing data than the continuous-time version (for an application of the discrete-time PHM, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Helsen and Schmittlein 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Despite extensive work on testing alternative specifications of the baseline hazard, no empirical study on purchase timing has tested alternative specifications of the covariate function. For example, the plausibility of the PHM's assumption that marketing variables influence purchase timing by acting in a multiplicative manner on the baseline hazard has never been empirically tested using data. An alternative specification of covariate effects is the Accelerated Failure Time Model (AFTM henceforth), in which marketing variables are allowed to directly influence the shape parameter of the baseline hazard <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chintagunta 1998)</ref>. A third possibility could be that marketing variables act on the baseline hazard in an additive manner (instead of a proportional manner as in the PHM, and a shape-shifting manner as in the AFTM). Such an assumption yields a purchase-timing model called the Additive Risk Model 1 (ARM henceforth), first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aalen (1980)</ref> and shown to be preferable to the PHM in several biological and epidemiology problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Breslow and Day 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Pocock et al. 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Buckley 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Pierce and Preston 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Breslow 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Thomas 1986</ref>). The ARM also handles time-varying covariates and nests traditional purchase-timing models-such as NBD, Erlang-2, etc.-as special cases. This study investigates whether the ARM is suitable for purchase-timing data and compares its empirical performance to that of the widely used PHM using scanner panel data on three product categories: laundry detergents, paper towels, and toilet tissue. As an additional benchmark, we also estimate the AFTM on the available purchase data and compare its performance to that of the ARM and PHM.</p><p>Our empirical findings are as follows: First, the ARM outperforms the PHM, which in turn outperforms the AFTM, in explaining observed purchases and in predicting holdout purchases of households; second, the estimated baseline hazards are quite similar between the ARM and PHM; third, the computed price elasticity is U-shaped over time under the ARM while it is time constant and severely understated (i.e., close to zero) under the PHM; fourth, the estimated parameters of the covariate function are very robust to alternative parametric specifications of the baseline hazard under the ARM, while they are highly sensitive to alternative baseline hazard specifications under the PHM.</p><p>Given the wide coverage given to the PHM in academic papers and text-books-such as <ref type="bibr">Prentice 1980, Lancaster 1990</ref> etc.-the paucity of coverage for the ARM in the academic literature is striking. We found only eight published papers on the ARM from the 1990s in the academic literature on theoretical and applied statistics <ref type="bibr">Wefelmeyer 1990, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huffer and McKeague 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henderson and Milner 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sasieni 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Henderson and Oman 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lin and Ying 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">McKeague and Sasieni 1994)</ref>. This is in sharp contrast to about a hundred papers that we found on the PHM over the same period of time. Given the excellent empirical performance of the ARM in the three datasets used in this study, we hope that this paper spurs more research interest on the ARM among purchasetiming researchers and encourages its adoption in other application areas as well.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we propose the ARM to study purchase timing, develop likelihood-based procedures to estimate the parameters of the ARM, and contrast the proposed ARM with the PHM and AFTM. In §3, we present our empirical findings. In §4, we conclude with a summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model Formulation and Estimation</head><p>Aalen's (1980) ARM specifies a household's instantaneous probability (also called the household's hazard function) of making a purchase in a product category, conditional on the elapsed time (t) since the household's previous purchase in the product category is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 h i t X t = h i t + i X t (1)</formula><p>where h i t X t stands for household i's hazard function at time t, X t is a row-vector of covariates (productspecific marketing variables such as price, display, and feature, and household-specific variables such as product inventory) facing household i at time t, h i t stands for household i's baseline hazard at time t, and i X t stands for household i's covariate function at time t. In this additive model, the baseline hazard represents the probability distribution characterizing the household's interpurchase times, and the covariate function shifts this baseline hazard up or down depending on the values of the covariates.</p><p>The following functional form is typically used to represent the covariate function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i X t = e X t i (2)</formula><p>where i stands for a column-vector of parameters corresponding to the covariates contained in X t . The choice of this functional form is dictated by the fact that the hazard function must always be nonnegative. This yields the following form of the ARM.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h t X t = h t + e X t (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where the subscript i has been dropped for nota-tional ease. One can also write the hazard function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h t X t = f t X t 1 − F t X t (4)</formula><p>where f t X t stands for the probability density function (pdf) corresponding to the household i's hazard function at time t, and F t X t stands for the corresponding cumulative distribution function (cdf). This equation can be understood as follows: While f t X t stands for the household's (unconditional) probability of buying the product at time t, 1 − F t X t stands for the probability that the household has not bought the product until time t. Combining Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">yields f t X t 1 − F t X t = h t + e X t (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where 1 − F t X t is also called the survivor function, i.e., the probability that the household "survives" a purchase until time t, represented by S t X t . Therefore, an alternative way of writing Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f t X t = h t + e X t * S t X t (6)</formula><p>In order to simplify Equation (5) into a more "estimation-friendly" form, we can rewrite it as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dF t X t 1 − F t X t = h t + e X t * dt (7)</formula><p>which is a first-order differential equation that can be solved as shown below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">F t X 0 dF u X u 1 − F u X u = t 0 h u + e X u * du (8)</formula><p>where the lower limit of integration (i.e., 0) corresponds to the time of the household's previous purchase in the product category. Solving this yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F t X t = 1 − e − t 0 h u +e X u du (9)</formula><p>which is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">S t X t = e − t 0 h u +e X u du (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>Substituting from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>) in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) yields the following estimable version of the continuoustime ARM.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f t X t = h t + e X t * e − t 0 h u +e X u du (11)</formula><p>where f t X t stands for the probability density associated with the purchase event that occurs at time t and covariate vector X t . There are a number of alternative parametric specifications that one can use for h t , such as exponential, Erlang-2, Weibull, log-logistic, log-normal, Gompertz, Raleigh, inverse-Gaussian, etc. Estimation of the parameters of the ARM at the individual level can proceed as follows: Suppose a household provides n interpurchasetime observations in the product category, say, (t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , t n . Each of these interpurchase times is associated with a covariate vector, yielding a stacked set of covariate vectors given by (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X n . The following likelihood function can be maximized to estimate the parameters of the ARM at the individual level.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L = n j=1 f t j − t j−1 X j (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where n stands for the total number of purchases made by the household in the product category, t j stands for the calendar time associated with purchase j, X j stands for the covariate vector at calendar time t j , and f • is given by Equation (11). It is clear from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">12</ref>) that this procedure computes the likelihood function based on a household's purchase observations only. However, a household undertakes shopping trips at discrete points of time, often weekly, which makes the household's purchase timing in a particular product category conditional on the household's discrete-time interval of shopping. To accommodate this, we rewrite Equation (10) in discrete time as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">S t X t = e t 0 h u du− t u=1 e X u (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where u is discrete time, measured in the time interval of shopping trips (usually weeks). In this formulation, the integral of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>) is replaced in part by a summation which is consistent with the empirical fact that marketing variables associated with a product category (contained in X t stay constant within a given week, but vary from one week to another. The household's probability of purchasing the product in discrete time t (since the previous purchase), also called the discrete-time hazard, is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Pr t X t = 1− S t X t S t −1 X t−1 = 1− e − t 0 h u du− t u=1 e X u e − t−1 0 h u du− t−1 u=1 e X u = 1−e − t t−1 h u du−e X t (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where Pr t X t stands for the probability that the purchase event will occur at discrete time t and covariate vector X t . Pr t X t is also called the discretetime hazard (as opposed to h t X t , which is called the continuous-time hazard). The following likelihood function can be maximized to estimate the parameters of the discrete-time ARM at the individual level.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L = T =1 Pr X * 1 − Pr X 1− (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where is an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if the product is purchased by the household at shopping trip and 0 otherwise, and Pr X is the household's probability of purchasing the product at shopping trip and is given by Equation (14). The discrete-time ARM, also called the grouped ARM, has been used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huffer and McKeague (1991)</ref> to analyze cancer mortality times among Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The discrete-time ARM is preferable to the continuous-time ARM because it explicitly accounts for nonpurchases. This is the model that we propose in this study. As regards the baseline hazard, h t , we use the log-logistic specification, which has been shown by <ref type="bibr">Seetharaman and Chintagunta (2002)</ref> to be empirically superior to alternative specifications for purchase-timing data. The log-logistic hazard is given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">h t = t −1 1 + t S t = 1 1 + t (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>where &gt; 0. This baseline hazard can be monotonically decreasing or inverted U-shaped (with a turning point at t = − 1 1/ / .</p><p>Last but not least, in order to avoid pooling bias in the parameter estimates of the baseline hazard and the covariate function, we allow the parameters of the model to follow a multivariate discrete distribution across households, whose locations and masses are estimated using the available data (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Heckman and Singer 1984)</ref>. Given below is the likelihood equation for such a heterogeneous ARM.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">L = H h=1 S s=1 s * T h j=1 Pr s X * 1 − Pr s X 1− (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where s stands for the probability mass associated with support s, T h stands for the number of shopping trips for household h, and Pr s • stands for the probability of the discrete-time ARM associated with support s and is given by Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">14</ref>). This completes our exposition of the proposed ARM for purchase-timing data. The likelihood equation, given in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">17</ref>), can be maximized using gradient-based techniques to obtain maximumlikelihood estimates of model parameters. Estimation involves the a priori specification of the number of supports S. While the optimal value of S is not directly estimable, we start with the homogeneous specification (i.e., S = 1) and keep adding supports until model fit stops improving (in terms of the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion). Next, we discuss two alternative models of purchase timing, which can be used as benchmarks for the proposed model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox's (1972)</ref> Proportional Hazard Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cox's (1972)</ref> PHM specifies the household's hazard function as follows: h t X t = h t * e X t (18)</p><p>In other words, the PHM says that the effect of the covariate function, e X t , on the baseline hazard, h t , is multiplicative rather than additive. This yields the following discrete-time PHM model:  where o is an intercept parameter and 1 is a vector of parameters capturing the influence of marketing variables on the baseline hazard. In other words, the AFTM is obtained from the log-logistic hazard of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">16</ref>) by allowing the parameter to be a linear function of marketing variables. We use this model as an additional benchmark for our proposed ARM.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Pr s t X t = 1 − e −e X</formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">h t = o + X t 1 o + X t 1 t −1 1 + o + X t 1 t S t = 1 1 + o + X t 1 t (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Results</head><p>We employ IRI's scanner panel data on household purchases in a metropolitan market in a large U.S. city. For our analysis, we pick three product categories: laundry detergents, paper towels, and toilet tissue. We believe that the "weak separability" assumption, i.e., the assumption that households' purchase decisions in a product category can be analyzed independently compared to their purchase decisions in other product categories in the store, is more reasonable for these product categories than for other product categories such as soup or soft drinks. This is because there are no obvious substitutes or complements for detergents or paper towels or toilet tissue, and these products can be considered necessities for most households. These datasets cover a period of two years from June 1991 to June 1993 and contain shopping trip information on 494 panelists across four different stores in an urban market. For each product category, the dataset contains information on marketing variables-price, in-store displays, and newspaper feature advertisements-at the stockkeeping-unit (SKU) level for each store/week.</p><p>Choosing households that bought at the two largest stores in the market (that collectively account for 90% of all shopping trips in the database) yields 488 households. From these households, we pick a random sample of 300 households making a total of 39,276 shopping trips at the two largest stores. For those shopping trips when a household does not purchase a particular product category, we compute marketing variables as share-weighted average values across all SKUs in the product category, where shares are household specific and computed using the observed purchases of the household over the study period. Such share weighting has precedence in the marketing literature on category purchase models (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chib et al. 2002)</ref>. Descriptive statistics pertaining to the marketing variables in the three product categories are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>. Detergents appear to be less displayed at the store and less advertised in the newspaper compared to paper towels and toilet tissue. Households make the largest number of purchases, and therefore have shortest interpurchase times, in the toilet tissue category. We plot the empirical distributions of observed interpurchase times in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The frequency distributions appear to have a mode close to one week (i.e., seven days) and are skewed to the left. Interestingly, the histograms show peaks in multiples of seven days. This is consistent with the empirical observation that households undertake shopping trips in weekly intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kahn and Schmittlein 1989)</ref>. The purpose of estimating the proposed ARM is to estimate the density functions associated with these histograms after accounting for the effects of marketing variables.</p><p>Given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2A</ref> are the results of fit comparisons between the proposed ARM and the benchmark models. In all three product categories, the proposed ARM is the best-fitting model, while the AFTM is the worst-fitting model. (Note: The three models have identical numbers of parameters.) Using a holdout sample of 63 households (whose purchase data are not used in the estimation), we compute validation  log-likelihoods based on the estimated parameters.</p><p>The results of such a validation comparison are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2B</ref>. Again, in all three product categories, the proposed ARM is observed to validate the holdout data better than the benchmark models. This establishes that the proposed ARM is preferable to existing models in terms of fitting and predicting observed purchase-timing outcomes. We plot the estimated log-logistic baseline hazard, i.e., 1 − S t /S t − 1 , in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The baseline hazard is observed to be nonmonotonic (i.e., inverted U-shaped) in both categories, peaking at about 10 days for towels under all three models. In detergents, however, the baseline hazard is observed to peak at about 20 days under the ARM and PHM, and at about 10 days under the AFTM. Overall, the shapes of the estimated baseline hazards are quite similar between model specifications, which suggests that one may not seriously misestimate the baseline hazard if one employed the less-predictive PHM or AFTM instead of the ARM. Our finding of a nonmonotonic baseline hazard is consistent with previous studies on purchase timing (for a review of previous studies, see <ref type="bibr">Seetharaman and Chintagunta 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> are the parameter estimates based on the three models for laundry detergents and paper towels (because the results from toilet tissue are qualitatively very similar, they have been suppressed for readability). One would expect the estimated display and feature parameters to have positive signs; i.e., if the product category is on display or feature, the household's expected likelihood of purchasing the product would be higher. This is true not only under the proposed ARM, but also under the PHM and AFTM. One would expect the estimated price parameter to have a negative sign, i.e., the higher the price of the product, the lower the household's expected likelihood of purchasing the product. This is true of all heterogeneity supports for the ARM and AFTM, but true of only one support (for both product categories) for the PHM. This suggests that one may misestimate the directional effects of price if one employed the PHM instead of the ARM. These findings can be interpreted in the light of findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">O'Neill (1986)</ref> that the use of the PHM when the true model is ARM can cause asymptotic bias in the estimated parameters of the covariate function.</p><p>In order to understand the substantive effects of the estimated price parameter, we compute a price elasticity measure based on an assumption of a 20% price cut from the regular price. Because the price elasticity measure is time dependent, we investigate the temporal pattern of price elasticity between the PHM, ARM, and AFTM. The results, presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, are quite striking. The price elasticity follows a U-shaped temporal pattern under the ARM, reaching a minimum at 15 days and 10 days, respectively, for detergents and towels, and mildly increasing thereafter. In contrast, the price elasticity measure is time constant under the PHM. More importantly, the price elasticity measure is severely understated, and close to zero, under the PHM. The AFTM, despite its inferior fit compared to the PHM, does a better job at recovering the price elasticity measure in that     it is both time varying (as under the ARM) and not as understated as under the PHM. Our explanation for the nonmonotonicity in the estimated price elasticity measure over time under the ARM (and AFTM) is the following: As time elapses since product purchase, the household runs out of product inventory at home, and it becomes less necessary for the product to offer a huge price cut in order to induce the household to purchase it. This leads to a decrease in the household's price elasticity over time. Simultaneously, as time elapses since product purchase, the product category becomes less "salient" in the consumer's mind and it takes a "shelf-talker" such as a price cut to get the consumer to remember and buy the product. These two countervailing forces on the household's price elasticity may be responsible for the observed nonmonotonicity in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, with the first force dominating in the first few weeks, and the second force dominating in later weeks. An alternative explanation for the estimated nonmonotonicity could be the effects of heterogeneous baseline hazards across households in the market, which makes aggregate price elasticities appear to be nonmonotonic even though the disaggregate price elasticities truly are not. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To investigate whether this aggregation explanation is at work, we look at the support-specific price elasticities themselves. These turn out to be nonmonotonic as well, which rules out the aggregation explanation.</p><p>In order to investigate the sensitivity of the estimated marketing mix parameters to the specification <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The authors thank an anonymous reviewer for proposing this alternative explanation. other baseline hazard specifications do not). While this clearly delineates the robustness of the price parameter estimates under the ARM to alternative baseline hazard specifications, it still begs the question of why estimates of the PHM are so tenuous. Investigating the statistical properties of the loglogistic PHM, and possibly the PHM in general, using numerical simulations, will throw light on this issue.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Observed Interpurchase TimesA.

The results of this exercise for detergents are given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. We find that the estimated effects of marketing variables under the ARM are remarkably robust to alternative parametric specifications of the baseline hazard.</p><p>Unlike the ARM, the estimated parameters of the covariate function in the PHM, however, are highly sensitive to the choice of the baseline hazard specification. To the extent that optimal pricing of the product depends on the estimated price elasticity, the tenuousness of the estimated price elasticity under the PHM would lead to poor pricing prescriptions for the retailer. This empirical finding is important to document given the widespread use of the PHM on purchase-timing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We adopt the Additive Risk Model (ARM), first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aalen (1980)</ref>, to analyze purchase-timing data. We compare the empirical performance of the proposed ARM with that of the Proportional Hazard Model (PHM) and the Accelerated Failure Time Model (AFTM), using scanner panel data on laundry detergents, paper towels, and toilet tissue. Our main findings are as follows: First, the proposed ARM fits and validates observed purchase outcomes better than the PHM and AFTM; second, the shape of the estimated baseline hazard is almost the same under the ARM, PHM, and AFTM; third, the estimated price elasticity under the ARM (and under the AFTM) is time varying, while the price elasticity under the PHM is constant over time and severely understated in magnitude (i.e., close to zero); fourth, the estimated price parameter of the ARM is robust, while the estimated price parameter of the PHM is highly sensitive to alternative parametric specifications of the baseline hazard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Issues for Future Research</head><p>While we have demonstrated the superior empirical performance of the ARM compared to the widely used PHM (as well as the relatively underused AFTM) in the context of interpurchase times, we encourage researchers working on other types of event times-such as time to employment, time to job turnover, etc.-to also estimate and investigate the empirical performance of the ARM. There are a number of important areas for future research: <ref type="bibr">4</ref> (1) It will be useful to investigate alternative functional forms for the covariate function within the ARM.</p><p>(2) It will be important to study whether a mixture of proportional, additive, and accelerated formulations of covariate effects is warranted in datasets that include several covariates.</p><p>(3) Investigating the analytical differences between the ARM and PHM is important to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of the two model formulations. This would require careful analysis of the mathematical and statistical properties of the two models.</p><p>(4) It is discomforting that the best-fitting PHM specification, i.e., the log-logistic, recovers incorrectly signed estimates of the price parameter for all three categories studied in this paper (even though the</p></div>			</div>
