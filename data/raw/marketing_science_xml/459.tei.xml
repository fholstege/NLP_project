<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A prominent challenge faced by empirical researchers in marketing, economics, and many other social sciences is endogenous regressors. Fundamentally, the problem arises because researchers are interested in questions of cause and effect, yet data in these disciplines are frequently obtained in nonexperimental settings. The most common form of this problem is correlation between regressors and random shocks. The canonical example arises in simultaneousequations models of supply and demand. Researchers are interested in estimating the slope of the demand curve. However, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are biased because both the supply and the demand schedules are influenced by common shocks. Similarly, if there are unmeasured product characteristics that influence consumer decisions but are not observed by the researcher, then while the marketer observes these and incorporates them into decision making, an endogeneity problem could arise <ref type="bibr">(Berry 1994, Villas-Boas and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Winer 1999)</ref>. Endogeneity problems also occur when there are omitted variables in a model of a causal relationship, such as the effect of schooling on wages (in this relationship, omitted variables may be motivation, ability, and socioeconomic status, which affect both schooling and wages), the impact of medical treatments on health, or the effect of social insurance programs on labor supply.</p><p>Three broad classes of solutions to the problem of endogenous regressors have been discussed in the literature. The textbook solution uses observed instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angrist and Krueger 2001</ref> provide a survey of the history). The ideal instrumental variable meets two requirements: it is correlated with the endogenous regressor through a relationship that the researcher can explain and validate, and it is uncorrelated with the error term. The theory of instrumental variables is well developed, but applied researchers face the critical practical problem that good instruments are very hard to find. The common prescription that good instruments come from detailed knowledge of the economic mechanism and institutions that determine the (endogenous) regressor of interest does not often help in practice. Even if an instrumental variable is available, it is often subject to potential pitfalls because it fails to meet the two requirements adequately. The most serious problem is the violation of the "exclusion restriction": the instrument should be uncorrelated with the error term in the structural equation of interest. Researchers routinely devote a great deal of effort toward convincing the reader that Park and Gupta: Handling Endogenous Regressors by Joint Estimation Using Copulas 568 Marketing Science 31(4), pp. 567-586, Â© 2012 INFORMS their assumed exclusion restriction is justifiable, but this claim is often debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Conley et al. 2012)</ref>. Note that this claim is impossible to test directly because of unobservability of the error.</p><p>Another important problem arises as a result of "weak instruments"-instruments that are insufficiently correlated with the endogenous regressors, which may result in biased estimates. In a landmark study of the effect of schooling on wages, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angrist and Krueger (1991)</ref> used census data with more than 329,000 observations and more than 180 instruments to find significant results, but they had small F -statistics from first-stage regressions of endogenous regressors on instruments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bound et al. (1995)</ref> reexamined <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angrist and Krueger's (1991)</ref> data and showed a finite sample bias even with the huge sample sizes. Further, in a rather dramatic demonstration of the problem of weak instruments, they replicated their results using random numbers as instruments. In fact, researchers sometimes have to worry if the "cure is worse than the disease"-is the bias caused by the use of weak instrumental variables worse than the bias caused by endogenous regressors?</p><p>The second class of solutions accomplishes correction of the endogeneity problem by supplementing the analysis with a supply-side model that explains observed realizations of the endogenous variables. Because these variables are often marketing variables, the model typically reflects firms' goal-directed behavior as theorized by the researcher. A number of examples of this approach are found in the marketing literature; a very partial list includes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yang et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dotson and Allenby (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Otter et al. (2011)</ref>. A specific case in this setting is that of slope endogeneity-namely, random coefficients being correlated with the explanatory variable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Manchanda et al. (2004)</ref> provides an example of dealing with slope endogeneity via a supply-side model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Yang et al. (2003)</ref> refer to this as a "full-information approach" because in all these cases the researcher needs to have prior knowledge or a theory of the process that generates the endogeneity. For instance, Yang et al. assume a particular game-theoretic model of price setting. The key concern with this approach is that incorrect specification of the supply-side model can lead to biased estimates of demand-side parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chintagunta et al. 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hartmann et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Hartmann et al. ( , p. 1081</ref>) note that "this approach is feasible only if full information is available to the analyst about how the firm allocates its marketing efforts. In the absence of such information, the analysis is sensitive to misspecification bias."</p><p>The third class of solutions to the endogeneity problem includes statistical approaches that require neither observed instruments nor specification of a supply-side model. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> These are sometimes called "instrument-free" approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ebbes et al. (2009)</ref> provide an excellent review and compares three extant instrument-free approaches: the higher moments (HM) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Erickson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Whited 2002, Lewbel 1997)</ref>, the identification through heteroscedasticity (IH) estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rigobon 2003, Hogan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rigobon 2003)</ref>, and the latent instrumental variables (LIV) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ebbes et al. 2005</ref>). In the HM approach, instruments are generated using the available data by exploiting higher-order moments. Similar to other method-ofmoments approaches, this method does not make strong assumptions about the distributions of variables. However, this method works under certain higher-order moment conditions that may or may not hold (e.g., the requirement that the second moments of the mean-centered dependent variable and a meancentered endogenous regressor are uncorrelated). The IH estimator also exploits the higher-order moments for model identification and is based on the methodof-moments approach. It requires researchers to have some information on heteroscedasticity: an observable grouping variable has to be available that describes the heteroscedastic error structure. However, such a variable may not always be available. The LIV method assumes that the endogenous regressor can be separated into an exogenous part and an endogenous part. The exogenous part is approximated using a latent discrete variable with a finite number of levels. Unlike the HM and IH methods, the LIV method is likelihood based. It does not require information on higher-order moment conditions or heteroscedasticity and thus is more generally applicable (see recent applications in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rutz and Trusov 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Rutz et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, and Zhang et al. 2009</ref>. In all three extant instrument-free approaches, the endogenous regressor P can be represented as P = f Z + , where f Z is treated as a random variable and unique structures are imposed on f Z for model identification. For instance, f Z is assumed to be discrete in the LIV method (leading to a latent class model), skewed in the HM method, and heteroscedastic in the IH method. These assumptions ensure the distribution of P to be different from that of the structural error and thus provide model identification. A key assumption of all three extant instrument-free approaches is that random variable f Z is exogenous. This assumption is similar to the 1 There are in addition a few published approaches that do not neatly fit into our classification. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hartmann et al. (2011)</ref> applied a regression discontinuity approach to handle the endogeneity problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bronnenberg and Mahajan (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">van Dijk et al. (2004)</ref> used spatial econometrics approaches to tackle endogeneity. However, these methods are context-specific and often also require detailed knowledge of the process that generates the endogeneity. There are two reasons for possible concern with the exogeneity assumption. First, in applications of instrument-free methods, researchers face a significant hurdle in arguing that the exclusion restriction is reasonable because they cannot observe f Z and do not know what it represents. Second, in some situations one could offer conceptual challenges to the exogeneity assumption based on context-specific knowledge. For instance, reasons for possible endogeneity of retail prices that have been discussed in the literature are manufacturer coupons, TV advertising, and retailer's strategic behavior (e.g., shelfspace allocation or special display), which are known to the retailer and consumer but unobserved by the researcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Besanko et al. 1998)</ref>; hence they are omitted variables in the demand model. Manufacturer coupons affect prices, and the latent discrete instrument variable in the LIV approach is then essentially capturing the presence versus absence of the coupon. The structural error in the demand model captures the omitted variables discussed previously. If manufacturers strategically plan both TV advertising and manufacturer coupons, or retailers allocate good shelf space for items with manufacturer coupons, then the latent discrete instrument variable might be correlated with the structural error and thus endogenous.</p><p>Our proposed method, which we describe next, falls into the third class of approaches for correcting for endogeneity; it is a statistical, instrumentfree method. We model the joint distribution of the endogenous regressor and the error term in the structural equation of interest (we refer to this as structural error) and make inferences on the model parameters by maximizing the likelihood from the joint distribution. We use a nonparametric density estimation method to build the marginal distribution function of the endogenous regressor. The suggested procedure allows the observed data to determine the marginal distribution flexibly and does not impose any restrictive assumptions on the stochastic behavior of the data. To build the joint distribution function of nonparametrically determined endogenous regressors and error terms in the structural equation, we use a copula method. Copulas are functions that join or "couple" multivariate distributions to their one-dimensional marginal distribution functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balakrishnan and Lai 2009)</ref>. In particular, using a Gaussian copula model, we construct a multivariate distribution that effectively captures the correlation between the regressor and the structural error. Once this correlation is properly handled, the proposed model does not suffer from the endogeneity problem, and we can obtain consistent estimates for model parameters.</p><p>Next we compare and contrast our proposed approach with extant instrument-free approaches. An important advantage of our proposed method is that it does not require the assumption of exogeneity of f Z because it directly addresses the correlation between P and the structural error using a copula. It only requires the distinctiveness between the distributions of P and the structural error, which is a requirement in other instrument-free methods as well. In Â§3.9, we illustrate this advantage of the proposed method in a simulation study.</p><p>We believe that among extant instrument-free methods, the LIV method is most closely related to our proposed method. Both the LIV and the proposed method assume that the structural error follows a normal distribution. If the endogenous regressor is also normally distributed, both models encounter difficulty in separating variation as a result of the endogenous regressor from variation due to the structural error; hence an identification problem arises. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> An important strength of the copula model is that it can capture the correlation between discrete variables and continuous variables. As a result, the proposed model can handle discrete endogenous regressors, a noteworthy advantage over the LIV and other instrumentfree methods. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can be used to handle the "slope endogeneity" problem that occurs when a regressor is correlated with its random coefficient. Researchers have typically used a "supply-side" model or instruments to tackle this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Manchanda et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Kuksov and Villas-Boas 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Luan and Sudhir 2010</ref>. As noted previously, supply-side approaches are subject to possible misspecification if the researcher does not have adequate knowledge of the process generating the endogeneity. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first statistical, instrument-free method to handle the slope endogeneity problem.</p><p>The method we propose is applicable both in linear models and in models that are nonlinear in variables and parameters. As an example of the latter, we apply the model to the random coefficient logit (RCL) model that has now become the workhorse of demand analysis in marketing and economics. We show that our proposed approach can be applied to correct for endogeneity when the RCL model is estimated using either individual-level or aggregate-level data. In simulation studies, we find that the proposed method provides unbiased and consistent estimates of model parameters, not only when the dependence structure between the endogenous regressor and the structural error is what the Gaussian copula assumes but also when this is not the case. That is, the proposed method Marketing Science 31(4), pp. 567-586, Â© 2012 INFORMS captures the dependence structure well enough to overcome the endogeneity problem. We also show that the proposed method is robust to misspecification of the distribution of the structural error. In an empirical application to paper towel sales data, we find that the proposed instrument-free method and the classical method using instrumental variables lead to essentially the same results on the endogeneity of retail price. This provides convergent validity to the proposed method. All in all, our results suggest that the proposed method handles the endogeneity problem well.</p><p>The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows. In Â§2, we explain the proposed method in detail. In Â§3, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in several simulation studies. In Â§4, we apply the proposed method to real marketing data. We conclude in Â§5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model and Estimation Procedure</head><p>We first present the proposed method in the context of the familiar linear regression model. We show how to handle multiple endogenous regressors and discrete endogenous regressors in Â§ Â§2.2 and 2.3, respectively. We then explain how the method can be applied in RCL models, to individual-level data in Â§2.4, and to aggregate-level data in Â§2.5. Finally, we explain how the slope endogeneity problem can be handled using the proposed method in Â§2.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Linear Regression Model</head><p>Consider the following linear regression model with an endogenous regressor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y t = X t + P t + t (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where t = 1 T indexes either time or crosssectional units, Y t is a 1 Ã 1 dependent variable, X t is a k Ã 1 vector of exogenous regressors, P t is a 1 Ã 1 continuous endogenous regressor, t is a structural error term, and and are model parameters. P t is correlated with t , and this correlation generates the endogeneity problem. To handle this problem, one can use instrumental variables that are correlated with P t but uncorrelated with t . The instrument equation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P t = Z t + t (2)</formula><p>where Z t is a l Ã 1 vector of instruments, is a l Ã 1 vector of parameters, and t is a random error term correlated with t . Two classical instrumental variables estimators are the two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator and the generalized methodof-moments (GMM) estimator. To obtain the TSLS estimator, in the first stage the endogenous regressor P t is regressed on Z t , and in the second stage predicted values of P t are plugged into (1) instead of P t .</p><p>The GMM estimator is based on the orthogonality condition between Z t and t . Neither of these methods imposes specific assumptions regarding the distribution of the error terms t and t . <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ebbes et al. (2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> i.e., the LIV method) and some other researchers make the assumption that t and t are jointly bivariate normal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chao and Phillips 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Kleibergen and Zivot 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Rossi et al. 2005</ref>.</p><p>Given "good" instrumental variables, one can obtain consistent estimates for the model parameters using TSLS, GMM, or other methods. However, even without instruments, one can obtain consistent estimates if the joint distribution of the endogenous regressor P t and the structural error term t is known. To illustrate this, let us assume that P t and t are generated from a certain bivariate distribution f p and researchers know this. Then, one can obtain consistent estimates of the model parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood function derived from f p . As this simple example illustrates, researchers can resort to the information in the joint distribution of the endogenous regressor and the structural error term instead of instrumental variables. The proposed method is based on this essential idea.</p><p>To implement the proposed method, researchers need to know the joint distribution of the endogenous regressors P t and the structural error term t , which is often unknown. To address this problem, we propose a unique copula model. In traditional multivariate distributions, once the parametric joint distribution function has been selected, the marginals are derived by integration. In other words, there is no flexibility for the marginals, and they are determined entirely by their parent joint multivariate distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Danaher and Smith 2011)</ref>. Thus, traditional multivariate distributions limit the choice of marginals for the endogenous regressor and the structural error term and can impose restrictive assumptions on the stochastic behavior of the observed data, resulting in biases. Copula models overcome these shortcomings of traditional multivariate models by starting from the marginals. In the proposed approach, using information contained in the observed data, we first select marginal distributions for the endogenous regressor and the structural error term, respectively. Then, the copula model enables us to construct a flexible multivariate joint distribution from the marginals, allowing a wide range of correlations between the two marginals.</p><p>We assume that the marginal distribution of the structural error term is normal. The normality assumption for the structural error seems reasonable and has been widely used in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Villas-Boas and Winer 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Yang et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Chao and Phillips 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Kleibergen and Zivot 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Rossi et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Ebbes et al. 2005</ref>). Of course, other assumptions are possible. For example, if a researcher believes that the actual error distribution may have thicker tails than the normal, Student's t-distribution can be used. In Â§3, we assess robustness of the proposed model to possible misspecification in this respect. We find that model estimates are fairly robust to violations of the distributional assumption of t .</p><p>We use nonparametric density estimation to identify the marginal distribution of the endogenous regressor P t . Unlike the structural error term, which is unobserved, we see sample data from the true distribution of P t . Nonparametric density estimation allows the data to speak for themselves in determining the density function, thus avoiding problems of distributional misspecification. Suppose we are given independent and identically distributed observations P 1 P T with the density function h p . The simplest nonparametric density estimator is a naÃ¯ve estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Silverman 1986</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">): h p = 1 T â¢ b T t=1 W p â P t b</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W x = 0 5 â¢ I x â¤ 1 , I</formula><p>â¢ is an indicator function, and b is the bandwidth parameter that determines the smoothness of the kernel estimator.</p><p>The larger the bandwidth, the smoother the density estimate. This estimator can be considered as a sum of "boxes" centered at the observations. Note that this estimator has some undesirable properties: h p is a step function and weights each observation inside the box equally. Because of these shortcomings, the kernel density estimator is preferred by many researchers. The kernel density estimator replaces W x , or "boxes," by smooth "bumps," or a kernel function K x , that is continuous and symmetric and satisfies K x = 1. One of the most commonly used kernel functions is the Epanechnikov kernel, and we use this kernel function in the proposed method. So the marginal density estimator for the endogenous regressor can be written aÅ</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h p = 1 T â¢ b T t=1 K p â P t b (3)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">K x = 0 75 â¢ 1 â x 2 â¢ I x â¤ 1 .</formula><p>Bandwidth selection is of crucial importance in density estimation, and various methods have been proposed in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Silverman (1986)</ref> has suggested a frequently used data-driven bandwidth b = 0 9 â¢ T â1/5 â¢ min s IQR/1 34 , where s is the sample standard deviation of the data and IQR is the interquartile range (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile). This rule is regarded as a good starting point (DiNardo and Tobias 2001), and we use this bandwidth in the proposed method. The kernel estimatorÄ¥ p can be shown to be consistent for h p if b goes to 0 at a suitable rate as the sample size T goes to infinity. Now we are ready to construct the joint distribution function from the marginal distributions of the endogenous regressor and the structural error term, denoted by H p and G , respectively. Also, let F p be a joint distribution function with marginals H p and G . Sklar's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sklar 1959)</ref> states that there exists a copula function C such that for all p and ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F p = C H p G = C U p U (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where U p = H p and U = G . This theorem is central to the theory of copulas and clarifies the role that copulas play in the relationship between multivariate distribution functions and their univariate marginals. Since H â¢ and G â¢ are marginal distribution functions, U p = H p and U = G are probability integral transformations, and thus U p and U are uniform(0, 1) random variables and the copula can be viewed as a function 0 1 2 â 0 1 . Now it becomes clear that the copula provides a way to study and model the scale-free dependence between variables after filtering out the influence of marginal distributions. Let f p denote the joint density function. Then, from (4), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f p = c U p U h p g (5)</formula><p>where c U p U = 2 C/ p and g is the marginal density function of the structural error.</p><p>In the statistics literature, various copula functions have been studied (see <ref type="bibr">Nelsen 2006 or Balakrishnan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Lai 2009)</ref>. In the proposed method, we use the Gaussian copula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C U p U = â1 U p â1 U = 1 2 1 â 2 1/2 â¢ â1 U p â â1 U â exp â s 2 â2 â¢ s â¢ t+t 2 2 1 â 2 ds dt (6)</formula><p>where denotes the univariate standard normal distribution function and denotes the bivariate standard normal distribution function with the correlation coefficient . If we let P * = â1 U p and * = â1 U , the Gaussian copula models P * * as the standard bivariate normal distribution with the correlation coefficient . The Gaussian copula is a general and robust copula for most applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Song 2000)</ref> and has many desirable properties (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Danaher and Smith 2011)</ref>. There are numerous applications of Gaussian copulas, particularly in hydrology and finance. Recently, Danaher and Smith applied the Marketing Science 31(4), pp. 567-586, Â© 2012 INFORMS Gaussian copula to multiple marketing data sets and showed that it performs better than existing probability models. In Â§3, we assess robustness of the Gaussian copula in capturing the dependence between the endogenous regressor and the structural error. From ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), we can write the joint density function of P t and t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f P t t = 1 1 â 2 1/2 exp â 2 â1 U p t 2 + â1 U t 2 2 1 â 2 + â1 U p t â1 U t 1 â 2 h P t g t (7)</formula><p>We can obtain consistent estimates by maximizing the following log-likelihood function, derived from ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), with respect to the model parameters = :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ln l P t t = â T 2 ln 1 â 2 â T t=1 2 â1 U P t 2 + â1 U t 2 2 1 â 2 â â1 U P t â1 U t 1 â 2 + ln 0 2 t (8)</formula><p>where 0 2 â¢ is the normal density with mean 0 and variance 2 . Note that the nonparametric density h p does not include any parameters and thus disappears from the log-likelihood function. However, it influences the log-likelihood function via U P t . By definition, U P t = H P t = P t â h x dx. To obtain U P t , we integrate the nonparametric density estimateÄ¥ p using a simple numerical method. 3 U t can be easily calculated from the normal distribution function. For the implementation of the proposed method in the simulation study and empirical application, we use the GAUSS package. Specifically, we use the quasi-Newton numerical optimization routines (the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method) for the maximization of the likelihood function.</p><p>The proposed copula model implies that P * * follows the standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient . This can be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P * t * t = 1 0 1 â 2 1 t 2 t</formula><p>3 Specifically, we use the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. This method works by constructing a grid on the integration variable and thus is easy to implement.

P * t can be obtained by transforming U P t using numerical integration of the nonparametric density estimatorÄ¥ p . Note that P * t corrects for the endogeneity bias and in this respect is similar to the "control function" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Heckman 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Hausman 1978</ref>).</p><p>As we explained in Â§1, the nonnormality of an endogenous regressor is required for the model identification. We can easily understand the role of nonnormality in model identification using (10). If P t follows a normal distribution, P * t is a linear transformation of P t since P * t = â1 H P t . Hence, we cannot separately identify and â¢ in (10). As the true distribution of P t approaches a normal distribution, the correlation between P t and P * t increases, causing a multicollinearity problem in (10). As is well known, multicollinearity does not create bias, only inefficiency. It appears that there is no simple remedy to this problem. If the standard errors of estimates are too large to draw meaningful conclusions, researchers might be able to mitigate this problem by increasing the sample size.</p><p>The inference procedure of the proposed method occurs in two stages. In the first stage, the density of the endogenous regressor is estimated using a nonparametric method, and then U P t or P * t are computed from the estimated density. In the second stage, computed U P t or P * t are used to construct the likelihood function, and the parameters are estimated. Here, computed U P t and P * t are the "generated regressors" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pagan 1984)</ref>. However, the usual standard errors of parameters based on the information matrix regard the generated regressors as the given observations, and thus the standard errors are incorrect. We propose a simple bootstrap method to compute the correct standard errors. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The bootstrap method is a sample reuse technique designed to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Efron 1979</ref>). To illustrate the method, from the original data with T observations, we draw T observations with replacement. Using these resampled data, estimate the model parameters and save them. This process is repeated many times. The bootstrap standard error is the sample standard deviation of the saved estimates. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Shih and Louis (1995) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Genest et al.

Thus, the proposed copula model does not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality problem," which is frequently encountered in nonparametric estimation of multivariate distribution functions. Further extension to more endogenous regressors is possible using a similar construction as in (12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Discrete Endogenous Regressor</head><p>Now assume that endogenous regressor P t is a discrete variable. The distribution function H â¢ is a step function, and we can define U p t to be related to the discrete variable P t through the following inequality: The proposed method decomposes the structural error into one that is correlated with the endogenous regressor and the other that is unrelated to the endogenous regressor by relying on the information contained in the distribution of the endogenous regressor. Therefore, the precision of the proposed method depends on the quality of information contained in the distribution of the endogenous regressor. Some commonly used discrete distributions in the marketing literature are the Poisson, the negative binomial, and the beta-binomial distribution. These have been employed to model, for instance, the number of exposures to a TV advertisement <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Rust 1986)</ref>. Although these distributions contain rich information, some discrete variables do not contain enough information to decompose the structural error into the correlated and uncorrelated parts. For example, a Bernoulli random variable has only two possible outcomes (0 and 1) and does not contain rich enough information. But as the support of the discrete variable increases, the performance of the proposed method improves quickly.

We briefly describe this model next. Let us specify an individual's latent utilities for choice alternatives as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">u h0t = h0t if no purchase, u hjt = X jt h + P jt h + jt + hjt = X jt Â¯ + b h + P jt Â¯ + a h + jt + hjt j = 1 J (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where t = 1 T denotes time, j denotes choice alternatives, and h = 1 H denotes individuals.</p><p>h0t and hjt are Type I extreme value errors, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">13</ref>) becomes a logit model. The structural error jt is correlated with P jt , and this correlation causes the endogeneity problem as in the linear regression case. jt is also referred to as "common shock" or "unmeasured product characteristic" in the literature. Consumers' heterogeneous preference is considered via a h and b h in the model. To estimate the model, we follow a two-step estimation method. The basic approach to handle the endogeneity problem remains the same as in the linear regression case. The second equation in (13) can be rewritten as follows: u hjt = X jtÂ¯ + P jtÂ¯ + jt + X jt b h + P jt a h + hjt = jt + X jt b h + P jt a h + hjt where jt = X jtÂ¯ + P jtÂ¯ + jt . jt is common to all individuals. We treat jt j=1 J t=1 T as parameters in the first step and estimate these along with the other parameters. Because we have individual-level data, the first step estimation is straightforward. jt are regarded as time-and alternative-specific fixed effects, and a simulation method is applied to handle random deviations a h and b h . Also, note that the endogeneity problem does not arise in the first stage because the endogenous regressor and the structural error are both encapsulated in jt . Let us denote the first-step estimates of jt asË jt = jt + jt , where jt is the estimation error, which is asymptotically normal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Random Coefficient Logit Model Using</head><p>Aggregate-Level Data The RCL model has been applied to aggregatelevel data by numerous researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chintagunta 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Sudhir 2001</ref>) beginning with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berry et al. (1995)</ref>. The utility specification for the RCL model with aggregate-level data is the same as (13). However, what we observe in the data is different. If individuallevel data are available, a researcher knows the actual choice of individual h at time t. Aggregate-level data add up individual-level outcomes to J Ã T market shares S jt = n jt /H, where n jt is the count of purchases for alternative j in time period t. Note that the twostep estimation of the previous section is no longer feasible because the number of first-step parameters is greater than the number of observations J Ã T . Let us assume that jt â¼ N 0 2 j and P * jt * jt follows the standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient j for j = 1 J . Then, as in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), jt can be written as j â¢ j â¢ P * jt + j â¢ 1 â 2 j â¢ 2 jt . Consequently, we can rewrite the second equation of (13) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">u hjt = X jt h + P jt h + j â¢ j â¢ P * jt + j â¢ 1 â 2 j â¢ 2 jt + hjt (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>2 jt is an independent and identically distributed random shock with a standard normal distribution and is uncorrelated with any other term in (15). Therefore, we can treat 2 jt as an additional error component and integrate it out of the demand function. P * jt can be obtained from U P jt using the numerical integration of the nonparametric density estimatorÄ¥ j p j , as we have explained in Â§2.1.

The likelihood function for the sample of T weeks becomes T t=1 L t . Monte Carlo simulation methods can be used to calculate the likelihood (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Keane 1993)</ref>, and the resulting estimator becomes a simulated maximum likelihood (SML) estimator. To be more specific, the integrals in the likelihood function can be calculated by taking averages of computed integrands using random normal draws for a h , b h , and 2 t . The main idea of this estimation scheme is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Park and Gupta's (2009)</ref> SML estimator, in which the authors decompose jt into an endogenous part and an exogenous part and account for the endogenous part using instrumental variables via control function and then integrate out the exogenous part. A critical differentiating advantage of our proposed method is that it does not require instruments, whereas Park and Gupta's SML does. One computational issue with the proposed SML is that the evaluation of the likelihood function may encounter numerical problems because Pr hjt 2 t a h b h a h b h d a h b h n jt in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) reaches machine 0 fairly quickly. If such a problem occurs, researchers can use a subsampling method. 6 2.6.

More importantly, we assume that t is correlated with P t . In the presence of correlation between coefficient and regressor, both the OLS estimator and the standard IV estimator are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Heckman 1976)</ref>, and this problem in estimation is referred to as "slope endogeneity." This problem occurs commonly in price discrimination situations in which the level of P t is strategically set based on the value of t . For example, assume that P t is price,Ë t represents price sensitivity, and t indexes geographic markets. The marketing manager of market t might use knowledge of price sensitivity of the market area to set market-specific prices.

Specifically, we consider the following copula models: (i) Ali-Mikhail-Haq distribution (with = 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">C U P t U t = U P t U t 1 â 1 â U P t 1 â U t (ii) Placket distribution (with = 20): C U P t U t = 1 + â 1 U P t + U t â 1 + â 1 U P t + U t 2 â 4U P t U t â 1 â¢ 2 â 1 â1</formula><p>(iii) Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern distribution (with = 1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">C U P t U t = U P t U t 1 + 1 â U P t 1 â U t</formula><p>(iv) Clayton copula (with = 2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">C U P t U t = U â P t + U â t â 1 â1/ (v) Frank copula (with = 2): C U P t U t = â 1 ln 1 + exp â U P t â 1 exp â U t â 1 exp â â 1</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the scatterplots of randomly generated U P t U t pairs from the above-mentioned copulas, as well as the Gaussian copula with the correlation coefficient 0.5. We can see that each copula generates a unique dependence structure between U p and U . After randomly generating U P t and U t from the above-mentioned copulas, we use the following process to generate P t and Y t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">t = G â1 U t = â1 U t (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">P t = H â1 U P t = â1 1 1 U P t (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_55">Y t = â¢ P t + t = â1 â¢ P t + t<label>(29)</label></formula><p>We set T = 200. For each copula, we generate 100 data sets and estimate the parameters using the OLS estimator and Proposed I (Proposed II yields the same results). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> reports estimation results. OLS estimates of are biased in all cases. By contrast, estimates from the proposed model are tightly distributed around the true values, and the bias is not significantly different from 0 in all cases. In summary, we find that the proposed method based on the Gaussian copula is robust to misspecification of the dependence structure between the endogenous regressor and the structural error. Our results echo findings about robustness of the Gaussian copula model that have been documented in the literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Song 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Danaher and Smith 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Balakrishnan and Lai 2009</ref>.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref> reports estimation results.

Both  estimators are biased, although the estimates from the proposed method are distributed nearer to the true value. As noted previously, this is because the support of the Bernoulli distribution is only 0 1 , and the information contained in this variable is not rich enough for the proposed method to handle the endogeneity problem properly. In Discrete 2, the support of the endogenous regressor expands to 0 1 2 3 4 , providing richer information. We observe that the OLS estimator is still biased, but the proposed method provides unbiased estimates for all three parameters. We find similar results in Discrete 3 (Poisson) and Discrete 4 (Negative binomial). To summarize, the proposed method shows good performance with discrete endogenous regressors if the support of the regressor is reasonably large.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.">Case 9: Comparison with LIV</head><p>The goal of this simulation is to compare the proposed copula method with the most similar extant instrument-free method, the LIV method. To briefly describe the LIV method, we reproduce Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>   The LIV method models Z t as a discrete, exogenous random variable with an unknown number of possible outcomes; t is an endogenous error and is usually assumed to be Gaussian. The endogeneity issue is handled by modeling the correlation between t and t . The finite mixture approach is used to estimate the model. Note that the LIV method is based on two key assumptions: Z t is a discrete variable and Z t is exogenous. Based on simulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ebbes et al. (2009)</ref> reported that the model successfully approximated some continuous Z t ; hence, the first assumption may not be overly restrictive. The second assumption or the exogeneity of Z t is similar to the exclusion restriction in usual IV models. In the LIV method, we do not observe Z t , and Z t is estimated using data. Therefore it is difficult to justify or test the exogeneity of Z t .</p><p>We generate data from an LIV model and compare the estimation performance of the copula and LIV methods. The specific DGP is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">ï£« ï£­ t t M t ï£¶ ï£¸ â¼ N ï£« ï£­ ï£® ï£° 0 0 0 ï£¹ ï£» ï£® ï£° 1 0 5 0 5 1 0 0 1 ï£¹ ï£» ï£¶ ï£¸ Z t = 0 if M t &lt; 0 4 if M t â¥ 0 P t = Z t + t Y t = P t + t = P t â¢ 1 + t</formula><p>We consider two different values for = 0 and = 0 5. When = 0, the latent instrument Z t is exogenous. In this case, the LIV method is correctly specified but the proposed method is not because the correlation between P t and t is different from what the Gaussian copula assumes. When = 0 5, the LIV method is misspecified because Z t is correlated with t . The proposed method continues to be misspecified because the correlation between P t and t is different from what the Gaussian copula assumes. In both cases, we generate 1,000 data sets with T =300. We estimate the LIV model assuming that the latent instrument has two categories. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref> shows the performance of OLS, LIV, and the proposed copula methods in estimating . When = 0, as expected, the OLS estimate is biased, and the LIV estimate is unbiased. Importantly, the proposed method yields unbiased estimates despite misspecification. When = 0 5, the OLS estimate continues to be biased. Importantly, the LIV estimate is also biased, whereas the estimate from the copula model is unbiased, supporting the flexibility of the proposed approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Application</head><p>We illustrate empirical application of the proposed method to handle price endogeneity in demand estimation using data on store-level sales of paper towels (category sales) in Eau Claire, Wisconsin over 260 weeks from 2001 to 2005. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The argument for endogeneity of retail price is that there are unmeasured product characteristics, or demand shocks, that influence not only consumer decisions but also retailer pricing decisions. Because they are unobserved by researchers, these variables are incorporated into the structural error, leading to the endogeneity problem. We focus on category sales in the two largest independent stores in the market (we refer to them as Stores 1 and 2). Retail price is defined on a per-roll basis. Retail price, in-store display, and feature advertising at the category level are computed as market share-weighted averages of UPC-level variables.</p><p>We use the TSLS estimator as a benchmark to assess the validity of the proposed method. To implement the TSLS model, we use retail price at the other store as an instrument (that is, Store 2 price is used as instrument for Store 1 price, and vice versa). Retail prices across stores in a market are likely to be highly correlated because competing retailers are typically offered the same wholesale prices for a brand. The Pearson correlation between the retail prices (category average) of paper towels at Stores 1 and 2 is 0.83. However, unmeasured product characteristics, especially those determined at retail (e.g., shelf-space allocation, shelf Store 1 log retail price Store 1 log sales location), are not likely to be systematically related to wholesale prices. If this is true, the instrumental variable is exogenous and thus is valid for controlling for the endogeneity of retail price.</p><p>We estimate the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">log Sales t = log Retail Price t â¢ + X t + t</formula><p>where the vector X t includes a constant, three dummy variables to represent quarters (Q2, Q3, and Q4), feature, and display. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows log sales and log retail prices at store 1 (Store 2 is very similar). The log retail price shows an increasing trend over the five-year sample period. Therefore, we use detrended log retail prices for estimation and also as instrumental variables. We estimate the model using the OLS estimator and also apply the two methods that correct for price endogeneity-the TSLS estimator and the proposed method. As we explained in Â§2, for the proposed approach, we first estimate the marginal distributions of prices using a nonparametric method and then use these distributions to construct the likelihood functions. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the nonparametric densities of detrended log retail prices at the two stores. We use the Epanechnikov kernel for the nonparametric density estimation. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Silverman's (1986)</ref> data-driven bandwidth selection rule, we set the bandwidth parameters to be equal to 0.036 and 0.039 for Stores 1 and 2, respectively. We can observe that both distributions are left-skewed and quite different from the normal distribution. Therefore, we expect that this difference will provide sufficient information for model identification. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">11</ref> reports estimation results for the three methods. Beginning with the results from Store 1, by comparing OLS estimates with TSLS estimates, we can verify whether prices are endogenous. The price coefficients are substantially different, supporting the case for retail price endogeneity. Also, the Hausman test for endogeneity <ref type="bibr">(Wooldridge 2001, p. 118</ref>) confirms that the retail price is endogenous. Instrumenting for retail price changes its coefficient estimate from â0 676 to â0 928, implying that there is a positive correlation between unmeasured product characteristics and the price. This direction of correlation is consistent with previous empirical findings (e.g., Villas-Boas and Winer 1999, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chintagunta et al. 2005</ref>   the proposed method are very close to those from TSLS. The estimate of is significant and positive, consistent with the TSLS finding of positive correlation between unmeasured product characteristics and the retail price. As we have observed in the simulation studies, the standard errors of the proposed method are slightly larger than those of TSLS but small enough for use to draw meaningful conclusion on model parameters. This implies that there is no problem in model identification in this case.</p><p>Unlike Store 1, the results from Store 2 provide multiple convergent indications that the retail price is exogenous. The OLS estimates are not significantly different from the TSLS estimates, the Hausman test of endogeneity confirms the conclusion, the estimates from the proposed method are not significantly different from the OLS estimates, and finally, the estimated value of is not significantly different from 0.</p><p>We interpret our results to mean that retailer pricing decisions are sensitive to changes in unmeasured product characteristics in Store 1 but less sensitive in Store 2. The convergence of results between TSLS and the proposed method in both stores lends validity to the proposed method to the extent that our assumption regarding exogeneity of the instruments is true.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We propose a new instrument-free method to handle the problem of endogenous regressors. Our method uses a Gaussian copula to model the joint distribution of the endogenous regressor and the structural error term, and it makes inferences on model parameters by maximizing the resulting likelihood function. We use flexible nonparametric density estimation to construct the marginal distribution of the endogenous regressor. In simulation studies we find that the proposed method provides consistent estimates not only when the actual correlation structure between the regressor and structural error follows what the Gaussian copula assumes but also when the correlation structure is different from what the Gaussian copula assumes. This finding supports robustness of the proposed method. We show how the proposed method can be applied to three popular models in marketing and economics-the linear regression model, the RCL model using individual-level data, and the RCL model using aggregate-level data. Also, we show how to extend the proposed method to (1) multiple endogenous regressors, (2) discrete endogenous regressors, and (3) slope endogeneity problems. In an empirical application to paper towel sales, we again find that the proposed method successfully overcomes the endogeneity bias.</p><p>The proposed method is not without limitations. The method exploits the information contained in the endogenous regressor for identification. For the proposed method to work properly, the distribution of the endogenous regressor must contain adequate information and must be different from that of the structural error (assumed to be normal). The former condition is violated when the endogenous regressor follows the Bernoulli distribution, and the latter is violated when the endogenous regressor follows the normal distribution. However, despite these limitations, we expect that the proposed method will provide a useful alternative in many empirical problems in which instruments are not available.</p></div>

(2009)</ref> reported a similar numerical problem when the number of individuals underlying the aggregate share is larger than about 500. To circumvent this numerical problem, they suggested a subsampling method that is conceptually similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Park and Gupta's (2009)</ref> approach.7  In the literature, this common type of endogeneity is referred to as "intercept endogeneity" in contrast to "slope endogeneity."</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">We also specified the triangular distribution and the Student's t-distribution for the marginal distribution of the structural error. Simulation results using these distributions echoed what we found with the uniform marginal: the proposed methods provided consistent estimates of the model parameters. Results are available from the authors upon request.</note>
