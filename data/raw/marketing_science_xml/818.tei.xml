<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Under pressure to increase their return on marketing investment through more astute targeting of resources, marketers are rediscovering the importance of social contagion. Recent "viral" and "network" marketing strategies often share two key assumptions: (1) some customers are more in touch with new developments than others, and (2) some (often, the same) customers' adoptions and opinions have a disproportionate influence on others' adoptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gladwell 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Moore 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Rosen 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Slywotzky and Shapiro 1993</ref>. Targeting those influential prospects who are more in touch with new developments and converting them into customers, the logic goes, allows marketers to benefit from a social multiplier effect on their marketing efforts. The two assumptions are quite reasonable, as they are consistent with several theories and a large body of empirical research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Katz and Lazarsfeld 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Rogers 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">, Weimann 1994</ref>, and the social multiplier logic cannot be faulted either (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Case et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Valente et al. 2003</ref>. However, marketing science provides little or no additional theoretical or descriptive insight into how new products diffuse in such markets. The reason is that the great majority of marketing diffusion models assume homogeneity rather than heterogeneity in the tendency to be in tune with new developments and the tendency to influence (or be influenced by) others. We address this gap between theory and emerging practice on the one hand, and marketing diffusion models on the other. Specifically, we model the aggregate-level diffusion path of a new product when the set of ultimate adopters is not homogeneous, but consists of two segments: influentials who are more in touch with new developments and who affect another segment of imitators whose own adoptions do not affect the influentials. We allow for the presence or absence of contagion among influentials and among imitators.</p><p>Many diffusion models incorporate the dual drivers of independent decision making affected by being in touch with new developments, and of imitation driven by others' prior adoptions, but they do so under the assumption that all potential adopters are ex ante equally affected by both factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Taga and Isii (1959)</ref> in statistics; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mansfield (1961)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pyatt (1964)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Williams (1972)</ref> in economics; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coleman (1964)</ref> in sociology; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bass (1969)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Massy et al. (1970)</ref> in marketing, all advanced a model specifying the rate at which actors who have not adopted yet do so at time t as h t = p + qF t , where F t is the proportion of ultimate adopters that have already adopted, parameter q captures social contagion, and parameter p captures the time-invariant tendency to adopt Van den Bulte and Joshi: New Product Diffusion with <ref type="bibr">Influentials and Imitators Marketing Science 26(3), pp. 400-421, © 2007 INFORMS 401</ref> early affected by consumer characteristics, the innovation's appeal, and efforts of change agents. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Because the proportion that adopts at time t can be written as f t = dF t /dt = h t 1 − F t ], one obtains:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f t = dF t /dt = p + qF t 1 − F t (1)</formula><p>The solution of this differential equation can be written as:</p><p>F t = 1 − e −g− p+q t / 1 + q/p e −g− p+q t</p><p>(2)</p><p>where g acts as a location parameter fixing the curve on the time axis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mansfield 1961)</ref>. When t = 0 corresponds to the actual launch time such that F 0 = 0, then g = 0 and Equation (2) reduces to the solution popular in marketing.</p><p>The rate is influenced by both the intrinsic tendency to adopt p and social contagion (q at all times except at t = 0 when qF 0 = 0. To reflect this dual influence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mahajan and Peterson (1985)</ref> refer to the model as the mixed-influence model. Because the rate contains no contagion pressure at t = 0, those adopting at that time are sometimes referred to as innovators and contrasted against all others adopting later, who are called imitators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bass 1969)</ref>. However, this terminology can only be used ex post, and the model does not represent a diffusion process in an ex ante mixture of two segments, the first adopting independently at rate p and the second adopting because of social contagion at rate qF t <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bemmaor 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Jeuland 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Lekvall and Wahlbin 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Manfredi et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Steffens and Murthy 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Tanny and Derzko 1988</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this study is to mathematically formalize prior theoretical arguments and research findings on social structure and diffusion, and to use this formalization to generate more refined theoretical insights on new product diffusion in a population of influentials and imitators. This is important because marketing practitioners increasingly deploy strategies assuming such a market structure, and because marketing researchers increasingly incorporate social structure into their diffusion investigations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bronnenberg and Mela 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Frenzen and Nakamoto 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Garber et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Godes and Mayzlin 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, Putsis et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Van den Bulte and Lilien 2001</ref>.</p><p>Our results offer formalized insights into current substantive and methodological research questions. First, diffusion in a mixture of influentials and imitators can exhibit a dip between the early and later parts of the diffusion curve. In contrast to what <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Moore (1991)</ref> claims, our model shows that it need not always be necessary for firms to change their product to gain traction among later adopters and the adoption curve to swing up again. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Steffens and Murthy (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Karmeshu and Goswami (2001)</ref>, but unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Goldenberg et al. (2002)</ref>, we obtain this result from a closed-form solution, and unlike those prior analyses, we show that a dip can occur even when influentials act independently from each other. Second, the proportion of adoptions stemming from influentials need not decrease monotonically, but may first decrease and then increase. The management implication is that while it may make sense to shift the focus of one's marketing efforts from influentials to imitators shortly after launch, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mahajan and Muller (1998)</ref> using a two-period model, one may want to revert one's focus back to influentials later in the process. Third, erroneously specifying a mixed-influence model to a two-segment process can generate the systematic changes in the parameter values over time reported in several studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Van den Bulte and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lilien 1997, Venkatesan et al. 2004)</ref>. This analytical result is a specific formalization of Van den Bulte and <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lilien's (1997)</ref> more general but qualitative argument that unaccounted heterogeneity in p or q can generate changes in these parameters' estimates as one extends the data window. Our result also complements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bemmaor and Lee's (2002)</ref> simulation analysis because we consider heterogeneity in a process with genuine contagion rather than in a Gamma/Shifted Gompertz process without contagion.</p><p>We also perform an empirical analysis and assess the descriptive performance of the two-segment model compared to that of the mixed-influence model and of three diffusion models incorporating heterogeneity in the form of a continuous rather than a discrete mixture. Given the difficulty of unambiguously identifying causal processes from aggregate diffusion data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bemmaor 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Hernes 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Lekvall and Wahlbin 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Lilien et al. 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004</ref>, the objective of this empirical analysis is not to conclusively demonstrate the validity of any model. Rather, it is to assess whether the differences between the discrete mixture and other models are sufficiently important to lead to differences in descriptive performance when applied to data of interest to marketing researchers. The twosegment model fits better than the mixed-influence, Gamma/Shifted Gompertz <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bemmaor 1994)</ref>, and Weibull-Gamma models <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hardie et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Massy et al. 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Narayanan 1992</ref>, especially in cases where Marketing Science 26(3), pp. 400-421, © 2007 INFORMS a two-segment structure is likely (or even known) to exist, and fits about as well as a recently advanced mixed-influence model where p and q vary across potential adopters in a continuous fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Karmeshu and Goswami 2001)</ref>.</p><p>We proceed by first outlining our model setting, and within that context, discuss five theories and frameworks that suggest the existence of ex ante influentials and imitators. Next, we develop a macro-level model of innovation diffusion in such a setting. Subsequently, we discuss how this model relates to the familiar mixed-influence model and to prior work on two-segment models. Finally, we report on the descriptive performance of the influential-imitator model compared to that of the mixed-influence and continuous-mixture models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theories Motivating a Two-Segment Structure of Influentials and Imitators</head><p>The situation we model is the following. The set of eventual adopters has a constant size M and consists of two a priori different types of actors, influentials and imitators. We use the subscripts 1 and 2 to denote each type, and the subscript m to denote the entire mixture population of adopters. We use to denote the proportion of Type 1 actors in the population of eventual adopters (0 ≤ ≤ 1), and F t to denote the cumulative penetration. Finally, w denotes the relative importance that imitators attach to influentials' versus other imitators' behavior (0 ≤ w ≤ 1). Each type's adoption behavior is then captured by the following hazard functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h 1 t = p 1 + q 1 F 1 t (3) h 2 t = p 2 + q 2 wF 1 t + 1 − w F 2 t (4)</formula><p>Note the asymmetry in the influence process: Type 1 may influence Type 2, but the reverse is not true. Because, ex ante, anyone of Type 1 may influence anyone of Type 2, we label the former influentials and the latter imitators. When p 2 = 0, contagion from influentials to imitators wq 2 &gt; 0 is critical for the diffusion process among the latter to get started. Obviously, when = 1 or = 0, everyone falls into a single segment and the situation reduces to the mixed-influence model (MIM). When 0 &lt; &lt; 1 but w = 0, the model reduces to two disconnected MIMs and, with further restrictions, to a model with two disconnected logistic or exponential functions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fader 2001, Perrin 1994)</ref>. Also, when imitators put equal weight on all prior adoptions regardless of origin, then we have h 2 t = p 2 + q 2 F m t , which implies w = (see §3). The distinction between influentials and imitators is based on what drives their adoption behavior, not on whether they adopt early or late. Hence, the distinction is different from that of innovators versus imitators in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bass (1969)</ref> and innovators versus early adopters versus early majority versus late majority versus laggards in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rogers (2003)</ref>. Conceptually, causal drivers and time of adoption need not map one-toone. Empirically, while those adopting early may act independently of others, and those adopting late may be subject to contagion, this is not always so: Many early adoptions may be driven by contagion, and the bulk of the late adoptions may stem from people not subject to social contagion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Coleman et al. 1966</ref>.</p><p>Several theories and conceptual models suggest such a two-segment structure, although there is some disagreement on whether q 1 and p 2 may be larger than zero. We first describe sociological arguments focusing on social character, social status, and social norms. We then turn to the two-step flow hypothesis, which focuses on interest in new developments, and finally to the chasm idea, which focuses on enthusiasm for innovations versus risk aversion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Social Character</head><p>In his classic treatise on the changing nature of modern society, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Riesman (1950)</ref> distinguished three types of social character: autonomous, inner directed, and other directed. The first two have in common the presence of clear-cut internalized goals, but differ as to whether these are consciously chosen (autonomous) or inculcated during youth by elders (inner directed). Other-directed actors, in contrast, use their peers as their source of direction. The typology is in essence about conformity stemming from the need for approval and direction from others. Riesman worked on a broad social and cultural canvas and his typology is best used to refer to patterns of behavior found in a variety of specific contexts rather than to types of persons or personalities. However, his concepts have direct relevance for consumer behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Riesman 1950</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Schor 1998</ref>. Some actors in some situations will exhibit autonomous or inner-directed adoption behavior independent from their peers (hence q 1 = 0), while others will exhibit other-directed behavior driven by social contagion from peers. Riesman did not narrowly specify who these peers are, and allowed them to be all of society (therefore w = being possible).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Status Competition and Maintenance</head><p>People buy and use products not only for functional purposes, but also to construct a social identity, and to confirm the existence and support the reproduction of social status differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bourdieu 1984)</ref>. A long-held idea in diffusion theory is that people seek to emulate the consumption behavior of their superiors and aspiration groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simmel 1971)</ref>, and also quickly pick up innovations adopted by others of similar status if they fear that such adoptions might undo the present status ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burt 1987)</ref>. In short, actors tend to imitate the adoptions of those of higher and similar social status.</p><p>Assuming one can divide the population into a high-status and a low-status group, status considerations suggest that both groups may exhibit contagion. Higher-status actors may imitate each other out of fear of falling behind q 1 ≥ 0 , and lower-status actors imitate to catch up. Whose adoptions the imitators act upon is not clear a priori. If they care only about adoptions by the high-status influentials, then w → 1. However, most authors follow Simmel and posit a finer-grained hierarchy with multiple strata (approximated imperfectly by a dichotomy) and a cascading pattern where all prior adoptions contribute equally to social contagion w = . Finally, to the extent that status is maintained by adhering to social norms enforced among one's direct peers of similar position, imitators should care mostly about fellow imitators w → 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Middle-Status Conformity</head><p>Like theories of status competition and maintenance, middle-status conformity theory is about one's proper place in society. The main claim is that the relationship between status and conformity to norms-and hence susceptibility to social contagion-is an inverted U (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Homans 1961, Philips and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zuckerman 2001)</ref>. Because high-status actors feel confident in their social acceptance, they feel comfortable in deviating from conventional behavior and adopt appealing innovations independently from others. Low-status actors feel free to deviate from accepted practice and adopt innovations independently as well, because they feel that this cannot hurt their already low status. Middlestatus actors, in contrast, feel insecure and strive to demonstrate their legitimacy by engaging in new practices only after they have been socially validated. Therefore, middle-status conformity theory is consistent with the presence of two kinds of actors, one adopting as a function of the innovation's appeal irrespective of others' actions q 1 = 0 , and one adopting as a function of the legitimation stemming from prior adoptions.</p><p>The theory does not specify whose adoptions are being imitated w . Adoptions by high-status actors might legitimate the innovation in the eyes of the middle-status actors disproportionately, in which case the relation of w to is unclear because the latter captures both high and low status. Conversely, imitators may care only about social acceptability among their middle-status peers, and hence care only about the latter's adoptions w = 0 . Finally, applications of neo-institutional theory to innovation adoption tend to posit that the legitimacy of an innovation is affected by the overall penetration rate w = .</p><p>Note that higher status is often associated with higher economic resources, and hence a higher ability to adopt innovations. This leads to the interesting prediction that only the adoptions at an intermediate stage of the overall diffusion process made by middle-status actors exhibit contagion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cancian 1979)</ref>, because the earliest adoptions will come from high-status actors and the latest from low-status actors, none of which are subject to contagion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Two-Step Flow</head><p>The two-step flow hypothesis, originally proposed to explain unexpectedly weak mass media effects in presidential elections, posits that "ideas often flow from radio and print to the opinion leaders and from them to the less active sections of the population" <ref type="bibr">(Lazarsfeld et al. 1944, p. 151, emphasis in original)</ref>. Therefore, in its original and starkest version, the two-step flow hypothesis posits two groups, one being affected only by mass media q 1 = 0 and the other being affected only by social contagion p 2 = 0 . What distinguishes the two groups is the level of interest in the subject matter and alertness to new developments rather than exposure to mass communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lazarsfeld et al. 1944)</ref>. Later studies in marketing have corroborated a strong relationship between opinion leadership and product interest and involvement (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Coulter et al. 2002, Myers and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robertson 1972)</ref>. Note that the twostep flow hypothesis does not require that an opinion leader in one sphere (politics, fashion, computer games, etc.) also be a leader in another sphere, and several studies indeed document only moderate to little overlap in leadership across product categories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Katz and Lazarsfeld 1955</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Merton 1949</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Myers and Robertson 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Silk 1966</ref>. Therefore, the relative size of the segments may vary across innovations. While early studies focused on information flows from opinion leaders to less active members of the population, subsequent research has documented extensive information exchange among opinion leaders (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Coulter et al. 2002, Katz and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lazarsfeld 1955)</ref>, consistent with q 1 &gt; 0.</p><p>The two-step flow hypothesis emphasizes the flow of information. The contagion mechanism is one of information transfer increasing awareness of the product's existence and decreasing its perceived risk, not of normative legitimation or status competition. Of the five theories we consider, this is perhaps the most flexible. For low-risk innovations, for instance, the fraction of imitators in need of guidance can be quite small, and quite large. Who is being imitated is not clearly specified, and w may range from zero to one. The original two-step flow idea emphasizes that mass media influence on the less-active segment operates through opinion leaders who are the only ones to take an active interest in information available in the media. It does so without constraining the social influence exerted on the less-active segment to come only from opinion leaders, and allows for a cascading or rolling pat-  a Parameter w denotes how much the social contagion affecting the imitators stems from the influentials w rather than fellow imitators 1−w . Parameter is the fraction of ultimate adopters belonging to Segment 1 (influentials).</p><p>tern through the population where all prior adoptions contribute to social contagion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Katz 1957</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Merton 1949</ref>. This suggests w ≈ . However, it is quite possible that opinion leaders are more influential, suggesting that-in the extreme case-they may be the only ones being imitated w = 1 . Conversely, it is also quite possible that imitators consider fellow imitators to be more representative, and hence valuable as information sources, suggesting low values of w.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">High-Technology Adoption Chasm</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Moore's (1991)</ref> chasm framework for technology products, the so-called early market consists of "technology enthusiasts" and "visionaries" who are quick to appreciate the nature and benefits of the innovation, whereas the mainstream market consists of more risk-averse decision makers and firms who fear being stuck with a technology that is not user friendly, poorly supported, or at risk of losing a standards war. Whereas the mainstream market can be represented as responding only to the size of the installed base, i.e., prior adoptions (Mahajan and Muller 1998), Moore is unclear about the process among technology enthusiasts and visionaries. Whereas his textual discussions suggest that they act independently q 1 = 0 , his stylized graph of the bell-shaped adoption curve with a chasm is mathematically inconsistent with a constant-hazard process in the early stages of diffusion, and requires q 1 &gt; 0. Note that for the chasm to be truly problematic, p 2 → 0 is required.</p><p>Moore does not clearly specify whose adoptions are being imitated w . On the one hand, one might argue that the legitimacy of a new technology is affected by the penetration rate in the overall population, i.e., the total installed base regardless of who adopted w = . On the other hand, Moore emphasizes that product and service offerings appealing to technology enthusiasts and visionaries need not appeal to the mainstream market, which implies that mainstream customers discount adoptions by technology enthusiasts and visionaries and care only about adoptions by other mainstream customers w = 0 . 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Conclusion</head><p>At least five different theoretical frameworks suggest modeling innovation diffusion using a two-segment structure consisting of influentials and imitators (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).

Also, several studies have documented that the majority of earliest adopters need not always be opinion leaders with disproportionate influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Weimann 1994)</ref>, implying p 1 &lt; 1 − p 2 and leaving p 1 &lt; p 2 as a possibility.

In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we plot the functions f m t , h m t , t , and t for three sets of parameter values chosen to illustrate various types of diffusion behavior possible in this model: <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Case (a): p 1 = 0 15, q 2 = 0 50, = 0 25, w = 0 25; Case (b): p 1 = 0 25, q 2 = 0 40, = 0 15, w = 0 01; Case (c): p 1 = 0 15, q 2 = 0 65, = 0 60, w = 0 05. Diffusion process (a) exhibits the common unimodal, symmetric-around-the-peak adoption curve f m t well captured by the mixed-influence model. More interesting is that the hazard function is not monotonic as in the mixed-influence model. Rather, it is roughly bell shaped and seems to converge to a value in-between the minimum and the maximum. Here is why. The very earliest adopters consist of independents, and the population hazard equals p 1 = 0 0375 at first. As more and more imitators adopt with hazard q 2 F m t , the population hazard increases. Once q 2 F m t &gt; p 1 , which can happen quickly when q 2 is markedly larger than p 1 , the set of imitators not having adopted yet will start depleting faster than the set of independents not having adopted yet. As a result, the laggards still remaining to adopt consist increasingly of independents-as indicated by the function t reaching a minimum around t = 5 and then increasing to 1-and the population hazard converges back to an asymptote of p 1 = 0 15. This pattern of relative speed of depletion also explains the nonmonotonic pattern in t , the proportion of adoptions taking place at time t stemming from independents. Note that in this diffusion process, independents make up the bulk not only of the early adopters, but also of the very late adopters. Importantly, the point at which t starts increasing and independents start gaining rather than losing importance t = 7 3 occurs when the process is still far from complete and the remaining market potential is still quite sizable (37% because F m t = 0 63 at t = 7 3).</p><p>Diffusion process (b) differs in several respects from process (a). First, the adoption curve f t does not have a smooth bell shape, but exhibits a clear dip early on. This is easily explained. The independents adopt rapidly because p 1 = 0 25 is rather high. However, imitators' reaction to those independent adoptions is very muted because they imitate mostly fellow imitators (w = 0 01). As a result, the adoptions by independents show an exponential decline that is not immediately compensated by the imitators' slowly developing adoptions, resulting in an early dip in the population curve. Note that independents account for the bulk of the adoptions only early in the diffusion process, as t declines steeply to close to zero. Therefore, while the adoption curve does not fit the standard model, we do have the commonly expected association between being an imitator and being a late adopter.</p><p>Diffusion process (c) looks mostly like an exponential-like process commonly observed for fastmoving consumer goods, CDs and films, but with a marked boost after the early periods. What is happening is that most adopters are independents = 60% , so the majority of adoptions follow an exponential decline. However, there is also a sizable segment of imitators that are very sensitive to social contagion (q 2 = 0 65), but mostly from fellow imitators rather than independents w = 0 05 . As a result, the imitators are slow to adopt at first, but once the snowball starts rolling, tend to adopt in a very short time. This is reflected in the shape of t : The proportion of adoptions accounted for by independents tends to be close to 100%, except for a relatively narrow time window during which it first declines and then increases </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">π(t) φ(t) f (t) h(t) π(t) φ(t) f (t) h(t) π(t) φ(t)</formula><p>again. The contrast between process (a) and (c) is informative: They have similar p 1 and q 2 values, and the composition of both adopters t and remaining nonadopters t tend to evolve similarly, as do their respective population hazard functions h t . However, because of the different segment sizes and con-tagion weights w in the two processes, the resulting adoption curves are quite different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Some Special Cases of Theoretical Interest</head><p>Our review of prior theories and frameworks indicates that three cases of the social influence struc-ture captured by w are of special theoretical interest.</p><p>The first is where imitators imitate only influentials w = 1 , such that h 2 t = p 2 + q 2 F 1 t . <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The second is where imitators imitate only other imitators w = 0 , such that h 2 t = p 2 + q 2 F 2 t . The third is where imitators mix randomly with both independents and imitators, such that w = and h 2 t = p 2 + q 2 F m t . In the first and third case, F 2 t and f 2 t are easily derived by imposing w = 1 and w = , respectively, in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">12</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">14</ref>), and (17). The second case poses an issue when p 2 = 0 and the process among imitators is only a function of prior adoptions by other imitators:</p><p>The process is then simply the well-known logistic process, which does not allow for F 2 0 = 0. 10 A fourth case of special interest is less obvious: When all independents adopt instantaneously with p 1 → and pure imitators p 2 = 0 have a very specific influence weight w = 1 + q 2 − /q 2 &gt; , then the PTM reduces to the MIM (see Technical Appendix A).  . Two exceptions to this are the case where p 1 = 0 or = 0 and both models collapse to the logistic model, and the case where q 2 = 0 or = 1 and both models collapse to the exponential model. A third, less obvious, exception is when p 1 → and w = 1+q 2 − /q 2 &gt; , and the PTM also reduces to the MIM.</p><p>Our analysis allows one to assess the widely accepted notion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mahajan et al. 1993</ref>) that rewriting the standard differential equation for the mixed influence model (Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_21">)) into f t = p 1 − F t + qF t 1 − F t (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>allows one to interpret the term p 1 − F t as the number of adoptions made by people adopting with hazard p; and the term qF t 1 − F t as the number of adoptions made by people adopting with hazard qF t . While the manipulation of the equation is evidently correct, the interpretation is not. The main reason is that, in each term, the fraction of actors not having adopted yet, 1 − F t , refers to the total population, rather than to the fractions in each of the segments, 1 − F 1 t and 1 − F 2 t . In addition, the sizes of each segment are ignored. The correct expression for a mixture is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">f m t = f 1 t + 1 − f 2 t = h 1 t 1 − F 1 t + 1 − h 2 t 1 − F 2 t = p 1 1 − F 1 t + 1 − q 2 • wF 1 t + 1 − w F 2 t 1 − F 2 t (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>When imitators randomly mix with independents and imitators and are equally affected by both, then w = and the equation simplifies to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">f m t = p 1 1 − F 1 t + 1 − q 2 F m t 1 − F 2 t (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">Even if p = p 1 , q = 1 − q 2</formula><p>, and one omits the m-subscript from the population-level f m t and F m t , the mixture Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">20</ref>) is different from the mixedinfluence Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">18</ref>). Within a homogeneous population with mixed influence, one can only interpret the relative size of the two terms p 1 − F t and qF t 1 − F t as reflecting the relative influence of time-invariant elements p versus social contagion qF t on the adoptions at time t, keeping in mind that each and every adoption is influenced by both p and qF t for any t &gt; 0. For instance, the ratio p/ p + qF t can be used as a measure of the relative strength of time-invariant elements at time t <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lekvall and Wahlbin 1973)</ref>, as can the decomposition presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Daley (1967)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mahajan et al. (1990)</ref>, but neither can be interpreted as the fraction of all adoptions at time t stemming from pure-type actors adopting a priori with hazard p.</p><p>Another common belief about the mixed-influence model that is inconsistent with its mathematical structure is that "the importance of innovators will be greater at first but will diminish monotonically with time," where innovators are defined as those who "are not influenced in the timing of their initial purchase by the number of people who have already bought the product" <ref type="bibr">(Bass 1969, p. 217)</ref>. In a homogeneous population where everyone behaves according to the hazard rate p + qF t , the only actors with hazard p are those adopting at t = 0 when F 0 = 0. Anyone adopting afterwards is influenced by prior adoptions. Hence, in the mixed-influence model, the proportion of adoptions occurring at time t that are unaffected by social contagion follows a step function with value 1 at t = 0 and value 0 for any t &gt; 0. Conversely, in a mixture with p 1 , the proportion of independents adopting with a constant hazard, i.e., function t , need not diminish monotonically over time, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Consequence of Imposing a Mixed-Influence</head><p>Structure on a Pure-Type Mixture Process From comparing Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">20</ref>), one may get the impression that a diffusion process in a discrete mixture with h 1 t = p 1 and h 2 t = q 2 F m t could be approximated quite well by a mixed-influence model with h t = p + qF t , even if they are not identical. However, the adoption functions f m t and hazard functions h m t suggest some potentially important deviations. More insight comes from rewriting the expression for f m t in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">20</ref>) into a form similar to that for f t in the mixed-influenced model (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Manfredi et al. 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">f m t = p 1 1 − F 1 t + 1 − q 2 F m t 1 − F 2 t = p 1 1−F 1 t 1−F m t + 1− q 2 F m t 1−F 2 t 1−F m t 1−F m t = p t + q t F m t 1 − F m t (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">p t = 1 − F 1 t 1 − F m t p 1 = t p 1 (22) q t = 1 − 1 − F 2 t 1 − F m t q 2 = 1 − t q 2 (23)</formula><p>Deleting the m subscript from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">21</ref>) to reflect one's ignoring that the population consists of a mixture results in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">f t = p t + q t F t 1 − F t (24)</formula><p>Therefore, one is able to rewrite the pure-type mixture model with w = into an expression akin to the mixed-influence model, but with both hazard-rate parameters varying systematically over time. More specifically, p t changes in exactly the same way as t , the proportion of actors not having adopted yet by time t that belong to the segment of independents. At t = 0, t = and p t = p 1 . Because at the very beginning adoption tends to be more prevalent among independents than among imitators, the number of independents who have not adopted yet gets depleted faster than the number of imitators who have not. Consequently, t and p t decline at first. However, when q 2 p 1 , the relative speed of adoption between the two segments quickly reverses and the set of actors who have not adopted yet tends to become increasingly dominated by independents. As a result, t and p t increase over most of the time window. The reverse pattern takes place for q t = In short, specifying a mixed-influence model with h t = p + qF t when the true data-generating process is that of a discrete mixture with h 1 t = p 1 and h 2 t = q 2 F m t where q 2 p 1 will yield increasing values of p and decreasing values of q (except for the first very few periods). This is consistent with the pattern in mixed-influence model estimates described in prior research. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Van den Bulte and Lilien (1997)</ref> focused their analysis on ill-conditioning in the absence of model misspecification, they recognized that unobserved heterogeneity in p and q forms an alternative explanation for the systematic changes they observed in empirical applications.

The latter is based on X t = MF m t (absent error) and F m t = F 1 t + 1 − F 2 t . We allow the error term t ∼ N 0 2 to exhibit serial correlation up to order 2 when the time series contains more than 20 observations or the Durbin-Watson statistic falls outside the 1.5-2.5 range. We impose the contraint that hazard parameters p 1 , q 1 , p 2 , and q 2 be nonnegative (≥0) and that 0 ≤ ≤ 1. Because hazard rates can be larger than one in continuous time, we do not impose p 1 , q 1 , p 2 , and q 2 ≤ 1. As to w, we impose 0 01% ≤ w ≤ 1, choosing a very small but positive lower bound so the model itself ensures the "seeding" of the contagion process among imitators even when p 2 = 0. Because estimation through direct integration fits the cumulative adoptions X t rather than the periodic adoptions X t − X t − 1 , the R 2 values are often extremely high and noninformative (the lowest we obtained was 0.992, and several were higher than 0.9995).

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> reports the results of estimating the AIM to all 33 data series. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Values for p 1 tend be smaller than 0.3. There are two exceptions to this: Foreign Language, where is so low that f m 0 = p 1 equals only 0.04, and the Beastie Boys CD that exhibited an extreme "blockbuster" pattern, i.e., extremely quickly declining sales. Values for q 1 show much more variance. This is especially so for CDs. For about half of them, q 1 equals zero, indicating the absence of word of mouth among influentials. In six cases, q 1 is larger than one, suggesting very strong word of mouth among influentials. However, these large estimates are very imprecise, and only two are significant at 95% confidence. Values for p 2 are most often zero, and only four of the 33 estimates are significantly different from zero. Values for q 2 also show considerable variance, with several high values recorded for the set of miscellaneous innovations. The latter may result from the strong left skew in the adoption time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bemmaor and Lee 2002)</ref>.

That is often larger than 2.5% or 16%, traditional values used to separate innovators from imitators based on time of adoption, is an indication-in addition to the t function-that the dichotomy based on drivers of adoption underlying the model is conceptually different from that based on time of adoption. The MAPE and R 2 p values indicate that the model tracks the data well. While the MAPE is higher than 10% for some of the shorter data series, like the 15% value for scanners in small hospitals with 50-99 beds, such high MAPE values can be misleading because they tend to result from a few deviations early in the process when the base for calculating the percentage error is small. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that the model can indeed track bimodal patterns rather well even with a high MAPE.</p><p>Because combining nonlinear least-squares estimation with direct integration may be new to marketing (diffusion) researchers, we briefly report, for the case of tetracycline, estimates obtained through direct integration (DI) with those obtained through the popular Srinivasan-Mason (SM) procedure fitting the difference in closed-form cdfs to the difference in cumulative adoptions. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> clearly show that both procedures produce very similar estimates for the PTM and the MIM. Direct integration has somewhat higher serial correlation because it fits the cumulative adoptions X t rather than the periodic adoptions X t − X t − 1 . The difference in the dependent variable also explains why direct integration produces much lower MAPE values even when the mean squared error (MSE) values are very similar. That the DI method leads to lower R 2 p values than the SM method is not surprising, because the latter method finds those estimates that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE), and hence maximizes  # AR1, AR2 = first-order and second-order serial correlation; DW = Durbin-Watson statistic; for estimation on cumulative data using direct integration (DI), R 2 p = r 2 of actual adoptions with difference in predicted cumulative adoptions; for estimation on periodic data using SM-method, R 2 p = r 2 of actual and predicted adoptions. * Boundary constraint. a p ≤ 0 05; b p ≤ 0 001; for and w , the entry left of the slash (/) refers to the significance of the test against zero and those to the right refer to the test against one.</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">M p 1 q 1 p 2 q 2 w AR1 AR2 DW MSE MAPE R 2 p AIM</formula><p>the correlation between predicted and observed periodic adoptions. The parameter estimates of the AIM and PTM, with the zero value of q 1 meaning that Segment 1 consists of independents, and the high value of meaning that contagion affected only a minority, are consistent with previous analyses using individual-level data on adoption times and actual network structure <ref type="bibr">(Coleman et al. 1966, Van den Bulte and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lilien 2003)</ref>, as is the decomposition of total adoptions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>. The graph indicates that by Month 11, when 25% of all physicians still had to adopt, all imitators had already adopted and the "laggards" consisted only of independents. This is consistent with the original finding by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coleman et al. (1966)</ref> using individual-level data that the laggards tended to be very poorly integrated in the social network, and hence unaffected by social influence. Finally, the mixture models generate an estimate of M close to the entire sample of physicians (N = 125), whereas the mixed-influence estimates are very close to the number of adopters having adopted at the end of the observation period (X t 17 = 109). This is consistent with our analytical result that imposing a mixedinfluence model on a mixture process can generate the kinds of estimation artifacts documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Van den Bulte and Lilien (1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Descriptive Performance Compared to</head><p>Benchmark Models To assess the descriptive performance of the two-segment model, we compare it against that of the mixedinfluence (MIM), Gamma/Shifted Gompertz (G/SG), Weibull-Gamma (WG), and Karmeshu-Goswami (KG) models. Because all of these benchmark models have a closed-form solution, we estimate them using the standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Srinivasan-Mason (1986)</ref> approach. To avoid having comparisons across model specifications be affected by differences in estimation method and dependent variable, we do not estimate the full AIM using the DI approach.

Still, the question remains to what extent serial correlation alone helps close the gap between two models.</p><p>We use four measures of descriptive performance: mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Note that only the latter two penalize models with a larger number of free parameters. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> To save space and aid interpretation, we report only the ratio of the baseline models' MSE and MAD to that of the two-segment model. This relative measure controls for differences across data series in their total variance, with one being the neutral value and higher values indicating superior fit of the two-segment model. To save space, we report only the difference in BIC and MAPE, with zero being the neutral value and higher values indicating superior fit of the two-segment model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> reports the performance indicators averaged for each of the four sets of data as well as for all 33 data series. Technical Appendix C reports results for the individual series. The first panel pertains to models with additive i.i.d. errors. Let us start by focusing on the BIC, where a three-point difference is large enough to be evidence of superior fit and a 10-point difference provides strong to very strong evidence of superior fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Raftery 1995)</ref>. The two-segment model fits markedly better than the MIM, G/SG, and WG models for tetracycline, music CDs, and hightech products, but not for the miscellaneous products where the presumption of a discrete mixture is not strong a priori. The two-segment model fits about equally as well as the continuous-mixture KG model, except for tetracycline, where it beats it by a sizable margin. The same pattern exists for the other three performance measures: The two-segment model fits markedly better than MIM, G/SG, and WG for data where a two-segment structure is a priori likely, but not elsewhere; and the two-segment model fits about equally as well as the Karmeshu-Goswami model in all data sets.</p><p>Turning our attention to the second panel in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>, we see that allowing for serial correlation in the more poorly specified models tends to somewhat narrow the gap with the two-segment model. However, the performance gap for products where a two-segment structure is a priori likely does not vanish. For high-technology products, adding serial correlation even increases the gap in BIC and MSE vis-à-vis MIM, G/SG, and WG. The results in the third panel of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> indicate that using a multiplicative rather than additive error structure does not affect the main conclusion from the first two panels very much: The two-segment model fits about as well as the continuous-mixture KG model, and markedly better than the MIM, G/SG, and WG models for new products for which a two-segment structure is a priori likely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have analyzed the diffusion of innovations in markets with two segments: influentials who are more in touch with new developments and who affect another segment of imitators whose own adoptions do not affect the influentials. Such a structure with asymmetric influence is consistent with several theories in sociology and diffusion research, including the classic two-step flow hypothesis and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Moore's (1991)</ref> more recent technology adoption framework. Our model allows diffusion researchers to operationalize these theories without recourse to micro-level diffusion data and to estimate parameters from real data. There are four main results.  # To save space and aid interpretation, we report only the relative fit performance by comparing the fit of the two-segment discrete mixture model against that of the alternative models. For BIC and MAPE, we report the alternative models' value minus that of the two-segment model. For MSE and MAD, we report the alternative models' value divided by that of the two-segment model. Therefore, for the BIC and MAPE differences, the neutral value is zero; for the MSE and MAD ratios, it is one. For all metrics, higher values indicate superior fit of the two-segment model. For the BIC and MAPE differences, the average values reported are arithmetic means. For the MSE and MAD ratios, they are geometric means because this is a better measure of the central tendency of a ratio than the arithmetic mean.</p><p>(1) Diffusion in a mixture of influentials and imitators can exhibit the traditional symmetric-around-thepeak bell shape, asymmetric bell shapes, as well as a dip or "chasm" between the early and later parts of the diffusion curve. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Moore's (1991)</ref> contention, the model suggests that it need not always be necessary to change the product to gain traction among later adopters and for the adoption curve to swing up again. Tetracycline is an example.</p><p>(2) The proportion of adoptions stemming from independents need not decrease monotonically; it can also first decline and then rise again to unity. This result disproves a common contention among diffusion researchers based on an erroneous mixture interpretation of the mixed-influence model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bass 1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Mahajan et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Rogers 2003</ref>.</p><p>(3) Specifying a mixed-influence model to a mixture process with pure independents and pure imitators can generate systematic changes in the parameter values. As several authors have noted, diffusion within a pure-type mixture of independents and imitators with hazards p and qF t , respectively, is distinct from diffusion in a homogeneous population with mixedinfluence, where everyone adopts with hazard p + qF t . The closed-form solutions we present not only prove this mathematically, but also show that imposing a mixed-influence specification on a pure-type mixture process can generate the systematic changes in the parameter values reported by Van den Bulte and <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Lilien (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bemmaor and Lee (2002)</ref>, and Van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Bulte and Stremersch (2004)</ref>, unless is close to either zero or one, or unless p 1 → and pure imitators (p 2 = 0) have a very specific influence weight w = 1 + q 2 − /q 2 &gt; .</p><p>(4) Empirical analysis of four sets of data comprising a total of 33 different data series (the classic Medical Innovation data, 19 music CDs, five high-tech products, and eight miscellaneous innovations) indicates that the two-segment model fits markedly better than the MIM, the G/SG, and the WG models, at least for innovations for which a two-segment structure is likely to exist. Hence, the model does better when it is theoretically expected to, and does not when it is not theoretically expected to. The two-segment model fits about equally well as the mixed-influence model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Karmeshu and Goswami (2001)</ref>, where p and q vary in a continuous fashion. Overall, the findings on descriptive performance are robust to changes in the error structure and indicate that the discrete-mixture model is sufficiently different and the data sufficiently informative for the model to fit real data better than other models.</p><p>The model we presented provides sharper insight into how social structure can affect macro-level diffusion patterns, and should prove useful in five areas of application where influentials and imitators are a priori likely to exist. The first two are high-technology and health care products, including pharmaceuticals. In these two areas, innovations are often perceived to be complex or risky, and mainstream imitators refuse to be on the "bleeding edge," unlike opinion leaders and lead users. The third area is that of entertainment and mass culture products like gaming software, music, books, and movies, where the distinction between aficionados and the casual mainstream audience can loom large. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Teen marketing is the fourth area where the distinction between influentials and imitators may be critical in the new product diffusion process. For several years, P&amp;G has been operating Tremor as a mechanism to connect with highly involved and influential teens, encourage adoption among them, and through them reach out to the larger teen population. Categories in which Tremor and similar services have been used include not only fashionoriented apparel and entertainment, but also more mundane fast-moving consumer goods like beauty aids and food. The fifth area of particular potential consists of situations where a segment of enthusiasts has pent-up demand. For instance, when Internet access providers started operating in France in 1996, a rather large number of people adopted their services. New adoptions dipped in 1997, only to increase again from 1998 onwards. The deviation from the standard bell shape was not the low number in 1997, but the high initial number in 1996, when many university users who had been accessing the Internet exclusively through the university RENATER network were finally able to start using the Internet at home as well <ref type="bibr">(Fornerino 2003)</ref>. In cases where enthusiasts can place advance orders that the marketing analyst can observe (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moe and Fader 2002)</ref>, it may be useful to explicitly allow for a difference between the start time of the diffusion process of the two segments. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Explicitly allowing for influentials and imitators may be especially useful for products carried by characters, writers, actors, or directors who already have a small following among aficionados, but have not yet broken through to the mainstream. In such cases, one would expect the former to adopt according to an independent process and the latter to adopt only through contagion, if at all. This might result in a temporary dip. Movies starring Christina Ricci and movies directed by Ang Lee exhibit this pattern. Early in her career, Ricci played in several independent movies that won critical acclaim and earned her the label of "Indie Queen." These early movies exhibited the bell curve typical of very successful "sleepers" (The Ice <ref type="bibr">Storm-1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, The Opposite of Sex-1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Buffalo 66-1998</ref>. Then followed a small movie exhibiting a dip (Desert Blue-1998), while her recent movies are more standard Hollywood fare exhibiting the standard monotonic, exponential decline (e.g., The Man Who Cried-2001). The same pattern is observed for movies directed by Ang Lee: bell-shaped for The Ice Storm-1997, a temporary dip for Ride with the Devil-1999, and monotonic decline for his more recent Hollywood production, The Hulk-2003.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Implications for Practice</head><p>The first two of our results have clear managerial implications. Because dips in the adoption curve can stem from the mere presence of influentials and imitators, it need not always be necessary for firms to change their product to gain traction among later adopters and for the adoption curve to swing up again. In contrast to what <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Moore (1991)</ref> claims, launching a new version to appeal to prospects who have not yet adopted need not always be necessary, let alone optimal, to get out of the dip. Of course, when the dip results not from a social chasm between segments (very low w but from a difference in what constitutes an acceptable product offering, changing the product will be necessary to gain traction in the second segment.</p><p>We have also shown that the proportion of adoptions stemming from influentials need not decrease monotonically; it can also first decline and then rise again. Hence, while it may make sense for firms to shift the focus of their marketing efforts from independents to imitators shortly after launch as shown by Mahajan and Muller (1998) using a twoperiod model, they may want to start increasing their resource allocation to independent decision makers again later in the process. Managers who confuse the distinction between influentials and imitators with that between early and late adopters, and ignore our results and others' empirical evidence that the bulk of the late adoptions may stem from people not subject to social contagion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Coleman et al. 1966</ref>, may end up wasting money by poor targeting.</p><p>Both of these prescriptive implications assume the existence of influentials and imitators. Of course, thoughtful managers will want to check these assumptions against data from their own markets to assess to what extent they should trust these implications. Standard aggregate-level data and models can be quite misleading for identifying a causal mechanism affecting new product diffusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bemmaor 1994, Van den Bulte and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Stremersch 2004)</ref>. Managers and market researchers must realize that disaggregate data are necessary to gain a better understanding of whether and how social contagion drives the diffusion of their products (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Burt 1987, Van den Bulte and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lilien 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Our work also has important implications for how managers should develop more effective network marketing efforts. Several firms in the pharmaceutical industry, longtime leaders in applying marketing analytics, are now conducting research in which they ask physicians to name the opinion leaders in their social network. Typically, firms use this information to guide their sales reps to the more central physicians. In terms of our model, they are allocating their resources to make F 1 t grow faster, in the hope that this will get F 2 t growing faster as well through the Marketing Science 26(3), pp. 400-421, © 2007 INFORMS social multiplier effect captured by wq 2 . This makes sense, but should be complemented with efforts to increase the multiplier, especially the weight factor w. Rather than focusing only on identifying and converting influentials, firms should also identify ways to increase their impact (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Valente et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The limited value of aggregate-level data to detect contagion effects does not mean that nothing can be learned from them. Following the lead of studies like that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hahn et al. (1994)</ref>, firms could analyze the sales evolution of multiple products and look for systematic differences in parameters like , w, and q 2 that can be related to product or market characteristics. This, in turn, may help firms develop a better understanding of why product sales evolve the way they do, and might even result in better forecasting models. Such analysis should be useful in all five areas of application identified earlier. From a data availability point of view, it should be particularly appealing to firms in the book, music, and film industries who launch many products each year, and to consulting and research firms with many clients in pharmaceuticals or in high-tech industries.</p></div>
