<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The past ten years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of Bayesian methods in marketing. Bayesian analyses have been conducted over a wide range of marketing problems from new product introduction to pricing, and with a wide variety of different data sources. Bayesian methods are particularly appropriate to the decision orientation of marketing problems. While the conceptual appeal of Bayesian methods has long been recognized, the recent popularity stems from computational and modeling breakthroughs that have made Bayesian methods attractive for many marketing problems. In this paper, we will outline the basic advantages of the Bayesian approach, explain how hierarchical Bayes models are ideally suited to many marketing data sets and decisions, and outline the nature of the computational revolution. Throughout, we will emphasize the importance of a decision orientation that we believe is an important aspect of marketing as a field.</p><p>Until the mid-1980s, Bayesian methods appeared to be impractical because the class of models for which the posterior could be computed were no larger than the class of models for which exact sampling results were available. Moreover, the Bayes approach does require assessment of a prior, which some feel to be an extra cost. Simulation methods, in particular, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, have freed us from computational constraints for a very wide class of models. MCMC methods are ideally suited for models built from a sequence of conditional distributions, often called hierarchical models. Bayesian hierarchical models offer tremendous flexibility and modularity and are particularly useful for marketing problems as discussed below.</p><p>While Bayesian methods have risen to prominence in many fields, this review will emphasize a perspective on the use of Bayes methods that stems from a basic marketing paradigm. Fundamental to this perspective is the notion that customers are different in their preferences for products and that firms must explicitly take this into account in determining optimal marketing actions. It is useful, therefore, to view statistical analysis as comprised of three components:</p><p>1. within-unit behavior (the conditional likelihood); 2. across-unit behavior (the distribution of heterogeneity);</p><p>3. action (the solution to a decision problem involving a loss function).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAYESIAN STATISTICS AND MARKETING</head><p>We will see how the Bayesian approach provides a unified treatment of all three components.</p><p>We will follow these three steps as the outline of the paper, and conclude the paper with a discussion of open issues and directions for future research. We have also included Annotated Citations of Bayesian Applications in Marketing in Appendix 1, which contains a list of published or accepted papers of the last ten years that tackle marketing problems using Bayesian methods. The annotations provide a brief description of the paper and how it relates to the topics discussed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Bayesian Essentials</head><p>In this section, we introduce our notation for the Bayesian paradigm, and comment on the important distinctions between classical and Bayesian approaches. We feel that these distinctions are underappreciated by researchers in marketing. We do not attempt to provide a primer for Bayesian inference. For those interested in an introduction to Bayesian inference and modern Bayesian computing methods, there are many excellent texts, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bernardo and Smith (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gelman et al. (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Robert and Casella (1999)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Liu (2001)</ref>.</p><p>All Bayesian analysis starts with the specification of the data-generating mechanism or the distribution of the data y, given the unobservable parameters , p y . Viewed as a function of the parameters, this distribution is sometimes called the likelihood function, l = p y . The Bayesian, therefore, subscribes to the likelihood principle that states that the likelihood function contains all relevant information regarding the model parameters. In addition, a probability distribution representing prior beliefs about is required, p . Bayes theorem provides the updating mechanism for how prior beliefs are translated into posterior (or after the data) beliefs. p y = p y p p y ∝ p y p p y is called the posterior distribution and reflects both the prior beliefs, as well as sample information.</p><p>We note, immediately, that the posterior is a conditional distribution that conditions on the data. This provides a marked contrast to the sampling theoretic view in which we consider the data random, and we investigate the behavior of test statistics or estimators over imaginary samples from p y . The Bayesian would regard the sampling distribution as irrelevant to the problem of inference because it considers events y that have not occurred. Inference is the problem of making statements about the unobservables conditional on the data.</p><p>Since the posterior distribution can be a highdimensional object, investigators typically summarize the posterior in terms of some lower dimensional summary statistics. Typically, the posterior mean E = p y d is used as an estimator and the posterior standard deviation is used as a measure of precision. Both of these quantities are the integrals of specific functions of the parameter vector, E y h . Other important examples include: (i) Aspects of the marginal distribution of one element or a subset of the vector; (ii) posterior probabilities of intervals or regions of the parameter space (such as the posterior probability that a price coefficient is negative); and (iii) predictive distributions of the data, p y f y = p y f p y d . Thus, the Bayesian investigator is faced with the problem of computing a multidimensional integral of the posterior distribution. Methods for computing these integrals are at the core of the recent revolution in computing for Bayesian statistics.</p><p>The Bayesian framework is compelling in the sense that it provides a unified approach to modeling, incorporation of prior information, and inference. Inference here refers to making a posteriori statements about all unobservables including both parameters and, as yet unrealized, data (prediction). Bayesian inference adheres to the likelihood principle and is conducted using formal rules of probability theory. This means that, under mild conditions, Bayes estimators are consistent, asymptotically efficient, and admissible. As a practical matter, Bayesian inference is free from the use of asymptotic approximations and delivers exact, finite sample inference. This is particularly important in nonlinear models and models with discrete data. The intuition developed for regression models of the sample size required for asymptotic sampling theory to be accurate does not carry over well to many of the models used with marketing data. In particular, choice models may require extremely large (as much as 1,000 observations per parameter) samples to insure the adequacy of asymptotic approximations <ref type="bibr">(cf. McCulloch and Rossi 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In general, Bayesian methods provide a better approximation to the level of uncertainty or, conversely, the amount of information provided by the model and the data than other approaches. For example, consider two-step procedures in which a subset of parameters are estimated in the first stage, then the second stage estimates the remaining parameters, conditional on the first subset. Parameter uncertainty is difficult to account for in multistage analyses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lenk and DeSarbo (2000)</ref> provide an example of how a full Bayesian procedure outperforms an approximate two-step procedure for clustering problems. Parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty are particularly important considerations in optimal decision theory. Optimal decision making should take into account uncertainty to avoid the problem of "overconfidence" (see <ref type="bibr">Montgomery and Bradlow 1999)</ref>. Bayesian decision theory provides a unified approach to inference, model choice, and uncertainty as discussed in §6 of this paper</p><p>The advantages of Bayesian inference are not obtained without a cost, however. The Bayesian approach is likelihood-based and requires a prior. Some have criticized Bayesian methods as relying on "subjective" prior information. It is important to note that the basis of prior information can also be "objective" or data-based. In addition, all modeling assumptions are a form of prior information. The advantage of the Bayesian approach is that all prior assumptions are explicitly stated. Adherence to the principles of scientific inquiry does not rule out the use of subjective information but, rather, the specification of explicit and replicable procedures. It should be noted that in the practical domain of marketing, methods that make full use of prior information are required for reliable inference because information about unknown quantities is hard to come by. Prior information from experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sandor and Wedel 2001)</ref>, theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Montgomery and Rossi 1999)</ref>, or other datasets <ref type="bibr">(Lenk and Rao 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Putler et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Kamakura and Wedel 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Wedel and Pieters 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Ansari et al. 2000a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Ter Hofstede et al. 2002</ref>) is important to marketing problems. Classical inference procedures are silent on how to incorporate information from sources other than the data. Some contend that specification of the likelihood function is another drawback of the Bayesian approach. For some models, evaluation of the likelihood can be computationally demanding. In other situations, the investigator may be concerned with model specification error induced by specifying an inappropriate likelihood. Recent developments in statistical computing have opened up the possibility of analyzing likelihood functions once thought to be computationally intractable. Regarding prior and likelihood specification, we recommend that the investigator perform sensitivity analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MCMC Simulation Methods</head><p>The general computational problem facing Bayesians is the computation of various integrals of functions with respect to the posterior distribution. Since these integrals can be written as the posterior expectation of a function of the parameters, simulation methods seem natural candidates for approximation. For example, if we could make i.i.d. draws from the posterior we could simply approximate the integrals by the sample mean</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I = E y h = h p y d Î = 1/R R r=1 h r</formula><p>If draws from the posterior are available at low computational cost, we could simply use a very large sample to approximate I to any desired degree of accuracy. However, the general problem of drawing from an arbitrary multivariate distribution is extremely difficult and there is no computationally feasible general method. Instead of using i.i.d. draws, another approach could be to construct a Markov chain with the posterior as its stationary or equilibrium distribution. In practice, this means specifying a transition density that produces a sequence of draws. r is a draw ROSSI AND ALLENBY Bayesian Statistics and Marketing from p r r−1 given 0 . If p y is the stationary distribution of this Markov chain, then we can simply iterate the chain long enough to dissipate the effects of the initial condition and then save these draws to evaluateÎ. While these draws are no longer i.i.d. (they will exhibit some form of autocorrelation in most cases), laws of large numbers still apply and we can approximate I to any desired degree of accuracy. The use of a Markov chain to develop a simulation-based estimate of I has been termed a MCMC method (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Robert and Casella 1999</ref> for a comprehensive discussion of these methods, and Chib 2003 for an excellent overview). The usefulness of the MCMC idea depends on three criteria:</p><p>(i) the ability to construct chains for arbitrary posterior distributions;</p><p>(ii) the ability of the chain to quickly converge to the equilibrium distribution and not to exhibit highly autocorrelated or near nonstationary behavior;</p><p>(iii) ease of drawing from the transition density of the chain.</p><p>The class of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms provide a set of methods for constructing Markov chains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Tierney (1994)</ref> shows that under very mild conditions (mostly that the posterior density is positive everywhere in the parameter space), the Metropolis-Hastings style methods will converge at a geometric rate to the unique equilibrium distribution that will be the posterior. One particularly useful member of the Metropolis-Hastings class is the so-called Gibbs sampler. The Gibbs sampler is dependent on the ability to draw from various conditional distributions of the joint posterior. Partition the vector into K subvectors, = 1 K , and consider the conditional distributions p k k −k y , where −k refers to the elements of , other than the kth element. If it is possible to draw from these conditional distributions, then the Markov chain that can be constructed by cycling through these conditional distributions has the posterior as its invariant distribution. That is, to draw r r−1 , we cycle through each of the K conditionals</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p 1 r 1 r−1 2 r−1 3 r−1 K y p 2 r 2 r 1 r−1 3 r−1 K y p K r K r 1 r 2 r K−1 y</formula><p>The sequence of draws converges in distribution to the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters, p 1 K y . In addition, draws from the posterior distribution for any one parameter,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p i y = p 1 K y d −i</formula><p>is obtained by simply discarding the draws of parameters not of interest. For example, the posterior mean of p i y can be estimated from the sample mean of the i draws.</p><p>Many models can be expressed such in a way that these various conditionals are available in closedform and from well-known distributions that are easy to sample from. For example, single and groups of linear regressions fall into this class. In addition, data augmentation allows standard probit models to be sampled using the Gibbs sampler. Today most work is being done with models that no longer have a simple Gibbs sampler. However, the modular or conditional setup of the Gibbs sampler is frequently exploited. Typically, some sort of hybrid approach is used, in which Gibbs-style draws are combined with "Metropolis"-style draws.</p><p>It is possible to define a Metropolis-Hastings style MCMC algorithm for many models, including highly nonlinear models or models defined in high dimensions. These algorithms, however, must be investigated closely to insure that they navigate freely through the parameter space and reach the regions of high posterior probability. It is possible to stop a slowly navigating chain and conclude that the posterior is very tight when, in fact, the algorithm is moving too slowly. We recommend that investigators simulate data to investigate performance of the MCMC algorithm. Independence Metropolis or random walk Metropolis algorithms must have properly chosen candidate sampling distributions in order to function well in high-dimensional parameter spaces. We recommend that investigators check these methods against the slower, but more reliable, one-by-one Griddy Gibbs methods.</p><p>In summary, MCMC methods are now available to handle inference in a wide class of models. MCMC methods are particularly well-suited to models which are built from a hierarchy of conditional distributions. One very important example is random coefficient models, discussed below. Perhaps, more importantly, the modularity of the hierarchical modeling approaches, that dovetails so well with MCMC methods, has enlarged the class of priors and likelihoods available for use in marketing applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Within-Unit Analysis: Likelihoods and Marketing Data</head><p>Marketing is concerned with understanding and reacting to the behavior of individual consumers. Decisions are ultimately made at a disaggregate level, although for some types of decisions (e.g., setting store prices) an aggregate-level analysis is acceptable. We note that it is always possible to derive aggregate predictions of actions by integrating over the distribution of heterogeneity. Our discussion, therefore, focuses on data and models assuming that the unit of analysis is an individual respondent, consumer, or household.</p><p>Marketing data is sparse at the individual-unit level. In scanner panels of household purchases, for example, it is rare to have more than 20 observations per household in most product categories. Each observation is a vector response corresponding to the quantity purchased of a particular offering. The most frequent response value is zero, indicating no purchase of the offering, and the second most frequent response is one, indicating that one unit of the good is purchased. Responses also take on integer values in surveys where respondents are asked to choose between discrete alternatives, to rank order objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bradlow and Fader 2001)</ref>, and to provide responses on five-and seven-point scales. Marketing data are typically very lumpy, and are not well-suited to standard distributional assumptions (e.g., normal, gamma, Poisson).</p><p>Latent variable models are often used to explain marketing data. A latent variable model typically assumes that there exists an unobserved continuous variable and a censoring mechanism that gives rise to the discrete outcome. In an economic model of choice between near-perfect substitutes, for example, consumers are assumed to select the offering with greatest value, measured as the ratio of marginal util-ity to price. In the analysis of survey response data, it is sometimes convenient to assume that responses on a fixed-point (e.g., five-and seven-point) scale are a censored realization of a latent, continuous variable. Finally, in the analysis of multiple response data (i.e., pick any of J data), each element of the vector of multivariate binomial responses can be thought of as being equal to one if a latent variable surpasses a threshold, and equal to zero if the latent variable is less than the threshold value.</p><p>The advantage of a latent variable approach to modeling marketing data is that it provides a flexible approach to specifying the likelihood function that is consistent with the observed, lumpy data <ref type="bibr">(Rossi et al. 2001, Marshall and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Bradlow 2002)</ref>. Models for the latent utility can be continuous even though the range of the observed dependent variable is discrete. Many useful models can be constructed starting from an underlying multivariate normal regression model</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">z = X + ∼ N 0</formula><p>Here, z is a m × 1 vector, which is multivariate normal conditional on x. The latent vector, z, is censored via some function which is not a function of the model parameters, . Examples include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Tobit Model: m = 1, y = 0, z &lt; 0, y = z, z ≥ 0 Ordered Probit: m = 1, y = r, c r−1 ≤ z &lt; c r , r = 1 R, c 0 = − c R = Multinomial Probit (MNP): y = j, z j = max z 1 z m Multivariate Probit: y j = 1, z j &gt; 0; else y j = 0</formula><p>These four examples illustrate the flexibility of the latent framework. The Tobit model produces a discrete-continuous distribution for y given x that has a lump of probability at zero (the no-purchase option, for example). The ordered probit can be applied to ratings data in which the respondent provides ratings on a ratings scale. The MNP probit model is a very flexible general model that accommodates situations in which choices are made from a set of m alternatives. Finally, the multivariate probit model can be used in situations such as the pick j from J alternatives or where binary choice is made in different time periods or categories of products.</p><p>Latent variable models can often be given an economic interpretation as a random utility model. Consider, for example, the MNP model. If consumers have ROSSI AND ALLENBY Bayesian Statistics and Marketing linear utility and can only choose one alternative, the utility-maximizing choice is the choice for which the ratio of marginal utility to price is the highest;</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y = j if U j /p j = max U i /p i</formula><p>where U i is the marginal utility of choice i. In the random utility model, marginal utilities are not fully observable. We only observe various attributes of the choice that are represented in the x vector. If ln U i = V i + i and i ∼ N 0 , then the model becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y = j if V j − ln p j + j = max i V i − ln p i + i</formula><p>This is a special case of the MNP model. The error terms have the interpretation as the unobservable factors influencing marginal utility. The random utility approach can be applied to any demand model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blattberg and George 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Manchanda et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, Bradlow and Rao 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Leichty et al. 2001</ref>). If we specify a utility function, the random component of marginal utility will induce a distribution on the quantity demanded via the first order conditions for utility maximization. This will create a likelihood for the data. If the indifference curves of the specified utility function intersect the axes of the positive orthant with nonzero slope, then there is the potential for corner solutions in which some of the components of the demand vector will be zero. These corners will create a mixed discretecontinuous distribution of demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kim et al. 2002)</ref>. Models involving multivariate latent variables (such as the MNP and multivariate probit models) have a likelihood function that can be computationally challenging to evaluate. For example, consider the MNP model. If alternative j is chosen from m alternatives, this reveals that we are in a certain region of the error space (actually a cone). Thus, the multinomial probabilities required for evaluation of the MNP likelihood involve integrals over a region of the error space</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Pr i = R z = X dz</formula><p>The choice probabilities involve integrals of a multivariate normal density over cones, and these integrals pose a potentially severe computational problem. Classical econometricians have focused on methods for approximating these integrals. The state of the art in this area is the so-called GHK algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Keane 1993)</ref>. The GHK algorithm uses importance sampling to approximate these probabilities. The current classical practice involves using simulation methods to approximate the likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Huber and Train 2001)</ref> and then uses standard maximum likelihood procedures, ignoring the simulation error (this is often called the simulated maximum likelihood approach).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data Augmentation</head><p>Direct evaluation of the censored normal likelihood can be avoided in a Bayesian approach if the parameters are augmented with a vector of latent variables, z (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tanner and Wong 1987)</ref>. To a Bayesian, all unobservable quantities can be considered the object of inference regardless of whether they are called parameters or latent variables. Technically, the number of latent variables can be the same as the number of observations, so large sample inference based on standard asymptotics does not apply. The posterior we now require is the joint distribution of the unobservable latent vector z , and the parameter vector ( , given the data y . To reduce notational burden, we will only consider the case of one observation. The joint posterior of z and is now the object of inference. The posterior of is a marginal of this joint posterior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p y = p z y dz</head><p>As it turns out, we can exploit the latent structure of the model to construct a "Gibbs-style" Markov chain that can sample from the joint posterior of the latents and the parameters. We can then simply marginalize on the data by discarding the draws of z. That is, we draw iteratively from the two conditional distributions: p z y and p z y</p><p>The draw of the latent z given y is a draw from a truncated normal distribution where the truncation depends on the model. In the MNP case, z is truncated to a m-dimensional cone. Given the latent vector z, inference proceeds as would standard Bayesian analysis of the underlying latent multivariate regression model. For the linear multivariate regression model, exact analytic results are available for the posterior of . Draws from the truncated multivariate normal can easily be accomplished via one-by-one draws from a series of univariate truncated normal distributions (see <ref type="bibr">Rossi 1994, Allenby et al. 1995)</ref>. This amounts to defining a subchain to draw the truncated normal vector. What is important to note is that by augmenting with the latent variable, we have avoided evaluation of any choice probabilities or other integrals of the multivariate normal. The cost of computational simplification is an enlargement of the state space for the Markov chain. In general, this will cause the data-augmented MCMC method to converge more slowly and exhibit higher autocorrelation than the non-data-augmented sampler. In the case of the MNP model, Nobile (1998) has indicated that, under certain conditions, the standard augmented Gibbs sampler can exhibit very high autocorrelation and proposes an improved chain.</p><p>Thus, data augmentation provides a clever way of avoiding evaluation of various multivariate integrals at the possible expense of introducing high autocorrelation in to the MCMC method. Our experience, however, has shown that the basic MNP Gibbs sampler works well and can handle problems for which the method of simulated maximum likelihood grinds to a halt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Identification</head><p>The latent variable formulation provides a natural mechanism for understanding the identification problem in these models. Identification problems stem from the fact that various transformations of the latent variables leave the observed censored outcome variable unchanged. For example, recall that in the MNP model the choice is made with the highest latent value. There are two transformations that leave the index of the maximum unchanged-location and scale shifts (see McCulloch and Rossi 1999, for further details). Identification can be achieved either by imposing exact restrictions on the model parameters, or by employing informative priors on the full parameter space and marginalizing on the identified parameters.</p><p>In many classical and Bayesian approaches, the approach to this scaling problem is to fix one of the elements of the covariance matrix (typically, the (1, 1) element) to one. For Bayesian methods, the restriction of the covariance matrix makes it difficult to use standard conjugate priors such as the Wishart prior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCulloch et al. (2000)</ref> show how to construct practical priors on the appropriate space of matrices. However, Bayesians are not limited to exact restrictions as a way of solving various identification problems. Use of a proper prior distribution ensures that the posterior is proper, even if the likelihood is not identified. In a Bayesian analysis, the issue of statistical identification shifts from an identified-not identified dichotomy, to an issue of the degree of identification and to subspaces of the posterior distribution that are well identified. For example, we can use a proper but diffuse prior in the unidentified parameter space, and simply marginalize or project down on the space of identified parameters. The only added cost of this procedure is making sure that the induced prior on the identified quantities is sufficiently diffuse to be usable in those situations in which we want our inferences driven primarily by the data. An even more striking example of the usefulness of this idea of navigating in the full, unidentified space can be found in the multivariate probit model. Here the identified parameters consist only of the correlation matrix of the latent variables because separate scaling constants can be used for each element. Until recently (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barnard et al. 2000)</ref> convenient priors for correlation matrices have not be available. Standard MCMC methods, such as Metropolis-Hastings, are difficult to adapt to the highly restricted space of valid correlation matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Manchanda et al. 1999)</ref>. In other words, it is hard to draw candidate correlation matrices. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Edwards and Allenby (2002)</ref> illustrate, all of this can be avoided by navigating in the unidentified space and projecting down to the space of correlation matrices (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">DeSarbo et al. 1999</ref>). These algorithms are fast and reliable.</p><p>We have seen that disaggregate marketing data is often lumpy, containing discrete mass points of probability. A natural framework for building models with discrete aspects is to use an underlying continuous latent variable, coupled with some sort of censoring mechanism. Not only are latent variables useful for generating models but also the new MCMC Bayesian inference methods nicely exploit the latent structure. Finally, identification problems that are common in latent variable models can be handled with great flexibility in the Bayesian approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Across-Unit Analysis:</head><p>Incorporating Heterogeneity via Hierarchical Models</p><p>The explosion in demand data available to marketers comes from the increased availability of disaggregate data.

This raises both modeling challenges, as well as major opportunities for improved profitability through decentralized marketing decisions that exploit heterogeneity. This new data comes in panel structure in which N , the number of units is large relative to T , the length of the panel. Thus, we may have a large amount of data obtained by observing a large number of decision units. For a variety of reasons, it is unlikely that we will ever have a very large amount of information about any one decision unit. In this situation, it is useful to have a model that pools information among the units. A flexible random effects model, combined with Bayesian inference methods, can produce accurate estimates at both the aggregate and individual decision unit level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Heterogeneity and Priors</head><p>A useful general structure for disaggregate data is a panel structure in which the units are regarded as independent, conditional on unit-level parameters. Given a joint prior on the collection of unit-level parameters, the posterior distribution can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p 1 N y 1 y N ∝ i p y i i × p 1 N</formula><p>The term in brackets is the conditional likelihood and the rightmost term is the joint prior with hyperparameter, . In many instances, the amount of information available for many of the units is small. This means that the specification of the functional form and hyperparameter for the prior may be important in determining the inferences made for any one unit.</p><p>A good example of this can be found in choice data sets in which consumers are observed to be choosing from a set of products. Many consumers ("units") do not choose all of the alternatives available during the course of observation. In this situation, most standard choice models do not have a bounded maximum likelihood estimate (the likelihood has an asymptote in a certain direction in the parameter space). In this situation, the prior is, in large part, determining the inferences made for these consumers. Assessment of the joint prior for 1 N is difficult, due to the high dimension of the parameter space and, therefore, some sort of simplification of the form of the prior is required. One frequently employed simplification is to assume that, conditional on the hyperparameter, 1 N are a priori independent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p 1 N y 1 y N ∝ i p y i i p i</formula><p>This means that inference for each unit can be conducted independently of all other units conditional on . This is the Bayesian analogue of fixed-effects approaches in classical statistics.</p><p>The specification of the conditionally independent prior can be very important, due to the scarcity of data for many of the units. Both the form of the prior and the values of the hyperparameters are important and can have pronounced effects on the unit-level inferences. For example, it is common to specify a normal prior, i ∼ N ¯ V . The normal form of this prior means that influence of the likelihood for each unit may be attenuated for likelihoods centered far away from the prior. That is, the thin tails of the normal distribution diminish the influence of outlying observations. In this sense, the specification of a normal form for the prior, whatever the values of the hyperparameters, is far from innocuous.</p><p>Assessment of the prior hyperparameters can also be challenging in any applied situation. For the case of the normal prior, some relatively diffuse prior may be a reasonable default choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rossi and Allenby (1993)</ref> use a prior, based on a scaled version of the pooled model information matrix. The prior covariance is scaled back to represent the expected information in one observation to insure a relatively diffuse prior. Use of this sort of normal prior will induce a phenomenon of "shrinkage" in which the Bayes estimates (posterior means) ˜ i = E i data i prior will be clustered more closely to the prior mean than the unit-level maximum likelihood estimates ˆ i . For diffuse prior settings, the normal form of the prior will be responsible for the shrinkage effects. In particular, outliers will be "shrunk" dramatically toward the prior mean. For many applications, this is a very desirable feature of the normal form prior. We will "shrink" the outliers in toward the rest of the parameter estimates and leave the rest pretty much alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Hierarchical Models</head><p>In general, however, it may be desirable to have the amount of shrinkage induced by the priors driven by information in the data. That is, we should "adapt" the level of shrinkage to the information in the data regarding the dispersion in i . If, for example, we observe that the i are tightly distributed about some location or that there is very little information in each unit-level likelihood, then we might want to increase the tightness of the prior so that the shrinkage effects are larger. This feature of "adaptive shrinkage" was the original motivation for work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Efron and Morris (1975)</ref> and others on empirical Bayes approaches in which prior parameters were estimated. These empirical Bayes approaches are an approximation to a full Bayes approach in which we specify a second-stage prior on the hyperparameters of the conditional independent prior. This specification is called a hierarchical Bayes model and consists of the unit-level likelihood and two stages of priors.</p><p>Likelihood: p y i i First-stage prior: p i Second-stage prior: p h . The joint posterior for the hierarchical model is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p 1 m y 1 y m h ∝ i p y i i p i × p h</formula><p>In the hierarchical model, the prior induced on the unit-level parameters is not an independent prior. The unit-level parameters are conditionally, but not unconditionally, a priori independent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p 1 m h = i p i p h d</formula><p>If, for example, the second-stage prior on is very diffuse, the marginal priors on the unit-level parameters, i , will be highly dependent, as each parameter has a large common component.</p><p>The hierarchical model specifies that both prior and sample information will be used to make inferences about the common parameter, . For example, in normal prior, i ∼ N ¯ V , the common parameters provide the location and the spread of the distribution of i . Thus, the posterior for the i will reflect a level of shrinkage inferred from the data. It is important to remember, however, that the normal functional form will induce a great deal of shrinkage for outlying units, even if the posterior of V is centered on large values.</p></div>

It is worth noting that in many applications the second-stage priors are set to be very diffuse (A −1 = 100I or larger) and the Wishart is set to have expectation I with very small degrees of freedom such as dim + 3. As we often have a larger number of units in the analysis, the data seems to overwhelm these priors and we learn a great deal about , or in the case of the normal prior, ¯ V .</p><p>In classical approaches to these models, the firststage prior is called a random effects model and is considered part of the likelihood. The random effects model is used to average the conditional likelihood to produce an unconditional likelihood which is a function of the common parameters alone.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">l = i p y i i p i d i</formula><p>In the classic econometric literature, much is made of the distinction between random coefficient models and fixed effect models. Fixed effect models are considered "nonparametric" in the sense that there is no specified distribution for the i parameters. Random coefficient models are often consider more efficient, but subject to specification error in the assumed random effects distribution, p i . In a Bayesian treatment, we see that the distinction between these two approaches is in the formulation of the joint prior on 1 m .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Heterogeneity Distributions</head><p>Much of the work in both marketing and in the general statistics literature has used the normal prior for the first stage of the hierarchical model. The normal prior offers a great deal of flexibility and fits conveniently with large Bayesian regression/multivariate analysis literature. The standard normal model can easily handle analysis of many units , and can be extended to include observable determinants of heterogeneity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allenby and Ginter 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Rossi et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, Talukdar et al. 2002</ref>. This can be done by introducing a multivariate regres-sion in the observables into the mean function</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">= Bz + u u ∼ N 0 V</formula><p>Here, z is a vector of explanatory variables that are meant to explain across-unit differences. Typically, we might postulate that various demographic or market characteristics might explain differences in intercepts (brand preference) or slopes (marketing mix sensitivities). In linear models, these normal prior specifications amount to specifying a set of interactions between the explanatory variables in the model explaining y (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCulloch and Rossi 1994</ref>, for further discussion of this point).</p><p>While the normal model is flexible, there are several drawbacks for marketing applications. As discussed above, the thin tails of the normal model tend to shrink outlying units greatly toward the center of the data. While this may be desirable in many applications, it is a drawback in discovering new structure in the data. For example, if the distribution of the unit-level parameters is bimodal (something to be expected in models with brand intercepts), then a normal first-stage prior may shrink the unit-level estimates to such a degree as to mask the multimodality (see below for further discussions of diagnostics). Fortunately, the normal model provides a building block for a mixture of normals extension of the first-stage prior. The mixture of normals model can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p ¯ 1 ¯ K V 1 V K = r 1 ¯ 1 V 1 + • • • + r K ¯ K V K r k = 1</formula><p>It is well-known that the mixture of normals model provides a great deal of flexibility and that with enough components, virtually any multivariate density can be approximated. In particular, multiple modes are possible. Fatter tails than the normal can also be accommodated by mixing in normal components with large variance.</p><p>The mixture of normals model can be viewed as a generalization of the popular finite mixture model. The finite mixture model views the prior as a discrete distribution with a set of mass points. This approach has been very popular in marketing, due to the interpretation of each mixture point as representing a "segment" and to the ease of estimation. In addition, the finite mixture approach can be given the interpretation of a nonparametric method as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heckman and Singer (1982)</ref>. Critics of the finite mixture approach have pointed to the implausibility of the existence of a small number of homogeneous segments, as well as the fact that the finite mixture approach does not allow for extreme units whose parameters lie outside the convex hull of the support points. The mixture of normals approach avoids the drawbacks of the finite mixture model, while incorporating many of the more desirable features.</p><p>The MCMC algorithm for the normal heterogeneity model can easily be extended to handle the mixture of normals model by appending indicator variables for the mixture component to the state space. Conditional on the indicator variables, the draws of the normal component parameters are standard conjugate draws given the classification of the observations into one of the K components. The indicator variables, conditional on all other parameters, have a multinomial distribution with probabilities proportional to the number of units assigned to the component and the likelihood that the unit's parameters are from the component distribution.</p><p>In mixture of components models, there is a generic identification problem, generally known as the labelswitching problem. A model with a given sequence of component parameters is observationally equivalent to any permutations of this sequence of parameters. Component labels, therefore, require identifying restrictions for inference to occur. One solution to this problem is to put informative priors on the model parameters (e.g.,¯ 1 &gt;¯ 2 &gt; • • • &gt;¯ K , which works well when the data are in agreement with the restriction. However, if the data are not in agreement (e.g., the components primarily differ in V , not¯ , then the prior can lead to a chain that is slow to converge <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frühwirth-Schnatter et al. 2003)</ref>. It should be noted, however, that the presence of label-switching does not affect inference about parameters of a particular unit, i . If the normal component mixing distribution is seen as a flexible device for approximating some unknown heterogeneity distribution, then inference about the distribution of heterogeneity can be made directly with the set of unit parameters, i , without attempting to identify or estimate the component parameters.</p><p>In many situations, we have prior information on the signs of various coefficients in the base model. For example, price parameters are negative and advertising effects are positive. In a Bayesian approach, this sort of prior information can be included by modifying the first-stage prior. We replace the normal distribution with a distribution with restricted support, corresponding to the appropriate sign restrictions. For example, we can use a log-normal distribution for a parameter which is restricted via sign by the reparameterization, = ln . However, note that this change in the form of the prior can destroy some of the conjugate relationships which are exploited in the Gibbs-sampler. However, if metropolis-style methods are used to generate draws in the Markov chain, it is a simple matter to directly reparameterize the likelihood function, by substituting exp( ) for , rather than rely on the heterogeneity distribution to impose the range restriction. What is more important is to ask whether the log-normal prior is appropriate. The left tail of the log-normal distribution declines to zero, insuring a mode for the log-normal distribution at a strictly positive value. For situations in which we want to admit zero as a possible value for the parameter, this prior may not be appropriate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boatwright et al. (1999)</ref> explore the use of truncated normal priors as an alternative to the log-normal reparameterization approach. Truncated normal priors are much more flexible, allowing for mass to be piled up at zero.</p><p>Bayesian models can also accommodate structural heterogeneity, or changes in the likelihood specification for a unit of analysis. The likelihood is specified as a mixture of likelihoods:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">p y it ik = r 1 p 1 y it i1 + • • • + r K p K y it iK</formula><p>and estimation proceeds by appending indicator variables for the mixture component to the state space. Conditional on the indicator variables, the datum, y it , is assigned to one of K likelihoods. The indicator variables, conditional on all other parameters, have a multinomial distribution with probabilities proportional to the number of observations assigned to the component, and the probability that the datum arise from likelihood. Models of structural heterogeneity have been used to investigate intraindividual change in the decision process due to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yang and Allenby 2000)</ref> and fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Otter et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, Bayesian methods have recently been used to relax the commonly made assumption that the unit parameters, i , are i.i.d. draws from the distribution of heterogeneity.

Since the MCMC estimation algorithm employs full conditional distributions of the model parameters, the draw of i involves using a local average for the mean of the mixing distribution.

Typically, very diffuse priors are used for the second stage. Thus, it is the first-stage prior which is important, and will always remain important, as long as there are only a few observations available per household. Since the parameters of the first-stage prior are inferred from the data, the main focus of concern should be on the form of this distribution.</p><p>In the econometric literature, the use of parametric distributions of heterogeneity (e.g., normal distributions) are often criticized on the grounds that their misspecification leads to inconsistent estimates of the common model parameters (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heckman and Singer 1982)</ref>. For example, if the true distribution of household parameters were skewed or bimodal, our inferences based on a symmetric, unimodal normal prior could be misleading. One simple approach would be to plot the distribution of the posterior household means and compare this to the implied normal distribution evaluated at the Bayes estimates of the hyperparameters, N E ¯ data E V . The posterior means are not constrained to follow the normal distribution because the normal distribution is only part of the prior and the posterior is influenced by the unitlevel data. This simple approach is in the right spirit but could be misleading due to the fact that we do not properly account for uncertainty in the unit-level parameter estimates. <ref type="bibr">Allenby and Rossi (1999)</ref> provide a diagnostic check of the assumption of normality in the first stage of the prior distribution that properly accounts for parameter uncertainty. To handle uncertainty in our knowledge of the common parameters of the normal distribution, we compute the predictive distribution of i for unit i , selected at random from the population of households with the random effects distribution. Using our data and model, we can define the predictive distribution of i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">i data = ¯ V p ¯ V data d¯ dV Here i ¯ V is the normal prior distribution.</formula><p>We can use our MCMC draws of¯ V , coupled with draws from the normal prior, to construct an estimate of this distribution. The diagnostic check is constructed by comparing the distribution of the unitlevel posterior means to the predictive distribution based on the model given above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Findings and Influence on Marketing Practice</head><p>The last ten years of work on heterogeneity in marketing has yielded several important findings.</p><p>Researchers have explored a rather large set of firststage models with a normal distribution of heterogeneity across units. In particular, investigators have considered a first-stage normal linear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blattberg and George 1991)</ref>, a first-stage logit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lenk 1994, 1995)</ref>, a first-stage probit <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McCulloch and Rossi 1994)</ref>, a first-stage Poisson <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Neelamegham and Chintagunta 1999)</ref>, and a firststage generalized gamma distribution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Allenby et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Jen et al. 2003</ref>. The major conclusion is that there is a substantial degree of heterogeneity across units in various marketing data sets. This finding of a large degree of heterogeneity holds out substantial promise for the study of preferences, both in terms of substantive and practical significance <ref type="bibr">(Ansari et al. 2000)</ref>. There may be substantial heterogeneity bias in models that do not properly account for heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chang et al. 1999)</ref>, and there is large value in customizing marketing decisions to the unit level (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rossi et al. 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Yang et al. (2002a)</ref> investigate the source of brand preference, and find evidence that variation in the consumption environment, and resulting motivations, leads to changes in a unit's preference for a product offering (see also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arora and Allenby 1999)</ref>. Motivating conditions are an interesting domain for research, as they preexist the marketplace, offering a measure of demand that is independent of marketplace offerings. Other research has documented evidence that the decision process employed by a unit is not necessarily constant throughout a unit's purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yang and Allenby 2000)</ref> and response <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Otter et al. 2003</ref>) history. This evidence indicates that the appropriate unit of analysis for marketing is at the level that is less aggregate than a person or respondent, although there is evidence that household sensitivity to marketing variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ainslie and Rossi 1998)</ref> and state dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Seetharaman et al. 1999</ref>) is constant across categories.</p><p>The normal continuous model of heterogeneity appears to do reasonably well in characterizing this heterogeneity, but there has not yet been sufficient experimentation with alternative models, such as the mixture of normals, to draw any definitive conclusions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allenby et al. 1998)</ref>. With the relatively short panels typically found in marketing applications, it may be difficult to identify much more detailed structure beyond that afforded by the normal model. In addition, relatively short panels may produce a confounding of the finding of heterogeneity with various model misspecifications in the first stage. If only one observation is available for each unit, then the probability model for the unit level is the mixture of the first-stage model with the second-stage prior:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">p y = p y p d</formula><p>This mixing can provide a more flexible probability model. In the one observation situation, we can never determine whether it is "heterogeneity," or lack of flexibility that causes the Bayesian hierarchical model to fit the data well. Obviously, with more than one observation per unit, this changes, and it is possible to separately diagnose first-stage model problems and deficiencies in the assumed heterogeneity distribution. However, with short panels there is unlikely to be a clean separation between these problems, and it may be the case that some of the heterogeneity detected in marketing data is really due to lack of flexibility in the base model. There have been some comparisons of the normal continuous model with the discrete approximation approach of a finite-mixture model. It is our view that it is conceptually inappropriate to view any population of units as being comprised of only a small number of homogeneous groups and, therefore, the appropriate interpretation of the finite mixture approach is an approximation method. <ref type="bibr">Allenby and Rossi (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lenk et al. (1996)</ref> show some of the shortcomings of the finite-mixture model, and provide some evidence that the finite-mixture model does not recover reasonable unit-level parameter estimates. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andrews et al. (2002)</ref> use simulated data to suggest that unit-level recovery is comparable between the normal-and finite-mixture approaches.</p><p>At the same time that the Bayesian work in the academic literature has shown the ability to produce unit-level estimates, there has been increased interest on the part of practitioners in unit-level analysis. Conjoint researchers have always had an interest in ROSSI AND ALLENBY Bayesian Statistics and Marketing respondent-level part-worths and had various ad hoc schemes for producing these estimates. Recently, the Bayesian hierarchical approach to the logit model has been implemented in the popular Sawtooth conjoint software. Experience with this software and simulation studies have lead Rich Johnson, Sawtooth software's founder, to conclude that Bayesian methods are superior to others considered in the conjoint literature (Sawtooth Software 2001).</p><p>Retailers are amassing volumes of store-level scanner data. Not normally available to academic researchers, this store-level data is potentially useful for informing the basic retail decisions such as pricing and merchandizing. Attempts to develop reliable models for pricing and promotion have been frustrated by the inability to produce reliable promotion and price response parameters. Thus, the promise of store-level pricing has gone unrealized. Recently, a number of firms, including the leader DemandTec, have appeared in this space, offering data-based pricing and promotion services to retail customers. At the heart of DemandTec's approach is a Bayesian shrinkage model applied to store-sku-week data, obtained directly from the retail client. The Bayesian shrinkage methods allow DemandTec to produce reasonable and relatively stable store-level parameter estimates. DemandTec builds on the approach of Montgomery (1997).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Decision Theory</head><p>The vast majority of the recent Bayesian literature in marketing emphasizes the value of the Bayesian approach to inference, particularly in situations with limited information. Bayesian inference is only a special case of the more general Bayesian decision theoretic approach. Bayesian decision theory has two critical and separate components: (1) a loss function, and (2) the posterior distribution. The loss function associates a loss with a state of nature and a action, l a , where a is the action and is the state of nature (parameter). The optimal decision maker chooses the action so as to minimize expected loss, where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior distribution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">min al a = l a p data d</formula><p>Parameter inference is a simple case of the general decision theory set-up, in which the loss is often taken to be quadratic. In this case, the optimal "action" is an estimator taken to be the posterior mean of the parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Model Selection</head><p>In many scientific settings, the action is a choice between competing models. In the Bayesian approach, it is possible to define a set of models M 1 M k , and calculate a measure of the posterior probability of a model. If the loss function is zero when the correct model is chosen and equal for all cases in which the incorrect model is chosen, then the optimal Bayesian decision maker chooses the model with the highest posterior probability. In a parametric setting, the posterior probability of a model can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">p M k D = p D M k p M k p D M k = p D M k p k d</formula><p>where D denotes the "data." In the Bayesian approach, the posterior probability only requires specification of the class of models and the priors. There is no distinction between nested and nonnested models as in the hypothesis-testing literature in the classical literature. However, we do require specification of the class of models under consideration; there is no omnibus measure of the plausibility of a given model or group of models versus some unspecified, and possibly unknown, set of alternative models.</p><p>In situations where two models are being compared, it is common to compute the ratio of posterior model probabilities. This ratio can be expressed as the ratio of average likelihoods times the prior odds ratio. The ratio of average likelihood is sometimes called the Bayes factor for a model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">p M 1 D p M 2 D = l 1 1 p 1 1 d 1 l 2 2 p 2 2 d 2 × p M 1 p M 2</formula><p>The Bayes factor can be quite sensitive to the prior specification and, in particular, to the prior diffusion.</p><p>As the prior becomes more and more spread out, relative to the fixed likelihood, the average value of the likelihood declines. Thus, if the prior for Model 1 is a great deal more spread out than the prior for Model 2, this may result in Bayes factors which favor Model 2 (this is certainly true in a limiting sense). In particular, diffuse and improper priors can result in undefined Bayes factors. We recommend that close attention be placed on the prior assessment and that prior sensitivity analysis be performed whenever computing posterior model probabilities.</p><p>A wide variety of methods have been proposed to approximate the posterior model probability. The most widely used method is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schwarz (1978)</ref>, who computed an asymptotic approximation that depends only on the dimension of the model. This is the idea behind the well-known Schwarz or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model choice. Except for very special forms of priors, the Schwarz method is extremely inaccurate and should not be relied on for computation of the posterior model probability. Various numerical methods that rely on either the Laplace approximation or importance sampling methods of numerical integration are the preferred method of approximation. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Newton and Raftery (1994)</ref> offer a convenient method for approximating a Bayes factor using MCMC simulation draws to estimate the average likelihood as the harmonic mean of the likelihoods of a sample from the posterior distribution. This estimator is consistent but may be unstable due to draws of the parameters that are associated with small likelihood values.</p></div>

A high level of similarity among units leads to a high level of information shared. Because the level of similarity is determined by the data via the first-stage prior, the shrinkage aspects of the Bayesian approach adapt to the data. For example, <ref type="bibr">Neelameghan and Chintagunta (1999)</ref> show that similarities between countries can be used to predict the sales patterns following the introduction of new products.</p><p>The value of a given information set can be assessed using a profit metric and the posteriors of , corresponding to the two information sets. For example, consider two information sets A and B, along with corresponding posteriors, p A p B . We solve the decision problem using these two posterior distributions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rossi et al. (1996)</ref> use this approach to value various information sets available on individual households.</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">l = max x d * l x d x cov = max x d ¯ x d x cov p l d l = A B</formula><p>A targeting couponing problem that anticipated the now popular Catalina Marketing Inc. products was used to value a sequence of expanding individual level information sets.

We compare profits that can be obtained via our disaggregate inferences about i with profits that could be obtained using only aggregate information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Open Issues and Directions for Future Research</head><p>Researchers have long noted the conceptual appeal of the Bayesian framework for inference and decision making. However, the potential of the Bayesian approach was not realized due to computational constraints. Without modern simulation-based methods, researchers were restricted to a short list of likelihoods and associated conjugate priors. The developments of the last 15 years have freed us from computation constraints, allowing for the analysis of virtually any model. We now can consider models once thought to be impossible to compute, and we can use priors of virtually any form. The only constraint now, is the ability of the data to identify model parameters, rather than the ability of the analyst to conduct inference for this model. However, the recent developments have an even more profound impact than simply freeing us from computational constraints. The nature of the MCMC methods emphasize a modularity in the construction of models, typically achieved through a combination of conditional distributions. These conditional distributions specify the nature of the relationships between observed variables and allow for the construction of more complicated relationships. Thus, the researcher can create a more complex model simply by adding layers to the hierarchy. Consider, as a simple example, the relationship between sales and price. Much attention has been devoted to fitting the conditional distribution of sales y given price x . However, the actual decision process is certainly not well represented by one conditional distribution. Many endorse the concept of a latent consideration set <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chiang et al. 1999)</ref> in which a product must first be included in the consideration set before a consumer evaluates the impact of price. If w represents the consideration set, then the model has been enlarged to the two layers y w x, and w z, where the consideration set is influenced by another variable z (e.g., advertising). In the end, the hierarchical model specifies a special form for the conditional distribution of y x z that allows exploration of the intermediary conditional relationships. Moreover, the specification of hierarchical conditional models is consistent with process models of consumer behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McFadden 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Consideration sets are only one example of a latent process that intervenes between the measurements of the marketing mix variables and the sales outcome variable. Other important examples include price search and consumption. In typical demand data, we do not observe the consumption of goods but merely their purchases. In much demand modeling in marketing, this distinction is glossed over, and the demand model is based on a utility function defined directly on the purchase quantities. Models that explicitly recognize that purchases are made in anticipation of future consumption have recently received attention. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dube (2003)</ref> explains simultaneous purchases of different varieties via anticipation of changes in tastes over future consumption occasions. <ref type="bibr">Yang et al. (2002)</ref> consider a model in which the utility derived from goods is dependent on the context of consumption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Erdem and Keane (2003)</ref> consider dynamic models of consumer demand in which households stockpile goods for future consumption. All of these models are amenable to Bayesian analysis via data augmentation in which latent variables, such as consumption, are introduced into the inference procedures.</p><p>Price search models are another example of a latent process of great importance in marketing. Consumers are not always fully informed about the prices of choice alternatives and must engage in price search. We do not observe this price search process directly but only the outcomes. In a classical approach, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mehta and Srinivasan (2003)</ref>, the likelihood for the search model must be evaluated by integrating over all possible search paths. In a data augmentation approach, this integration can be achieved by introduction of latent variables that represent search possibilities. In an MCMC method for navigating the posterior distribution of search parameters and latent variables, we do not enumerate all possible search paths but, instead, navigate among paths of high posterior probability. We believe that MCMC approaches, together with data augmentation, hold great promise for analyzing models with very large latent state spaces such as price search models and discrete dynamic programming models, in general.</p><p>Many models of consumer behavior include threshold-like effects. For example, some models of consideration set formation have screening rules in which a threshold level of an attribute is defined. The threshold levels are unobservable parameters, and the likelihood over these parameters has discontinuities. This rules out the use of standard derivative-based maximization methods. MCMC methods simply require draws from various conditional posterior distributions in order to navigate the parameter space. Drawing from a distribution with a density that is not continuous poses no special difficulties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gilbride and Allenby (2003)</ref> illustrate how this can be implemented for choice models with conjunction and disjunctive screening rules. These developments open many possibilities for analysis of models with threshold components.</p><p>Thus, hierarchical modeling methods achieve not only a great flexibility as emphasized in the Bayesian statistics literature, but also they are well-suited to the elaboration of various latent process views of consumer behavior and decision making. We expect research in marketing to focus on a better understanding of the process by which the consumer makes buying decisions, in hopes of creating more realistic, yet still parsimonious, models of behavior.</p><p>A major challenge facing marketing practitioners is the merging of information acquired across a variety of different datasets. For example, a firm may have access to consumer purchase information, survey information on a subsample of consumers, and syndicated aggregate sales information. Marketplace and survey data cannot be combined without some view to the processes by which consumers make buying decisions and respond to survey instruments. Bayesian methods will facilitate the integration of these data sources through the specification of a common set of behavioral parameters and the processes by which these are translated into either survey responses or purchase decisions.</p><p>The observational data used in much of quantitative marketing is derived from an environment in which the outcome and input variables are jointly determined. Marketing mix variables are set by managers with a view toward optimizing some objective function that includes the dependent variable. For example, prices may be set with some knowledge of either price sensitivity or price demand shocks. Direct marketing response data is obtained from samples of consumers who were selected in a nonrandom fashion, with a view toward maximizing response rates or profitability. Sales forces are allocated using some sort of heuristic that attempts to create an optimal allocation in which the marginal benefit of further effort is equated to marginal cost. This means that we cannot model just the conditional distribution of the outcome variable, given the marketing mix variables, but that we must consider the joint distribution of all variables.</p><p>The joint determination of both outcome and input variables poses considerable challenges for statistical inference and modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Manchanda et al. (2003)</ref> consider sales force problems in which the level of sales force effort at a given account is a function of sales response parameters. Price endogeneity is another example of a challenging problem that involves deriving the joint distribution of price, sales, and possible exogeneous variables. Computational difficulties have limited the use of likelihood-based methods and, instead, instrumental variables procedures have been commonly employed. We believe there is substantial room for improvement in this area by the use of likelihood-based Bayesian approaches. As an example, consider a model of demand and supply in which there are cost shocks and a common demand shock that is used by retailers in setting prices. This model has a likelihood that is the joint distribution of price and quantity sold. This joint distribution is derived from the distribution of costs shocks and demand shocks. While the mapping from shocks to observables is an implicit nonlinear system of equations, there is no conceptual difficulty with implementing a metropolis algorithm for this system. The modularity of the metropolis style MCMC method means that elaborating the model by adding, for example, consumer heterogeneity, is straightforward (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Yang et al. 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>We have emphasized the value of Bayesian methods in situations with limited information. While the total amount of data available has exploded, the amount of information about any one consumer is likely to remain limited. The customization of marketing actions to finer and finer levels of aggregation requires the ability to make inferences in conditions of limited information and to characterize the level of uncertainty in these inferences. Thus, we expect Bayesian methods will play a critical role in realizing the potential of micromarketing and any analysis conducted at a microlevel.</p><p>Finally, there are a number of important problems in marketing that are essentially pure prediction problems. Given a set of information on a consumer, the prediction problem is to predict the response to a given configuration of the marketing environment. Information available about the consumer can be summarized with a huge set of potential variables. The marketing environment itself can also be summarized in many possible ways. One important applied problem is to sift through a large number of possible variables and functional forms to find the best possible prediction rule. In the Bayesian statistics literature, there has been substantial progress in the "variable selection" problem, and we believe these methods have great promise for application to marketing problems.</p><p>Structural or process-oriented approaches to modeling achieve the prediction goal via a specification of the decision process. This guides in the selection of variables and in the structure of relationships between variables. However, structural theories are typically silent on the exact parametric form of functional relationships or distributions. Again, there is an opportunity for application of Bayesian nonparametric methods to the structural approach as well <ref type="bibr">Shively 1998, Shively et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, Bayesian statistical methods offer an appealing set of tools to researchers in marketing. The Bayesian approach offers an integrated view of inference and decision making that is applicable to both theoretical and applied analysis. Moreover, the hierarchical modeling structure that is exploited in MCMC estimation methods is congruent with theories of behavior and offers a means of integrating information across multiple data sources. Finally, the computational advantages of Bayesian methods allow for study of high-dimensional data and complex relationships that are common in marketing. We encourage our colleagues and students to experiment with and apply Bayesian methods.</p><p>The effects associated with massively categorical variables, such as zip codes, are modeled in a random-effects specification.
