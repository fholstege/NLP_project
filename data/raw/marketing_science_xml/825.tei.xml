<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Marketing researchers and practitioners have long acknowledged that price response functions need not be monotonic and symmetric (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gutenberg 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Simon 1969</ref>. Kinked demand curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Putler 1992)</ref> imply that brand price elasticity might be subject to price benchmarks or thresholds. For example, shallow discounts might fail to generate consumer response and thus have underproportional effects on market performance compared to deep discounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gutenberg 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Hruschka 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Gilbride and Allenby 2004</ref>. At the same time, consumers might react strongly to even relatively minor price increases while habituation/adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahneman 1991)</ref> leads to saturation effects for major price increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(van Heerde et al. 2001)</ref>. Managerial interest in this topic is twofold:</p><p>(1) to predict the sales and profit impact of different levels of price increases and decreases, and (2) to identify the category and brand characteristics that affect price elasticity thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Han et al. 2001)</ref>. As managers typically assess threshold effects by simple methods based on a cross-tabulation of sales versus price points across stores, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bucklin and Gupta (1999)</ref> call for more academic research on price threshold analysis. In this context, while complex threshold effects have been widely discussed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moran 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Simon 1989</ref>), they have often escaped explicit modeling and empirical observation.</p><p>From a research perspective, there have been two sophisticated approaches to the problem of estimating price thresholds. First, individual-level analyses showed asymmetric thresholds around a reference price, with a "latitude of acceptance" region or region of indifference such that changes in price within this region produce no changes in perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Monroe 1990</ref>). However, their focus remained restricted to the specific behavioral phenomenon of interest: historical or competitive reference prices and assimilation/contrast effects or saturation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gupta and Cooper 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Thaler 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Han et al. 2001</ref>. Second, completely data-driven approximation of the effect curve offered more flexible estimation approaches to <ref type="bibr">Pauwels, Srinivasan, and Franses: When Do Price Thresholds Matter in Retail Categories?</ref> 84 Marketing Science 26(1), pp. 83-100, © 2007 INFORMS capture a wide variety of price threshold phenomena <ref type="bibr">(van Heerde et al. 2001, Kalyanam and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shively 1998)</ref>. Unfortunately, this flexibility comes at the expense of severe data requirements and difficult interpretation of the parameters, especially across categories to generate guidelines for retail pricing.</p><p>Thus, while research points to the existence of brand price thresholds and kinked demand curves, the extant marketing literature lacks a large-scale econometric investigation of this phenomenon across product categories in retail markets. In particular, retail pricing managers need insights into the moderating factors of threshold-based price elasticity at the aggregate level, where they have to set prices and are accountable for the sales results. A systematic comparison across brands and categories is therefore needed to uncover empirical generalizations, to offer concrete managerial guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Shugan 2003)</ref>, and to identify important areas for future research. As a result, we seek to address the following research questions: (i) Is there time-series evidence of thresholds in price elasticity across a wide variety of fast-moving consumer good categories? <ref type="bibr">(ii)</ref> To what extent are such deviations from constant price elasticity driven by historical versus competitive benchmark prices (hereafter HBP versus CBP)? (iii) Is there time-series evidence for asymmetric thresholds and slope changes (latitude of acceptance versus saturation effects) for gains and losses? (iv) Do these characteristics of price elasticity vary across categories and brands? We apply the methodology of logistic smooth-transition regression (STR) models (see <ref type="bibr">Van Dijk et al. 2002, among others)</ref> to assess the impact of price thresholds on price elasticities.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, we propose a research framework and hypotheses for both price discounts and price hikes on three dimensions: the nature of the benchmark (historical versus competitive), the size of the price threshold (small versus large), and the price slope difference (latitude of acceptance versus saturation effects). Next, we focus on the category and brand characteristics that might influence the presence, nature, and size of price thresholds and price elasticity differences. In §3, we discuss the econometric representation of the model we use to examine threshold-based transitions in short-run price elasticity. Section 4 describes the data and operationalization of the variables, while §5 reports the results. Finally, we formulate conclusions and future research avenues in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Thresholds in Short-Run Price Elasticity</head><p>Over the past decade, researchers have identified thresholds in price elasticity (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Little 1994, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Raman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Bass 2002)</ref> and have called for further exploration of this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bucklin and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gupta 1999, Simon 1989)</ref>. Remaining issues include (1) the nature of these price thresholds or benchmarks, (2) the size of the thresholds, and (3) the sign of the change to the price elasticity. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent brand and category moderators influence these characteristics of price thresholds in retail markets. We discuss these in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Characteristics of Price Thresholds</head><p>First, researchers have typically assumed that consumers use either a historical (temporal) benchmark price 1 or a competitive (contextual) benchmark price in brand choice decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Briesch et al. 1997)</ref>. The former view argues that consumers remember the prices encountered on past purchase occasions while the latter view argues that a benchmark price is formed during the purchase occasion on the basis of the prices observed (e.g., shelf prices of competing products). This distinction in benchmark price formation is important for market-level price setting. Historical benchmark prices imply that managers should beware of own past discounting as brand price should compare favorably with past own prices, whereas competitive benchmark prices focus management attention on current competitive prices as brand price should compare favorably with those at the point of purchase <ref type="bibr">Papatla 2000, Rajendran and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tellis 1994)</ref>. Interestingly, the few papers that analyzed both historical and competitive benchmark prices find that both benchmark types matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kumar et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Mayhew and Winer 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Rajendran and Tellis 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Mazumdar and Papatla 2000</ref>. Because these studies analyzed one or a few product categories, we do not yet know under which circumstances either type is more important. Second, the observed threshold size is important for the interpretation and managerial implications of threshold-based price elasticity. Smaller thresholds, typically less than 15%, have been interpreted as an assimilation effect in consumer price perception and encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kalyanaram and Winer 1995)</ref>. Instead, larger thresholds could reflect intentional consumer behavior of lie in wait for even better deals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mela et al. 1997)</ref>. Moreover, threshold size could be asymmetric to gains (price decreases) versus losses (price increases) <ref type="bibr">Little 1994, Moran 1978)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Han et al. (2001)</ref> found larger thresholds for gains versus losses in the coffee category. It is currently unclear whether this finding generalizes to other categories. A second asymmetry has been found for the magnitude of the elasticity difference, as consumers react more to perceived price losses than to price gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kalyanaram and Winer 1995)</ref> or vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Greenleaf 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Krishnamurthi et al. 1992</ref>).</p><p>Finally, most researchers have focused on demonstrating a latitude of price acceptance, implying amplification of the price elasticity beyond a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sherif et al. 1965)</ref>. In contrast, recent research has shown the possibility of saturation effects, implying attenuation of the price elasticity beyond a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(van Heerde et al. 2001</ref>). The distinction is crucial for pricing managers, as it implies either larger or smaller bang for the buck once the price change exceeds the threshold. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> juxtaposes "latitude of acceptance" and "saturation" effects for negative price gaps (gains to the consumer; price discounts to the manager) and positive price gaps (losses to the consumer, price hikes to the manager).</p><p>Several consumer behavior theories are consistent with the four scenarios in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>• For negative price gaps (consumer gains), a latitude of acceptance is implied by adaptation level theory and assimilation-contrast theory <ref type="bibr">Little 1994, Kalwani et al. 1990</ref>): Before consumers can contrast the low price with their benchmark, the price must be perceived as different. Moreover, even when they perceive and recognize discounts, consumers may not react strongly if they are waiting for still better deals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mela et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Kopalle et al. 1999</ref>. Interestingly, both assimilation-contrast and "lie-inwait" effects have been demonstrated only vis-à-vis an historical benchmark (i.e., the past price of the focal brand), not vis-à-vis competitive benchmarks.</p><p>• In contrast, saturation effects for gains are consistent with consumers engaging in "discounting of discounts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gupta and Cooper 1992)</ref>. Intuitively, consumers do not fully consider that the price is that much lower than the benchmark and adjust their gain perception to more reasonable levels. Alternatively, saturation effects in retail markets may originate from consumer limits to purchasing, transporting, and stockpiling products <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(van Heerde et al. 2001</ref>). These physical limits may apply to discounts compared to both historical or competitive benchmarks.</p><p>• For positive price gaps (consumer losses), a latitude of acceptance is again consistent with adaptation level theory: A loss must also exceed a consumer's price threshold in order to be perceived. Instead, minor price hikes within the threshold are less likely to be noticed <ref type="bibr">Little 1994, Kalwani and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yim 1992)</ref>.</p><p>• Saturation effects for consumer losses may represent a "discounting of price hikes," i.e., consumers may mentally adjust price increases to more "reasonable" levels. Such behavior might occur as a rationalization for buying products at higher prices, for instance, for indulgence products, or simply reflect a partial encoding of the price increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alba et al. 1991)</ref>. Beyond perception, saturation effects are also consistent with the presence of a core loyal consumer base with a strong need or desire for the focal brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jacoby and Chestnut 1978)</ref>. While these consumers might buy less quantity as brand price increases, they do not refrain altogether from buying the focal brand, even at very high prices.</p><p>In sum, empirical generalizations on price thresholds should consider both "latitude of acceptance" and "saturation" effects and allow for asymmetric thresholds for gains and losses.

Definitions: The "base elasticity" 0 is the price elasticity around the benchmark price (within the price threshold).

Negative (positive) values signify more (less) negative price elasticity, and thus higher (lower) price sensitivity beyond the gain threshold. The "elasticity difference loss" L is the elasticity change (from 0 beyond the loss threshold. Positive (negative) values signify less (more) negative price elasticity, and thus lower (higher) price sensitivity beyond the loss threshold. The "gain threshold " G is the percentage change in price beyond which the price elasticity changes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Moderating Role of Category and Brand</head><p>Characteristics Because managers have a keen interest in which of the identified scenarios apply under which circumstances, we develop hypotheses on the drivers of (1) the relative importance of historical versus competitive price benchmarks, (2) the price slope (elasticity difference) beyond the price threshold (latitude of acceptance versus saturation effects), and (3) the location of these benchmarks (threshold size). Prior marketing theory drives our selection of the secondstage covariates, which include category/product and brand characteristics. The former are of key interest to retailers (and multicategory manufacturers) setting pricing guidelines across categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Shankar and Bolton 2004)</ref>, while the latter are important to both retailers and brand managers.</p><p>2.2.1. Historical or Competitive Benchmarks? Latitude of Acceptance or Saturation Effects? We gauge the likelihood for historical versus competitive benchmarks by adapting the accessibility-diagnosticity framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Feldman and Lynch 1988)</ref>. In particular, the prominence of historical price benchmarks increases with (1) how likely the consumer is to remember past prices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Biehal and Chakravarti 1983)</ref>, and (2) how diagnostic this memory of past prices is in predicting current/future prices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Briesch et al. 1997)</ref>. We expect these drivers to also affect the price elasticity beyond the gain threshold, i.e., whether large price discounts yield higher price sensitivity 2 (latitude of acceptance) or lower price sensitivity (saturation effects).</p><p>Hypothesis 1A. Historical benchmarks are more prominent in expensive categories.</p><p>Expensive categories should draw greater attention to prices relative to less expensive categories purchased at the same outlet. As such, consumers are more likely to recall the price because it stands out in comparison to the prices they pay for items in less expensive categories. Therefore, historical prices in such categories should be easier to recall than in those that are less expensive. In sum, we expect that such categories are dominated by consumers who use historical benchmark prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mazumdar and Papatla 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Hypothesis 1B. Price elasticity beyond the gain threshold is more negative in expensive categories.</p><p>By the same token, large price discounts on expensive products should engage more consumers than small price discounts do. Indeed, price decreases on expensive products bring them within reach for budget-conscious consumers, enabling them to enjoy quality/prestige benefits that they otherwise would not <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chandon et al. 2000)</ref>. As consumers differ in terms of their reservation prices, larger discounts enable more shoppers to buy the expensive products and should thus yield more negative price elasticity than smaller discounts. Such effect is less likely for cheaper products, which most consumers are able to afford at regular prices.</p><p>Hypothesis 2A. Historical benchmarks are more prominent in categories with low price volatility.</p><p>The ability to remember previous prices and therefore use historical benchmarks can be influenced by the effort required to keep track of prices. The required effort would be low in categories in which prices are less volatile, and high in categories in which retail prices fluctuate due to frequent promotional activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mazumdar and Papatla 2000)</ref>. In categories with lower price volatility, memory-based benchmark prices are more accessible and more diagnostic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Briesch et al. 1997</ref>).</p><p>Hypothesis 2B. Price elasticity beyond the gain threshold is more negative in categories with high price volatility.</p><p>High category price volatility typically implies a high promotional intensity, which makes shoppers accustomed to (minor) price discounts and teaches them to lie in wait for substantial price promotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mela et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Kopalle et al. 1999</ref>. Therefore, we should observe a more negative price elasticity once the promotion crosses the gain threshold. Hypothesis 3A. Historical benchmarks are more prominent for planned purchases.</p><p>Categories in which purchases are typically planned are those where consumers engage in more "intentional learning," including active search and memorization of exact prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mazumdar and Monroe 1990)</ref>. Therefore, prices for planned purchase products are easier to recall from memory and historical benchmark prices dominate <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mazumdar and Papatla 2000)</ref>. In contrast, impulse buying involves reaction to contextual cues, such as the point-of-purchase prices of the product and its competitors, with little effort to retrieve relevant information from memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hausman 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Hypothesis 3B. Price elasticity beyond the gain threshold is more negative for planned purchases.</p><p>Planned purchases occur for products the consumer needs, which render them less sensitive to very small price changes. Faced with huge price gains, though, consumers should feel comfortable stocking up on products they planned to buy anyway. In contrast, impulse-buy products are purchased as the result of an impulsive decision, possibly triggered even by minor price gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chandon et al. 2000)</ref>. However, large price gains are not expected to strongly impact demand: Consumers would feel reluctant to buy large quantities, as the purchase was not planned and is thus unlikely to reflect an important consumer need <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wertenbroch 1998)</ref>. In case of strong price increases, some consumers would still buy the product due to strong desire. As a result, saturation effects are more likely for impulse-buy products.</p><p>Hypothesis 4. Price elasticity beyond the gain threshold is more negative for storable products.</p><p>A similar rationale applies for storable products, in this case concerning the opportunity of consumers to engage in strategic behavior. Small price gains are not expected to drive demand, as the nonperishable stocks at home allow consumers to lie in wait for great deals. When such great deals arrive, consumers can buy large quantities and stock them for the future.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Briesch et al. (1997)</ref> invite formal testing of two factors that may moderate the prominence of historical benchmarks: category price spread and product purchase cycle.</p><p>Hypothesis 5. Historical benchmarks are more prominent for categories with a high price spread.</p><p>A high price spread in the category indicates a strong degree of product differentiation, making it easier for consumers to remember prices of a specific brand. In contrast, a low price spread may confuse a consumer's memory concerning a specific brand's past prices: "Some consumers probably judged past prices as not sufficiently diagnostic to be stored in memory" <ref type="bibr">(Briesch et al. 1997, p. 213</ref>). Hypothesis 6. Historical benchmarks are more prominent for categories with a short purchase cycle.</p><p>Shorter purchase cycles simply make it easier for consumers to memorize prices and access this information when making a purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alba et al. 1991</ref>). In the words of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Briesch et al. (1997)</ref>: "For some consumers, longer intervals between purchases may have caused past prices to be less readily accessible in memory and not used in price judgments" (p. 213).</p><p>In contrast to the formal hypotheses on category moderators, we do not find strong arguments for brand moderators 3 but still include those in the analysis to explore their effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Size of Thresholds for Gains and Losses.</head><p>Turning to the size of the thresholds, previous literature suggests that focal cues, including price, are perceived within the behavioral situation of contextual cues such as brand familiarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Monroe 1977)</ref>, brand expensiveness, and promotional frequency of the brand and its competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Srinivasan et al. 2004</ref>). We discuss these moderating factors in turn.</p><p>First, brand familiarity might be due to external communication for or due to direct experience with the brand. The former is more likely for national brands versus store brands because national brands are more likely to adopt widespread advertising campaigns. The latter, consumer brand experience, is often operationalized at the market level as brand market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ehrenberg 1988</ref>).</p><p>Hypothesis 7. National brands have (a) a lower threshold for gains but (b) a higher threshold for losses.</p><p>Hypothesis 8. High share brands have (a) lower threshold for gains but (b) a higher threshold for losses.</p><p>As for gains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gupta and Cooper (1992)</ref> observed that price decreases are less likely to be discounted for national brands than for store brands. Indeed, external communication engenders brand loyalty and brand preference. Therefore, the threshold for gains should be lower for national brands as consumers will react favorably to even a small gain provided by a highly reputable brand. The same reasoning applies for brand market share: Previous experience creates familiarity with the brand and yields a large consumer base to react to price gains.</p><p>As for losses, price increases on familiar brands are more likely to be tolerated than those on unfamiliar brands. Indeed, national brands invest more in communications aimed at building differentiation and consumer loyalty. Likewise, high market share provides a good indication of consumer experience with a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ehrenberg 1988</ref>) and brands with a high market share are more likely to operate on the flat portion of the price-demand curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blattberg et al. 1995)</ref>. As a result, the sales elasticity for small price hikes is likely to be lower for large-share brands versus small-share brands.</p><p>Hypothesis 9. Expensive brands have (a) a lower threshold for gains but (b) a higher threshold for losses.</p><p>Expensive brands enjoy an asymmetric drawing power of their promotions, as their price discounts evoke more consumer reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989)</ref>. Therefore, we expect a lower threshold often invite direct comparison with competing brands (e.g., through "compare and save" tags) and are therefore more likely to be evaluated in terms of price comparisons with competitive brands at the point of purchase.</p><p>Marketing Science 26(1), pp. 83-100, © 2007 INFORMS for gains for more expensive brands. As for losses, expensive brands are more differentiated due to their higher perceived quality (possibly due to branding communication), and their sales should thus be more tolerant to losses as consumers are more likely to be willing to pay for the perceived differences. Therefore, we expect a higher threshold for losses.</p><p>Hypothesis 10.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modeling Threshold-Based Price Elasticity Transitions</head><p>In this section, we discuss the econometric representation of the model we use to examine thresholdbased transitions in short-run price elasticity. First, we introduce an error-correction model that allows us to consistently estimate the short-run price elasticity, even in the presence of nonstationary behavior of the respective series and/or a long-run cointegrating relationship between them. In this model, we incorporate smooth transitions of price elasticity between an "inner" regime close to the benchmark and "outer" regimes of gains and losses. Next, we adapt the smooth transition methodology to allow for (1) historical and competitive benchmarks, and (2) for asymmetric elasticity differences in the gains and losses regimes. Finally, we investigate whether the characteristics of threshold-based price elasticity systematically vary according to product category and brand conditions.</p></div>

Because our weekly scanner data might show distributed lag and/or purchase reinforcement effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hanssens et al. 2001)</ref>, it is useful to include lagged sales and prices as additional explanatory variables, resulting in the following specification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ln S t = 0 + 1 ln P t + 2 ln S t−1 + 3 ln P t−1 + t (1)</formula><p>where t denotes a white-noise residual term.

First, it might be difficult to directly interpret the parameters; for example, the total elasticity of S t with respect to P t−1 is not given by 3 . Second, when one or both variables are nonstationary (e.g., when their data-generating process has a unit root), the statistical analysis of Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is no longer straightforward, and care should be exerted to avoid the wellknown spurious-regression problem documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Granger and Newbold (1986)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Incorporating Price Gap-Induced</head><p>Threshold-Based Effects: Smooth Transition Models Model (3) still assumes a constant short-run price elasticity. We therefore apply smooth-transition regression modeling as a flexible procedure that allows both for threshold-based elasticities and the formal identification of the transition point and/or path between different elasticity regimes. Specifically, we propose that the price elasticity can take on different values depending on the size of the gap GAP t between the focal brand's current price and a benchmark price (defined below). To that extent, we can write model (3) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ln S i t = c + 0 + F GAP t 0 ln P i t + J −1 j=1 j ln P j t + 1 F EAT i t + 2 DISP i t + 1 ln S i t−1 − 2 ln P i t−1 + i t (4)</formula><p>where F GAP t is a continuous transition function bounded between zero and one.</p><p>Model (4) can be interpreted in two ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Van Dijk et al. 2002</ref>). On the one hand, it can be thought of as a regime-switching model that allows for two possible regimes, a short-run price elasticity of 0 versus 0 + 0 , associated with the respective extreme values of the transition function, F GAP t = 0 and F GAP t = 1, and where the transition of one regime to another can be smooth. On the other hand, one could also look at model ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) as allowing for a continuum of elasticity values, each associated with a different value of F GAP t between zero and one. In this paper, we adopt the regime interpretation (i.e., price is either inside or outside the inner regime around a benchmark price, as operationalized below), with a smooth transition between both regimes. Often, the number of observations in the transition phase is not large and hence it seems most useful to focus on the price elasticity in the two regimes before and after the transition rather than on the price elasticity in the transition phase itself. The functional form of F GAP t can be logistic, implying a single transition between two regimes, or quadratic logistic, implying two transition points. The latter specification is more relevant to our research problem, as we aim to model both a lower threshold (negative price gap; consumer gain) and a higher threshold (positive price gap; consumer loss). Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) displays such quadratic specification, with a lower threshold 1 and an upper threshold 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F GAP t = 1 1 + exp − GAP t − 1 GAP t − 2 &gt; 0 (5)</formula><p>Based on our discussion of previous marketing literature, we adapt this quadratic specification by allowing for (1) asymmetric price elasticity and threshold sizes for gains and losses, and (2) different benchmarks (historical versus competitive) to define the price gap. The former phenomenon (threshold asymmetry) is incorporated by distinguishing a lower threshold G with elasticity change for consumer gains G , and an upper threshold L , with elasticity change for consumer losses L . The latter phenomenon is modeled by incorporating two transition functions: one for historical prices and one for competitive prices. Each function allows for asymmetric effects for gains versus losses. Therefore, we substitute 0 in Equation (3) with the following expression:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">0 + G HBP 1 + exp log P t − log P t−1 − G HBP −1 + L HBP 1 + exp − log P t − log P t−1 − L HBP −1 + G CBP 1+exp P t − 1 J −1 J −1 1 P t 1 J −1 J −1 1 P t − G CBP −1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">+ L CBP 1+exp − P t − 1 J −1 J −1 1 P t 1 J −1 J −1 1 P t − L CBP −1</formula><p>(6) with 0 the constant price elasticity in the "inner regime" G L around the benchmark price; HBP and CBP the additional price elasticity outside this regime for, respectively, the historical and the competitive benchmark price definition; G HBP G CBP &lt; 0, and L HBP , L CBP &gt; 0 the price thresholds for, respectively, gains and losses; and parameter &gt; 0 the smoothness of the transition curve. The transition is typically smooth; → is a special case corresponding to an abrupt transition.

In contrast, the positive value of L HBP implies saturation effects, i.e., a lower price sensitivity beyond the upper threshold. Moreover, the threshold size is asymmetric as well: G differs from − L .</p></div>

In case one of the LR tests is significant, we proceed with that particular nonlinear model. If both tests are significant, we proceed with the model where 0 is given by Equation (6).</p><p>Within the selected model for each brand, we next test for asymmetry in threshold size and elasticity transition from one regime to the other is virtually immediate.

We assess this asymmetry with a binomial test for the estimated parameters G = − L and G = L .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Comparison to Other Models with</head><p>Nonconstant Price Elasticity Evidently, the assumption of constant price elasticities has been relaxed in prior work. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For one, marketshare attraction models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cooper and Nakanishi 1988</ref>) imply a particular form of nonconstant elasticities and price comparison with competing brands. However, they do not allow us to investigate the nature of the price thresholds (historical versus competitive benchmarks) nor their size. Second, varying coefficient models such as the semiparametric approach in van Heerde et al. ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>) and the stochastic spline-regression approach in Kalyanam and Shively (1998) allow for a completely datadriven approximation of the effect curve to capture threshold-based effects. These approaches are extremely flexible, thereby reducing the possibility of model misspecification bias. However, their data requirements quickly become excessive and their parameters are hard to directly interpret; hence, systematic comparisons across brands and product categories, needed for the derivation of empirical generalizations and hypothesis testing, become cumbersome to implement. In comparison, we feel that our methodology is well-suited for our research goal of establishing empirical generalizations on thresholdbased price elasticity across a wide range of fastmoving consumer good categories.</p></div>

Moreover, for historical benchmarks, we find significant differences for both the threshold size and the elasticity change for gains versus losses. Competitive benchmark thresholds show no such significant asymmetry.

For historical benchmark prices, the threshold size is larger for gains (23%) than for losses (15%), consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Han et al. (2001)</ref>. Interestingly, we find increased price sensitivity for gains (−0 91), but decreased price sensitivity for losses (0.32). The former is consistent with lie-in-wait behavior for deals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mela et al. 1997)</ref>. The latter represents saturation effects for price increases, which mirror the saturation effects for price discounts reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">van Heerde et al. (2001)</ref>. For competitive benchmark prices, the threshold size is about the same for gains (15%) and for losses (17%), and saturation effects emerge both for gains (0.49) and for losses (0.63). In other words, we find no latitude of acceptance compared to competitive benchmark. This is consistent with price recall studies showing that consumers could easily price rank competitors Notes. The regression results are based only on those brands with significant parameters for each type of benchmark price, i.e., n 1 = 48 for the historical and n 2 = 37 for the competitive benchmark price, out of total n = 80 brands. The "elasticity difference gains" G is the elasticity change (from 0 ) beyond the gain threshold. Negative values signify more negative price elasticity and thus larger price sensitivity beyond the gain threshold. The "elasticity difference losses" L is the elasticity change (from 0 beyond the loss threshold. Positive values signify less negative price elasticity and thus smaller price sensitivity beyond the loss threshold. The "gain threshold " G is the percentage change in price beyond which the price elasticity changes. As this change is relative to the reference price, this value is by definition negative. The "loss threshold " L is the percentage change in price beyond which the price elasticity changes. As this change is relative to the reference price, this value is by definition positive. even if they did not encode exact prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dickson and Sawyer 1990)</ref>. As competitive prices are readily observed in the store, even small deviations from competitive benchmark prices may affect focal brand sales. Instead, a price much lower than competitors might not yield a huge sales hike for several reasons, including (1) consumer associations of lower quality, and (2) the loyal consumer base for competitive brands.</p></div>

In contrast, Column 3 demonstrates that historical benchmark prices more often play a role for categories with low price volatility and high price spread, and for planned purchase products with a short purchase cycle, in support of hypotheses Hypothesis 2A, Hypothesis 3A, Hypothesis 5, and Hypothesis 6. These findings corroborate the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Briesch et al. (1997)</ref>: Consumers' recall of past brand prices is better and more predictive of current prices if they are frequently exposed to prices that do not change often, that strongly differ from competing brands, and that are related to planned purchases.</p><p>As the current price represents a gain over the historical benchmark price (Column 5 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>), the price elasticity is more negative in expensive categories (Hypothesis 1B) and in categories with high price volatility (Hypothesis 2B). Interestingly, we observe similar effects for the brand moderators: Expensive brands with high price volatility 15 experience higher consumer response once the gain threshold is crossed. Both effects are consistent with our arguments for the category-level moderators: Substantial price discounts allow more budget-conscious consumers to buy expensive brands and "shock" consumers out of their lie-in-wait game for brands with high price volatility. Finally, products with a long purchase cycle face a more constant price promotional elasticity when bridging the gain threshold, as do concentrated categories with a high price spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Narasimhan et al. 1996)</ref>.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref> presents the moderator results for threshold size. First, based on the historical benchmark price (Columns 2-3), high-share brands have a larger threshold for gains and losses (in support of Hypothesis 7B). This result logically follows from the definition of price elasticity, as high-share brands need stronger price changes to affect their base price elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(van Heerde et al. 2003)</ref>. Second, the loss threshold is lower for brands with high price volatility, in support of Hypothesis 10B. In other words, saturation effects of price hikes set in later for brands that teach consumers to buy on deal <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mela et al. 1997)</ref>.</p><p>For competitive benchmark prices (Columns 4-5 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>), national brands have lower thresholds for gains, in support of Hypothesis 7A. Moreover, expensive brands have a lower threshold for gains and a higher threshold for losses (Hypotheses 9A, B). In contrast, brands with high price volatility have higher thresholds for gains and lower thresholds for losses (Hypotheses 10A, B). Finally, both the gain and loss thresholds are lower in categories with high price volatility, in support of Hypothesis 11B, but opposite to Hypothesis 11A. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> summarizes our hypotheses and findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Managerial Relevance of Price Thresholds</head><p>To illustrate the managerial relevance of price elasticity transitions, we report and contrast the price impact on performance under constant elasticity versus under threshold-based price elasticity. For this illustrative purpose, we select two different brands in the toothpaste category, showing evidence for historical and competitive benchmark prices, respectively, and with typical parameter estimates (detailed estimates are provided in Appendix A). Figures <ref type="figure">3 and 4</ref> compare the constant elasticity with the thresholdbased price elasticity for these brands.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates how the price sensitivity increases once the historical benchmark price gain threshold is crossed. In contrast, the price sensitivity decreases once the threshold for losses is crossed. Moreover, note the asymmetry in threshold sizes, with the gain threshold at 16% discount versus the losses threshold at 7% increase over the benchmark price. In managerial terms, the brand obtains more bang for the buck with, e.g., a 20% promotion than with a 10% promotion. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The opposite implication applies for price increases: One 10% price increase yields less % sales loss than two price increases of 5%. In contrast, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows saturation effects for both gains and losses over the competitive benchmark price: The price sensitivity decreases once the gain of 16% and loss threshold of 17% are crossed. Next, we calculate the effect of four "typical" price changes (based on their pricing history: 5%, 10%, 20%, and 25%) on (a) unit sales, (b) revenues (sales * retail price), and (c) retailer gross margin (sales * unit margin).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows that a 5% price change leads to identical sales, retailer revenue, and retailer margin response for both the historical benchmark price model and the constant elasticity model. Indeed, this price change is below the threshold for both gains and losses. For a 10% price change, the constant elasticity model estimates diverge from our model estimates for price increases (overestimating price response by 40%) but not for price decreases. Finally, a 20% price change clearly crosses the threshold for both gains and losses and thus yields substantial model estimate differences in both cases. For instance, the estimated sales response to 20% price discounts is 65% higher when the historical benchmark price effect is considered. Knowledge of such benchmark-based price thresholds is thus important to brand manufacturers, which have considerable control over their brand pricing policies given rather high retailer passthrough rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>. Interestingly, the impact of benchmark prices on retailer revenue and gross margin effect estimates are even stronger. Most notably, a 25% price hike decreases profit performance by 40% more under constant elasticity versus the HBP model. This difference between the two models is For the competitive benchmark price definition, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> shows that a 5% price change yields identical performance response for both the constant elasticity and the competitive benchmark price model. In other words, brand managers should beware that even small differences with competitive prices engage consumer response. Given the higher thresholds, even a 10% price change has similar effects for both models. In contrast, price changes of 25% result in  considerably lower sales response due to CBP-based saturation effects. The overestimation of sales effects by the constant elasticity model is 35% for gains and 45% for losses. Note that, though the threshold sizes are similar, the saturation effects are higher for losses versus gains. Again, retailer revenue and gross margin implications are in line with the sales implications but have a higher magnitude. These results are particularly relevant as retailers set prices for all competing brands and thus may influence competitive benchmark price directly by choosing either negative or positive cross-brand pass through <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Besanko et al. 2005)</ref>. When the retailer acts to maximize brandrelated profits, as observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pauwels (2007)</ref>, our analysis supports a retail policy of increasing competitive prices to make the brand's promotion stand out, but only up to the point when saturation effects set in. Evidently, when the retailer acts to maximize category profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zenor 1994)</ref>, further analysis is needed to determine the desirability of such policy. In summary, the constant elasticity model substantially underestimates the performance impact of large discounts over historical benchmark prices, and substantially overestimates the performance impact of large increases over historical benchmark prices and of price changes vis-à-vis competitive benchmark prices. Therefore, it is important for managers to account for assimilation/contrast effects and saturation effects, particularly once the threshold is crossed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and Future Research Directions</head><p>This study applied the methodology of smooth transition models to investigate the evidence for thresholdbased price elasticity across a wide range of fast-moving consumer good categories. Based on our analysis of the top 4 brands in 20 retail categories, we find that 29% demonstrate historical benchmark prices, 16% competitive benchmark prices, and 31% both. Therefore, we conclude that price thresholds do matter for the majority of the analyzed brands and categories. Moreover, in the case of historical benchmarks, we find evidence for asymmetric thresholds, and for different sign and magnitude of elasticity transitions, signaling the need to consider a broad framework of threshold-based price elasticities. For historical benchmark prices, the threshold size is larger for gains (23%) than for losses (15%) and the assimilation/contrast effects for gains (−0 91) are larger than the saturation effects for losses (0.32). For competitive benchmark prices, the threshold size is similar for gains (15%) and losses (17%), and saturation effects emerge both for gains (0.49) and for losses (0.63).</p><p>Finally, the second-stage analysis reveals the moderating role of both category and brand characteristics. As expected, category/product characteristics drive the basic dimensions of nonlinear price elasticity (nature of reference and kind of effects beyond the threshold), while brand characteristics influence the threshold location. Specifically, historical benchmark prices more often play a role for planned purchases and in categories with low price volatility, high purchase frequency, and high price spread. Beyond the historical gain threshold, price sensitivity increases more for categories and brands that are expensive and have volatile prices. In contrast, concentrated markets with long purchase cycles do not experience a strong increase in price sensitivity beyond the historical gain threshold. When price discounting, high-share brands face larger latitude of acceptance while concentrated markets show smaller latitude of acceptance. When raising prices, saturation effects set in later for highshare brands with low price volatility. As for competitive benchmark prices, saturation effects set in later for expensive brands with low price volatility and in categories with low price volatility. Most of these findings are consistent with the developed hypotheses based on previous marketing literature.</p><p>The managerial relevance of our findings is illustrated for two representative brands in the toothpaste category. Price changes of 5% yield similar performance effects for the constant elasticity and the benchmark price models, as all threshold sizes exceed 5%. Once we increase the price change to cross the respective (asymmetric) thresholds, the constant elasticity model estimates start to differ substantially from those of our selected models. In particular, the constant elasticity model substantially underestimates the performance impact of large discounts over historical benchmark prices, and substantially overestimates the performance impact in all other cases. In other words, the smooth transition model captures both strong and subtle threshold-based performance response near the asymmetric threshold for gains and losses.</p><p>This study has several limitations which provide promising areas for future research. First, our empirical evidence is based on data for one chain in one geographical market. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether our findings apply to different retail settings and whether incorporating competing retailers' prices matters. Second, we did not model consumer heterogeneity, as we aimed to generate market-level guidelines for fast-moving consumer good retailers who have limited ability to price discriminate. Third, we did not model the role of feature and display on benchmark price elasticity. Likewise, richer data sets would allow us to account for threshold-based response to changes in other marketing-mix variables such as advertising. Fourth, our model could be expanded by allowing for more than three regimes of threshold-based elasticity. This extension would allow empirical assessment of the doubly kinked price response curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gutenberg 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Hruschka 2000</ref>. Fifth, our modeling approach can be used to investigate threshold-based market share response (rather than sales response). Sixth, the estimation of thresholds in long-run price elasticity, and of including potential long-run relationships among competing prices, remain challenging areas for future research. Moreover, future research could allow for nonconstant relations between the price elasticities and the price thresholds and the second-stage characteristics as well as the potential endogeneity of these characteristics. Seventh, while the focus of the present study is on brand-level pricing issues, future research could address SKU-level pricing. Finally, analysis at the individual-consumer level is needed to validate suggested explanations of the observed threshold-based elasticities at the market level. In particular, such research can provide the basis for classifying threshold sizes, can incorporate storage effects directly, and can distinguish adaptation level from lie-in-wait effects and "discounting of discounts" from purchase limit perceptions.</p><p>Fine-tuning prices requires deeper knowledge of threshold-based price elasticity, and academic research has only started to address this pressing managerial issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bucklin and Gupta 1999)</ref>. To this end, the current paper provides market-level evidence on historical and competitive benchmark prices and of asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size and the sign and the magnitude of the elasticity difference. Moreover, the specifics of threshold-based price elasticity differ systematically across brands and categories. Especially retailers may benefit from these specific results, as they set all competitive prices in a category. Therefore, they are able to adapt the competitive benchmark price to either reduce the sales impact of price increases or enhance brand sales response to price discounts. Together with research on dynamic pricing effects, such knowledge enables the move toward an optimization model for retail price fine tuning across brands and categories.  Note. The decision rule is as follows: If the p value is smaller than 0.05 for both HBP and CBP, then the decision is "HBP and CBP." If the p value is larger for one of these, then the decision is either "HBP" or "CBP." If both are larger, then the decision is the "linear" model. Remark. Due to multicollinearity, it can happen that the joint tests for HBP and CBP are significant, while they are not individually. Also, for the same reasons, the joint test can be insignificant, while the separate tests are significant.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1 A Graphical Illustration of Smooth Transition Model of Price Elasticity</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">As we analyze price thresholds at the market level, we prefer the term "benchmark price" instead of "reference price," which typically implies a reference point at the individual consumer level.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Throughout the paper, we use "higher" and "lower" price sensitivity as synonyms of "more negative" and "less negative" price elasticity, i.e., these terms do not signify absolute price effects on sales(Hanssens et al. 2001, p. 95).</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For one, the moderating role of brand ownership is not a priori obvious. On the one hand, store brand buyers are more likely to be price conscious and give less weight to nonprice attributes. This attention to price should enable price recall and thus lead to more use of historical benchmarks. On the other hand, store brands</note>

This finding is also consistent with recent VAR-based studies in which the typical number of lags for models estimated in frequently purchased consumer goods was one (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Srinivasan et al. 2004, Pauwels and</ref>).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">This is because the first differences of logged variables are approximately growth rates.7  This does not apply to our specific empirical application, as none of the analyzed sales and price series is classified as evolving by (Augmented Dickey Fuller) unit root tests. We note, too, that while thresholds may also exist in long-run price elasticity, we leave this topic for future research.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">We do not base our model selection on the AIC criterion because the AIC compares models where if one model is the true one, then strictly speaking the alternative model contains parameters that cannot be estimated. In contrast, with the LR tests, all parameters exist under the null and the alternative hypothesis.10  The expressions of the full and restricted models (in Eviews code) are available from the first author's website at http://mba.tuck. dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/koen.pauwels/research.html.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="14">We choose to analyze price response at the brand level, given our research goal of establishing empirical generalizations across a wide range of fast-moving consumer good categories. However, we verified for the cola category that if a brand shows evidence of nonlinear price response, all its SKUs do, too.</note>

The high correlation between these two measures prevents us from assessing their separate effects in one model.</note>
