<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W ith $40 billion in annual gross merchandise volume, electronic auctions comprise a substantial and growing sector of the retail economy. Using unique data on Celtic coins, we estimate a structural model of buyer and seller behavior via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with data augmentation. Results indicate that buyer valuations are affected by item, seller, and auction characteristics; buyer costs are affected by bidding behavior; and seller costs are affected by item characteristics and the number of listings. The model enables us to compute fee elasticities even though there is no variation in fees in our data. We find that commission elasticities exceed per item fee elasticities because they target high-value sellers and enhance their likelihood of listing. By targeting commission reductions to high-value sellers, auction house revenues can be increased by 3.9%. Computing customer value, we find that attrition of the largest seller would decrease fees paid to the auction house by $97. Given the seller paid $127 in fees, competitive effects offset only 24% of those fees. In contrast, competition offsets 81% of the buyer attrition effect. In both events, the auction house would overvalue its customers by neglecting competitive effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Commensurate with the ascendancy of the Internet, e-commerce has witnessed explosive growth. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report (2006), U.S. e-commerce retail sales increased by 25.4% while retail sales across all channels grew at a more restrained 8.1%. Much of this growth is due to online auctions. For example, eBay alone had 276 million confirmed registered users by the end of 2007. These users generated a gross merchandise volume of $16.2 billion across 637 million auctions during the 4th quarter of 2007, a year-over-year growth rate of 12%. This compares to quarterly sales of roughly $100 billion in the U.S. grocery industry <ref type="bibr">(First Research 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Concurrent with this growth, empirical/econometric research on the design and conduct of auctions has seen increased attention in marketing of late <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chakravarti et al. 2002)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Park and Bradlow (2005, p. 470)</ref> analyze "whether, who, when and how much" to bid under an online auction context; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chan et al. (2007)</ref> consider bidders' willingness to pay for an auction; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bradlow and Park (2007)</ref> investigate how bidders' behaviors evolve over the course of an auction. This research has led to some important insights about the nature of bidder behavior in auctions. We extend this empirical literature by considering the behavior of sellers at the auction site. An integrated analysis of bidder and seller behavior has pivotal implications for the marketing policies of the auction house, such as the fees it sets, the rules it uses to conduct the auction, or an assessment of the value of its customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Greenleaf and Sinha 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Given our interest in seller behavior and its attendant policy implications, we focus on structural models of auction behavior. Such models enable one to ascertain unobserved characteristics of bidders and sellers, such as their latent costs of bidding and listing and their ramifications for auction fees, mechanism design, and/or customer value. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Like the marketing literature to which we alluded above, structural model research in the context of auctions has largely focused on bidder behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Reiss and Wolak 2005)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bajari and Hortacsu (2003)</ref> propose a structural model to explore the determinants of bidding behaviors. Their paper assesses the effects of endogenous bidder entry into an auction and is among the first to model structural bidding behavior in the context of electronic auctions. Thus, it forms a cornerstone of the bidder model in our research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jofre-Bonet and Pesendorfer (2003)</ref> consider dynamic bidding behavior arising from capacity constraints in a repeated procurement auction game. They find these constraints lead to higher 862 Marketing Science 27(5), pp. <ref type="bibr">861-885, © 2008 INFORMS</ref> bids because a winning bid increases capacity constraints in the subsequent period; this reduced incentive to win is commensurate with higher bids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Campo et al. (2002)</ref> investigate an auction model with possible risk-averse bidders and propose a semiparametric estimation procedure to test the risk neutrality of bidders. There is also a rich literature focusing on the question of identification of empirical auction models, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Paarsch (1992)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guerre et al. (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Athey and Haile (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hong and Shum (2002)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haile et al. (2003)</ref>. In sum, this literature has further enriched our insights about strategic buying behavior in the context of auctions.</p><p>Our model supplements the structural auctions literature in a number of regards: First, we integrate both bidder and seller behavior; that is, we do not presume seller behavior regarding the number of items to list to be exogenous. In practice, both bidders and sellers are strategically interactive, and it is reasonable to suspect that the market equilibrium is determined by their interactions. The integration of bidder and seller behavior in auctions is an example of a two-sided market, wherein multiple parties interact on a platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rochet and</ref><ref type="bibr">Tirole 2006, Tucker 2005)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rochet and Tirole (2006)</ref>, the twosided network as well as the period payment flows between the various agents can be depicted graphically as indicated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a). Though there is a rich theoretical literature on these two-sided markets, empirical research remains nascent <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roson 2005)</ref>. We contribute to this empirical literature by assessing (a) how these markets should be priced, (b) the value of agents in these markets, and (c) an empirical analysis of two-sided markets in the context of auctions. Second, we accommodate heterogenous bidding disutilities/costs across bidders. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As a result, we can infer how changes in the listing behavior of the seller affect each bidder's likelihood of bidding in any given auction. Summing these behaviors across bidders and auctions yields the total auction revenue conditioned on seller listings. Third, we incorporate heterogeneity in seller costs. Heterogeneity in costs implies that the number of auctions listed can change in response to bidders' valuations or auction house fees. Fourth, we integrate Bayesian statistics and structural models in the context of auctions, which is relatively novel in marketing and economics. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The Bayesian approach enables considerable flexibility in model specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rossi et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Together, these innovations enable us to assess how changes in auction house strategies (such as fee schedules or auction design) affect the number of auctions and the corresponding bidding behaviors even in the absence of any observed variation in these strategies. For example, using the seller costs and bidder valuations, one can assess how fee changes affect the number of items that sellers list. This in turn affects the number of items on which bidders bid. As a result, the auction house can forecast the effect of fee changes on the equilibrium number of items listed by sellers and the prices that buyers pay for these items. Closing prices and the number of items listed factor into the auction house revenue. In this manner it is possible to compute price elasticities for the auction house fees to evaluate its pricing strategy. In contrast, it is difficult to assess these elasticities by regressing seller listings and closing prices on fees because there is often little variation in fees from which to infer changes in auction demand and prices. eBay, for example, changes its fees about once per year, leaving few observations from which to infer price response. Moreover, to infer price response, one would need to use observations about fee changes that are many years old, and it is unclear whether data from the distant past remain valid given the changing sample composition of customers over time.</p><p>Using the imputed price-demand system, we conclude (via a pricing policy experiment wherein we manipulate auction house prices) that changing fees can increase auction house revenue by 3.9% with a targeted pricing strategy and 2.9% with a uniform pricing strategy. Much of this gain arises from emphasizing per item fees over commissions. Lower commissions disproportionately attract higher-value items by increasing per item profits. This further suggests that categories with a greater prevalence of high-value items such as art should emphasize per item fees over commissions. Figure <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref> shows the pricing policy experiment graphically in the context of the two-sided market.</p><p>A corollary benefit of the foregoing innovations is that they enable one to assess the short-term value of a customer in a two-sided market. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Information about customer value is useful for assessing how much to invest in retaining a customer (exemplified via a targeted coupon or rebate from the auction house). A common approach toward assessing customer value is to tally the total commissions and fees the seller pays to the auction house. However, were that seller to depart the system, some bidders would switch to other sellers. Moreover, with less competition, the remaining sellers are inclined to list more items. Both behaviors affect equilibrium prices. A proper accounting of these competitive effects offsets about 24% of the fees paid by a departing seller. An analogous argument can be constructed for valuing buyers. The revenue lost from the attrition of a buyer is offset by the remaining bidders who bid on the items that the attriting buyer would have purchased. In addition, the departure of a buyer can incent a seller to reduce listings in response to a decrease in the expected price he or she will receive. We find other bidders bidding on the items of the attrited buyer offset about 81% of the lost revenue from the attrited buyer. Stated differently, valuing agents without regard to competitive interactions overstates the value of the seller by one-third and the value of a buyer by more than 400%. These conclusions arise from a policy experiment wherein we assess the impact of an attrited customer on equilibrium revenue. This policy experiment is reflected graphically in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(c). Note that Figures <ref type="figure">1(a</ref>)-1(c) suggest that our model could also be useful in addressing further policy experiments, such as assessing the profitability of auction fees to the buyer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Behavior in a Two-Sided Market In sum, explicitly considering seller and bidder behavior in a joint system or two-sided market enables one to (a) attain a better understanding of how sellers make listing decisions and (b) engage policy simulations to help the auction house implement its marketing strategies. With these goals in mind, the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the bidding mechanism used by many online auction houses. This characterization motivates the structure of the game. Next, we present our data and some exploratory analyses to develop insights about auction behavior, especially with respect to the interaction between bidders and sellers. We then detail the model and corresponding estimation approach in § §3 and 4. Results of this model are detailed in §5. Based on these results, §6 provides an overview of the managerial implications, including the impact of fee changes, valuing customers, and gauging the effect of a seller's reputation in auctions. Section 7 concludes the paper with a summary of findings, limitations, and future research directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The E-Auction Context and Data</head><p>A necessary precursor to modeling auction behavior is a complete characterization of the process of listing and bidding an item. Hence, in this section, we preface our model discussion with a characterization of the data and auction mechanism. As the firm supplying the data wishes to remain anonymous, we describe the process in somewhat general terms, beginning with the decisions of the seller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Rules of the Auction House and</head><p>Participants' Decision Processes 2.1.1. Listing. A seller begins an auction by listing an item online. To list an item, the seller must be registered with the auction firm and pay a small listing fee. For an additional fee, sellers can also opt to list features such as product pictures, the duration of the auction, a secret reserve price, etc. Secret reserves enable a seller to retain the listed item if the highest bid fails to exceed the reserve, which is not revealed to bidders. In addition to these listing features, experienced sellers (by virtue of interactions with past buyers) can also garner reputation ratings. Previously successful buyers can provide positive, negative, or neutral ratings for the seller, based on the buyer's experience with the transaction.</p><p>If the auction successfully concludes, the seller pays a commission and listing fee to the firm. If not, the seller is responsible only for a listing fee. Other seller costs include acquisition costs and shipping. We presume sellers' listing strategies (whether and how many items to list) are selected to maximize the seller's profit. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> overviews the decision of sellers. The links in the figure, denoted S1-S8, reflect the processes modeled in this paper. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>The Seller Decision The bidding mechanism used by the auction house is called "proxy bidding." With proxy bidding, a bidder enters an auction prior to its conclusion and submits his or her bid. The website will then act as a "proxy" to bid for the bidder by entering a bid on behalf of the user whenever the user is outbid (to some pre-determined maximum level). For example, assume a bidder intends to bid no more than $10.00 for a given item. Suppose further that the item's current price is $1.00, with a bid increment of $0.50. By submitting a $10.00 proxy bid to the website, the auction site enters a bid of $1.50 on behalf of the bidder. If another bidder enters and bids $5.00, the proxy bid automatically becomes $5.50. If a subsequent bid of $15.00 materializes, the high bid changes to $10.50 and the first bidder receives an e-mail notification that he or she was outbid. The bidder can then choose whether to increase the bid or quit the auction.</p><p>On placing the highest bid, the bidder wins the auction and makes a payment to the seller that equals the second highest bid. It is the responsibility of the seller and the winning bidder to settle payment and delivery issues. We presume that a bidder's bidding strategy (whether and how much to bid) is selected to maximize expected profits. More specifically, we assume the bidder will bid if the expected return from doing so exceeds the cost. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> overviews the bidding decision process. The links in the figure, denoted B1-B10, reflect the bidder behaviors we model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1.3.</head><p>Seller-Bidder Interactions. The foregoing discussion suggests why it is desirable to model bidder and seller behaviors jointly. First, the bidder's  costs and returns affect the optimal bidding levels and decisions to bid. Strategic sellers form expectations about bidding levels and bidder costs. Predicated on these expectations, sellers make listing decisions. Bidders, who are also strategic, in turn make bidding decisions conditional on the seller's listing behavior. Hence, seller and bidder decisions are interdependent. Accordingly, the auction house directly affects the seller's profits and the number of items sellers list by varying its auction fees. The effects of a fee change propagate to bidders by altering the decisions of sellers. To exemplify this point, we next describe our data and present some descriptive statistics about bidderseller interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data</head><p>We use a unique data set generously presented by an international auction house that prefers to remain anonymous. The focal category is collectible Celtic coins. We selected this category because it is fairly isolated, inasmuch as bidders in this category tend not to buy other types of coins. This mitigates considerations of seller and bidder behavior in other categories. The data were collected from November 2004 to April 2005 and encompass 816 auctions 5 listed by 57 sellers over 189 days. Of these listings, 72.2% were finally sold. There were 925 bidders. The auction data comprise several files, including a listing file, a bidding file, and a demographics file for the bidders and sellers. We describe each in turn.</p><p>2.2.1. Listing File. The listing data include, for each item, the unique seller ID, a text description of the item, and the item's listing characteristics. These characteristics include "picture," whether the seller includes at least one picture of the item in their listing; "subtitle," a paid feature which presents detailed descriptions under the listing title; "gallery picture," an icon-size picture of the item beside the title when the auction is presented by the search engine; "store," which enables a seller to group items on a single Web page; "bold," in which the auction title is shown as bold characters; and "featured listing," wherein the item listing is displayed near the top of the searching results. For each listing, we also observe the exact value of the secret reserve price, if chosen by the seller. We include the percentage statistics of the listing features in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. This table shows that the characteristics "bold," "featured listing," and "secret reserve" are seldom used by sellers.</p><p>To obtain the prevailing market prices of listed items, we collect the data from two sources. The first is an online coins catalog (www.vcoins.com), which is widely recognized in the coin collectoring community. A second source is the book Coins of England and the United Kingdom, Standard Catalogue of British Coins (41st ed.). We report the price information together with some other listing information in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>The final price is close to book value. While auction durations vary from 1 day to 10 days, most auctions last 7 days. Hence, we define the interval of  analysis (e.g., whether to list) to be weekly. All auctions use an open reserve price, denoted minimum bid, that is observed by all buyers. A handful of sellers (2.3%) also use a secret reserve. Though its level is not known to the bidders, the presence of a secret reserve is common knowledge and can therefore enter the bidder utility function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Bidding File.</head><p>The bidding data include a detailed bidding history of each unique bidder ID through the six months. Thus we observe every bid a bidder submits and the time the bid was made. This includes the highest bid that occurred in each auction, which is not normally observed for most sealed second-price online auction data. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> presents some summary statistics of the data.</p><p>The majority of bidders only attend one auction per week, suggesting that purchases are not concentrated in the hands of a few buyers. We also observe little evidence of buyer reselling, as no bidders are cross listed as sellers and they tend to purchase only one coin at a time. In addition, the total number of items listed is dominated by a few large sellers. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Together, these observations reflect a market comprised of many collectors buying from a set of dealers; it is therefore appropriate to model the bidders and sellers as different agents. The lapse since last winning varies dramatically across bidders and suggests the importance of capturing heterogeneity across bidders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Demographic File:</head><p>Seller and Buyer Feedback. The demographic file includes demographic information for sellers and bidders. With the exception of participants' feedback scores, these demographics are incomplete, so we focus only on feedback scores. We report the feedback scores in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>. Among the participants population, 5.5% are females, 53.6% are males, and the balance did not report their gender.</p><p>Although feedback scores for both sellers and bidders evidence considerable variation, the scores for sellers are more diverse. Also, as a group, sellers have a higher mean and median feedback score than bidders, which suggests that sellers are more active and experienced than bidders.  3. An Integrated Model of Bidders and Sellers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Key Assumptions and Nomenclature</head><p>We detail a number of assumptions used to make our modeling approach more efficient. Most are standard assumptions in the literature. These are as follows: First, we assume a private value (PV) auction. The assumptions of a PV auction and a common value (CV) auction lead to different interpretations of the data and methods of inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Milgrom and Weber 1982)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> To justify the PV assumption, we use the empirical test first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Milgrom and Weber (1982)</ref>. The method is also discussed and implemented in other literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Athey and Haile 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bajari and Hortacsu 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Haile et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Paarsch 1992</ref>. The idea of the test is to exploit the relationship between the number of bidders and bids. With the existence of the "winner's curse" in CV auctions, the average bids in an N -bidder auction should be lower than a N − 1 -bidder auction. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> In comparison, such a relationship does not hold under a PV assumption. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, we present the results from two instrumentvariable (IV) regressions of (log) bids on (log) number of bidders. The first regression uses all bids, and the second only uses the last bids of each bidder. Using (log) minimum bid, "bold," and "featured listing" as instruments for the number of bidders, the regression coefficients for the number of bidders on prices are positive and significant. Thus, we proceed with the PV assumption in our structural empirical model. Under the PV assumption, auctions reduce to a second price, sealed-bid auction <ref type="bibr">(Vickrey 1961, Milgrom and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Weber 1982)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we assume bidders' private valuation signals for a given item are drawn independently from <ref type="bibr">7</ref> There are two types of auctions based on the degree of independence across bidders' valuation for an auctioned item: PV and CV. In a PV model, bidders evaluate the item independently from others, and such valuations are private information. Knowledge of others' valuations does not affect one's own valuation. In contrast, the CV model assumes all bidders' valuations are identical ex post (even though each bidder may have an idiosyncratic ex ante valuation). the value distribution, another common assumption in the literature, denoted independent value. Given the context of bidders bidding on modestly priced items over the Internet (with dispersed bidders and limited interpersonal contact), we also believe this to be a reasonable assumption. Note that this assumption does not imply that valuations are independent, as changes in the mean of the distribution affect all bidders. For example, the seller use of a gallery can affect all buyers' valuations. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reiss and Wolak (2005)</ref>, the alternative assumption of affiliated values has seen scant attention because it is difficult to characterize the equilibria of these auctions (requiring additional strict assumptions). Thus, like most research that precedes ours, we model an independent private value (IPV) auction on the bidder side. Third, we consider a static game with bidders and sellers. This assumption is not as restrictive as it initially appears, as we can control for dynamics such as an intertemporal budget constraint via a reducedform approximation. We leave more formal resolution of the dynamic problem for future research; this would entail solving a dynamic program, ensuring the equilibrium is unique, and identifying this solution from the data, all of which may be a contribution in its own right, if feasible. As noted in our literature review, this is a prevalent assumption.</p><p>Fourth, we model cross-auction interdependence by specifying a diminishing marginal value for each additional auction attended. In contexts wherein bidders routinely bid on multiple concurrent auctions, there exists the potential for other interdependencies in strategic bidding behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brusco and Lopomo 2006)</ref>. However, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> shows that there is little multiple auction bidding, suggesting that this is an appropriate approximation. Accommodating strategic cross-item bidding adds considerable complexity to the model with little attendant benefit given the limited occurrence of these events in our data.</p><p>Fifth, we assume the sellers' choices of listing features (e.g., reservation prices, gallery, etc.) are exogenously given. Endogenizing this decision admits a multiplicity of listing feature equilibria, rendering such a specification of little value for assessing how the pricing of features affects demand for these features. Moreover, endogenizing feature choices implies the need to compute an equilibrium for every set of features, which leads to the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes infeasible (or requiring an approximate as opposed to an exact solution). Thus, we leave it to future research in combinatorial optimization to assess whether this problem is resolvable and restrict our analysis to the effect of listing fees and commissions. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We note prior research considers seller behavior to be altogether exogenous.</p><p>Sixth, our model estimation assumes that bidders and sellers are fully informed about the number of bidders in the market and about the bidder valuation and bidder cost distributions. The assumption that bidders and sellers are aware of the value distribution may be a reasonable approximation in light of their ability to monitor auction outcomes over time by observing historical bids on the website. Most preceding research makes this assumption on the bidder side, and we extend this precedent to the seller side. The number of sellers and bidders can also be observed from the website. We explore the assumption that sellers and bidders are fully informed about the buyer cost distribution by estimating a model wherein we assume their knowledge is limited only to the mean of this distribution. We find this model leads to a 0.9% decrease in the log marginal likelihood. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For our policy simulations we invoke the additional assumption that sellers form expectations about the number of sellers in the market and the distribution of seller costs.</p><p>Seventh, we assume risk-neutral and symmetric bidders, consistent with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bajari and Hortacsu 2003)</ref>. Symmetry implies that 9 It is possible to endogenize the reservation price decision. A benefit of this approach is that such a model formalizes the decisionmaking process on the part of the seller. The cost is that endogenous reservation prices make the model more complex (i.e., introduce additional noise along with explanation). Given the trade-off, we test such a model and find that endogenizing reservation price has only a negligible effect on parameter estimates (the correlation between the median parameter estimates in this model and our base formulation is 0.985). Furthermore, the endogenous reservation price model evidences lower fit (by decreasing the log marginal likelihood for listings and bids from −21,278.41 to −22,150.82). Therefore, we do not pursue this development further in this paper. As an aside, endogenizing reservation prices leads to reservation pricing equilibria that may not be unique; thus, the model has more limited applicability in the context of policy simulations. bidders draw private valuations from the same distribution, ex ante. However, on receiving their signals, they differ in their individual valuations. Moreover, heterogeneity in bidder costs implies that bidders are asymmetric in their bidding utilities even when they ex ante have the same expected valuation for an item (as utility is value less costs). Accordingly, the symmetry assumption is not as restrictive as it may appear. Nonetheless, we explore this assumption following the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Athey et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Flambard and Perrigne (2006)</ref>, who posit that asymmetry in valuations arises from bidders' idiosyncratic characteristics. Following this approach, we regress final bids on observed bidder characteristics, including bidder feedback, time lapse since last bid, and time lapse since last win. We find none of these effects to be statistically significant, consistent with the assumption of symmetric bidders.</p><p>Eighth, we assume that the focal auction house is operating as a monopoly. We believe it is a reasonable approximation because of the dominant market share of the auction house in the category and market we consider. Its scale leads to strong network effects (for example, a seller can reach a large number of bidders), making it difficult for bidders and sellers to successfully buy and list items with competing houses and reducing the likelihood they will defect over a small change in fees. Evidence for this assumption is afforded by a small share competitor who lowered its fees with no effect on the share of the considered firm.</p><p>Ninth, we focus on behaviors within one category and abstract any cross-category bidding, listing implications (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Haile et al. 2003 and others)</ref>. We select our category of analysis to comport with this assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model Overview</head><p>We assume the bidder-seller game in any given period (e.g., weekly in our data) as follows:</p><p>• In Stage 0, each seller is endowed with some types of coins associated with a seller-item specific opportunity cost for acquiring the coin(s). For each type of coin, an optimal listing feature combination is exogenously determined by the item's and seller's characteristics. This combination of listing features, in conjunction with seller and item characteristics, determines the distribution of valuations of bidders about the item. Each bidder will then draw a valuation for the item from this distribution.</p><p>• In Stage 1, conditional on house fees, the acquisition costs, and the expected revenue, the seller assesses the expected return. The seller then decides whether to list and, if so, how many items to list for each type conditional on the expected returns. More specifically, we presume the seller lists the precise number of items that leads to the highest profit over all alternative numbers of items listed.</p><p>• In Stage 2, for each auction, each bidder decides whether to participate in the auction and, if so, submits the optimal bid. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bajari and Hortacsu (2003)</ref>, sniping (last-minute bidding) is the unique Bayesian-Nash equilibrium for online auctions, and, as a result, these auctions are equivalent to sealedbid second-price auctions. Even in the absence of sniping, when the IPV assumption sustains, auctions are equivalent to sealed-bid second-price auctions <ref type="bibr">(Vickrey 1961, Milgrom and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Weber 1982)</ref>; i.e., the timing of bid submission does not affect the optimal bidding strategy. Thus, we abstract away from withinauction bidding dynamics.</p><p>Given our assumption that the listing feature choice and cost function are exogenously determined in Stage 0, we only detail the game for Stage 1 (how many items to list) and Stage 2 (conditional on listings, how much to bid). We solve this problem using backward induction, beginning with the bidder model first. As a further prelude to our model, some clarifications of the indices we use are necessary. We define i = 1 2 I to indicate sellers and j = 1 2 J to denote the bidders in the market. Different types t = 1 2 T of items are available for auction (e.g., Celtic silver drachm of Alexander III versus Celtic silver tetradrachm of Philip II). The same seller can initiate multiple auctions for the same type of coin. We use n = 1 2 N to index auctions. , where v ijtn stands for bidder j's valuation for the item (e.g., a specific coin). We presume the bidder's valuation for a given type of item auctioned by a given seller remains the same across auctions; i.e., v ijtn = v ijtn . This ensures that the primary source of variation in unobserved valuations occurs across bidders as opposed to within bidder volatility in valuations, as the within-person variation is likely to be relatively constant over a short span of time (recall that we can allow longitudinal variation in bidder valuations via observed changes in item and seller characteristics in conjunction with listing features). We define it and as the value distribution mean and standard deviation, respectively. A natural candidate for the distribution g v ijtn it is a normal distribution. We assume that 11</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Minimum Bid, Disutility of Bidding, and Optimal Bidding Strategy.</head><p>Optimal Bidding Strategy. In addition to bidder valuations (link B5), two other factors affect bidder strategy. First, each auction has a minimum bid, MinBid it , which is common across the same items listed by a seller. MinBid it functions as a "reserve price," as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Milgrom and Weber (1982)</ref>. All submitted bids must be greater than the minimum bid (link B6). Second, each customer has a disutility of bidding, C b ijtn , which we express as a dollar metric and which can be interpreted as the bidder's "marginal cost" for bidding on one more item (we parameterize these costs in the next section). Higher costs reduce the likelihood of a bid on a given auction (link B7). This disutility can involve opportunity costs on time such as the efforts for researching and monitoring the auction as well as reflecting the opportunity cost of capital. Following an approach similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Milgrom and Weber (1982)</ref>, we obtain the following result.</p><p>Theorem 1. For a given auction itn having a minimum bid MinBid it , bidder j has bidding disutility C b ijtn . The optimal bidding strategy is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">b * v ijtn = v ijtn if v ijtn ≥ x * ijtn 0 otherwise (4)</formula><p>where x * ijtn is defined by the implicit function</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C b ijtn = x * ijtn −</formula><p>x * ijtn − max j MinBid it f j d j (5) where f j is the density function of j , the highest competing bid.</p><p>See Appendix A1, for the proof. Theorem 1 suggests that in equilibrium a bidder will only bid if his or her valuation for an item exceeds a certain threshold, x * ijtn , and, if it does, the bidder will bid the valuation, i.e., "truth telling" (links B8-B10). The bidding threshold, x * ijtn , is an increasing function of three factors: (a) the MinBid it , (b) the bidder cost, C b ijtn and, (c) the expected highest competing bid, j . As the MinBid it increases, only highervalue bidders will participate, increasing the expected closing price. Hence only higher-valuation bidders are likely to participate, thereby elevating the participation threshold. Second, higher bidder costs imply higher valuations are necessary to make a bid profitable. Thus, the bidding threshold increases with bidder costs. Third, x * ijtn is increasing in j . As an order statistic, j increases with the number of bidders; hence the bidding threshold rises with the number of bidders. Thus, the intensity of competition affects the likelihood of an individual's entry into an auction.</p><p>Bidder Costs, C b ijtn . The marginal disutility of bidding in a focal auction (link B4) is assumed to be bidder-auction specific and is specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">log C b ijtn = C b 0j + Z C b ijtn C b + e C b ijtn e C b ijtn ∼ N 0 1 Z C b ijtn = log AttendedAuction ijtn + 1 log Lapse ijtn (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where AttendedAuction is the total number of alternative auctions the bidder is attending during the duration of the focal auction; the "+1" ensures the log function is defined; Lapse is the time since the last win;</p><p>and var e C b ijtn = 1 to ensure identification of costs. 13</p><p>13 To see this, consider Equation (A.47) in Appendix A3. When variances are not constrained to 1, (A.47) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L ∝ ijtn exp − log C b ijtn − C b 0j − Z C b ijtn C b 2 2 2</formula><p>Because C b ijtn is not observed, this expression can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L ∝ ijtn exp − log C b ijtn / − C b 0j / − Z C b ijtn C b / 2 2</formula><p>from which it can be observed that the parameters are identified only up to a scale, analogous to a probit or logit model.</p><p>The Lapse variable reflects potential intertemporal dynamics in bidding behavior. Intertemporal dependence can also be induced by price or listing expectations. For example, rising expectations about the number of potential future listings might induce customers to delay purchases. In addition, the presence of an intertemporal budget constraint or an inventory constraint implies that bidders who recently won auctions may have less space or cash available to purchase on subsequent bidding occasions, thereby lowering their bidding likelihood (i.e., the marginal utility of bidding decreases as the time since a win decreases). Similarly, the AttendedAuction variable reflects the potential existence of a within-period budget or inventory constraint. In the event bidders have insufficient space or capital to accommodate multiple auction wins, their marginal likelihood of bidding in additional auctions will decrease (or else bidders will either bid on all available auctions-if their marginal value of bidding exceeds the marginal cost-or none).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C b</head><p>0j is a bidder-specific constant to account for heterogeneity in bidder costs. We use log costs to ensure that costs are positive.

Observations of positive bids reveal the bidder's valuation, which in turn helps to determine the cost. With costs known, together with our parametric costs specification, it becomes possible to infer values in auctions wherein bids are not observed (i.e., a bidder decides not to bid). In addition, costs have a common parametric specification across different items. For those observations with the same covariate values for bidder costs, the variation in bidder behavior across these items helps to identify bidder valuations, because differences in costs cannot explain differences in bidding behavior (as these costs are constant across bidders in this case).</p></div>

We first derive the expected revenue a seller obtains from listing an item (links S3 and S4 in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and then use this revenue in conjunction with seller costs (links S1 and S2) to derive the expected return for listing a specific number of items (links S5-S7) and the optimal number of items to list (link S8). • without Secret Reserve Price. For auctions without secret reserve prices, the seller receives the second highest bid when there are at least two bidders competing.

The term in the first set of braces represents the probability that J − 2 bids lie below ; the term in the second row represents the probability that the highest bid is greater than ; and the term in the third row is the probability that the second highest bid is . The integrals yield expectations over the unobserved bidder costs. The term J reflects the number of permutations in which can be the second highest bidder. Similarly, the term J − 1 reflects the fact that any bidder among the J − 1 bidders (J bidders less the second highest one) can be the highest bidder.</p><p>• Number of Bidders = 1.

The results developed in the case of no secret reserve can be generalized as follows to the case of a secret reserve. First, in the case of multiple bidders, if the second highest bid is lower than the secret reserve, the seller keeps the item. Thus the return is zero. Second, in the one bidder case, the seller retains the item because the winning bid must be MinBid it and is therefore lower than the secret reserve. 14 Hence, the expected return becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E R s itn it J = E it J ≥ Reserve it = Reserve it p it J d (11)</formula><p>3.4.2. The Seller Listing Decision. Seller Profits. Prior to bidding, the seller must decide whether to list an item, and if so, how many of the items to list. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> This decision is analogous to the seller choosing the optimal supply of goods at a subgame level. We assume that seller i's conditional expected profit given listing q it units of item t is: 16</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">it q it = q it • 1 − commission E R s itn • − C s it q it − q it • fee it (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where commission is the commission rate charged by the auction house; fee it is the unit listing fee paid to the auction site. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Other than the listing fees and commissions paid to the auction house, there exist acquisition or opportunity costs for an item. The cost is assumed to depend on the item's prevailing market value and the number of units listed, q it . Owing to finite supply, as the seller endeavors to source more units, acquisition becomes more difficult. This leads to an increase in the marginal opportunity cost of obtaining these items. Denote C s it q it as the total acquisition cost for listing q it units. Increasing marginal costs imply that C s it q it is convex in q it . Moreover, our specification implies that the expected revenue is quasiconcave in q it , which is a necessary condition for a concave profit function and ensures that an optimum exists. The seller's problem is to find the optimal q it that satisfies q it = arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">q it it q it (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>i.e., any deviation from q it (i.e., selling fewer or more items) will not result in a higher profit for the seller.</p><p>As q it can include zero, the decision of whether to list, and what number of items to list, is endogenous. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">13</ref>) indicates whether a given seller will list q it items. This decision is affected by the number of competing sellers and participating buyers. As the number of competing sellers increases, the total number of items listed to bidders can increase. Yet Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) places a constraint on the number of auctions in which a bidder can concurrently bid. In the presence of an increased number of items listed, this constraint lowers the likelihood that any given seller will be able to sell his or her items, as an increase in the total listings leads to fewer bidders per auction listed. In the presence of a fixed listing fee, this lowers the expected return from listing an item. Therefore, an increase in the number of sellers leads to a decrease in the expected number of items listed by each seller. One implication of this is that the auction house can manage this decrease in items listed per seller by lowering per item fees.</p><p>Likewise, the number of active buyers and their respective valuations affect the seller's listing decision. The expected return in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">12</ref>) is a function of the second highest bid, as noted in Equation (10). The second highest bid is, in turn, a function of the number of bidders J and their bidding thresholds x * as indicated in Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>). As more bidders become active (i.e., x * decreases-which could occur if the mean of the valuation distribution increases) or the universe of bidders becomes larger (J increasesfor example, the bidding population become larger), the seller return increases and more sellers will list. In sum, the number of items listed affects buyer participation and the buyer participation affects the number of items listed. Hence, there is a structural link between seller and bidder behaviors.</p><p>Seller Acquisition Cost, C s it . Given the foregoing concavity assumption, we specify the prior distribution of seller i's acquisition cost to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">C s it = C s 0i BOOKVAL C s 1 it q C s 2 it + e Cs q it (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>We include a seller-specific constant term,  We adopt the following hierarchical structure for the heterogenous constant term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">C s 0i ∼ N ¯ C s 0 C s −1 ¯ C s 0 ∼ N = C s 0 2 0C s C s ∼ Gamma a C s 0 b C s 0 (15)</formula><p>Similar to the bidder cost, multiple observations of sellers across auctions enable the identification of seller cost from valuation distribution (which is an important component determining seller revenues).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref> reports the parameter estimates for the auctions model using the Celtic coin data. The table indicates that book value and seller feedback have a positive effect on bidder valuations. For each $1.00 increase in book value, on average, bidders value the item an additional 90 cents. A $1.00 increase in the minimum bid implies an 18-cent increase in bidder value, and this may reflect the belief that a minimum bid is a signal of quality. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ariely and Simonson (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Reiley (2006)</ref>, we find a positive correlation between minimum price and auction price; for each dollar increase in the seller's minimum price, the bidder value increases $0 18. There is no significant effect of a secret reserve on bidder valuations after controlling for the minimum bid. This null result may arise from the sellers' infrequent use of this feature (in just over 2% of auctions) or because the presence of the secret reserve is not as informative as its level (which is not observed). Storefronts add 76 cents to the mean valuation of an item. The presence of a gallery leads to an increase in value of 54 cents, and the presence of a subtitle increases average value by 56 cents. The fee charged to a seller for the gallery is 25 cents, and the fee for the subtitle is 50 cents; both fees lie within the posterior 95% predictive interval, suggesting that the pricing of these features is in line with the additional value they generate. In sum, item-specific, seller-specific characteristics of the auction and marketing all have material effects on bidders' perceived valuations of the goods. The number of auctions attended increases one's bidding disutility, suggesting decreasing marginal returns for auctions. Meanwhile, consistent with an intertemporal budget constraint, we find that a bidder's likelihood of attending new auctions decreases if he or she has won recently (or, alternatively, there are decreasing marginal returns for acquiring an additional item). A significant positive constant cost exists. The constant implies a fixed bidding disutility in the neighborhood of $5.37. Because we use a log-log specification for bidder disutility, the parameters for AttendedAuction and Lapse can be interpreted as elasticities or sensitivities. Hence, the bidding disutility elasticities for concurrent auctions attended and lapse of time are around 0.79 and −0.31, respectively.</p><p>Acquisition opportunity costs for a seller increase with an item's book value. In particular, given the loglog specification, one can interpret the parameters as elasticities. For a 1% increase in the book value, there is an impact on the seller's total cost of 0 86%. Furthermore, the elasticity of seller cost for the number of listings is 1 27. The mean of the seller-specific constant term is 1 05. Because the constant term serves as a scaling factor in our formulation of seller costs, the finding that this term is close to 1 suggests the scaling effect is immaterial. In other words, seller acquisition costs are largely determined by per item costs and the opportunity cost for multiple listings.</p><p>To illustrate the fit of our model, we simulate bid values within sample based on our estimates and data. We then compare the observed bid/book ratios with the simulated ratios. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the comparison between the two variable distributions. The model fits the mean bid-to-book ratio very well (observed = 0 48; simulated = 0 48). The median is also comparable (0 31 vs. 0 39). Overall, the fit seems good, suggesting our model specification captures the observed bidding behaviors well.</p><p>Of note, we contrast the full model to one wherein we model only bidder behavior. The bidder-model parameter estimates are virtually identical to those obtained using the full model, though the full model yields better predictions about bidder behavior, potentially suggesting gains in efficiency arising from joint estimation (the log-marginal likelihood for  bidders in the joint model is −20,062.5 vs. −20,265.2 in the buyer-only model). We speculate that the similarity in bidder parameter estimates across the bidderonly and bidder-seller models reflects independence in errors across the bidder and lister models; this finding would be less likely in the face of omitted variables that could induce correlated errors. Though our results indicate that joint estimation is more likely an issue of efficiency than bias, it is important to note that estimates on seller behavior are requisite for engaging the policy simulations that underpin the goals of this paper. Hence our research could not proceed without the seller model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Managerial Implications</head><p>Whereas the parameter estimates are informative about bidder and seller behavior, they offer little explicit guidance to the auction house about its marketing strategy. We consider three strategic implications: a manipulation of auction house fees (which is informative about optimal pricing), the attrition of a customer (which is informative about customer value), and the effect of seller characteristics on auction house revenues (which places a value on a seller's reputational capital).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Pricing Elasticity and Optimal Pricing.</head><p>Using the model estimates, one can assess the effect of the auction house pricing strategy on the market equilibrium number of listings, bids, and closing prices in the considered category. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> As noted above, we can infer the price-demand relationship even in the absence of any historic variation in fees because the structural model is informative about the latent bidder and seller costs and the bidder valuations. The price-demand relationship enables us to infer how a change in auction house fees affects seller profits and hence the seller listings and the resulting bidder demand. With information on the number and closing price of auctions, the auction house can assess how a fee change affects its revenue (which is equal to the 18 Note that our model assumes that buyers and sellers behave optimally, but our simulation presumes the auction house does not. Prima facie, this seems inconsistent. However, there are some differences between these parties. First and foremost, the firm has indicated directly to us that its pricing does not follow an elasticitybased approach but that it is more heuristic based. Hence it is interested in using elasticity-based pricing to inform its decisions, which is a key goal of this exercise. Second, buyers and sellers face repeated observations and play auctions over many occasions. This suggests the potential for learning and feedback, as such, the "as if" optimality assumption may be reasonable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amaldoss and Jain 2005)</ref>. In contrast, little price variation exists for the auction house, making it difficult to learn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 7</head><p>Fee and Commission Price Elasticities total merchandise volume in the market times the percent commission plus the total number of listed items times the listing fee per item). In Table <ref type="table">7</ref> we compute auction fee price elasticities by simulating the effect of a 1% decrease in current listing fees and commissions on profits. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Table <ref type="table">7</ref> indicates that a decrease in fees improves seller profits, leading to more listings and more gross volume sold on the site. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> However, the effect is much larger for commissions than for listing fees. As a result, the overall increase in volume at the auction site arising from a commission decrease generates enough total revenue to offset the reduction in per item commissions. In contrast, the increased volume arising from reduced per item listing fees does not offset the loss in the per item listing fee. All 95% posterior predictive intervals for these fee elasticities exclude zero. Accordingly, we would recommend that the auction house shifts its fees for this category from commissions to listing fees by reducing the commissions and increasing the listing fees. At a minimum, we would recommend that it refrain from raising commissions further by raising listing fees instead.</p><p>This recommendation can be explained in part by noting how different fee types affect sellers. Per item fees are an example of a uniform pricing strategy, whereas commissions tend to disproportionately affect higher-value items. As a result, a decrease in commissions disproportionately affects high-value sellers relative to a decrease in fees. Simulating the effect of a two-point decrease in commissions, we observe more high book value items listed and high feedback sellers listing more items relative to the case wherein per item fees are decreased. As higher book values and reputations lead to increased item valuations, a reduction in commissions disproportionately affects these groups, thereby leading to an increase in high-valuation listings. Given that these highvaluation items generate higher profits for the seller, a small reduction in commissions can lead to a considerable increase in seller profits for such items and a concurrent increase in listings. We note that these effects are likely to be amplified in categories wherein valuations and feedback scores assume greater importance, such as art. To further assess the degree to which listing fees should be increased and commissions reduced for the considered category, we create a 9 × 6 grid of alternative commission and listing fee structures and estimate the house revenues associated with each fee combination. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> reports the result of this analysis.</p><p>The upper left corner of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> reflects the current level of listing fees and commissions. Each subsequent row indicates the effect of a one-quarter point decrease in commissions. Thus, the last row indicates a two-point decrease in commissions. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Each subsequent column from left to right indicates the effect of a 5% increase in the listing fee. Thus, the last column indicates a 25% increase in listing fees from the current level. The cells in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> report the percentage change in auction house revenue for each combination of commission and listing fees; in general, revenues increase with lower commissions and higher fees. The maximum revenue increase of roughly 3% is associated with a 0.75-point reduction in commissions and a 15% increase in listing fees. Even if the auction house did not decrease commissions, it is possible to increase revenues by nearly 1% with a 15% increase in listing fees. To the extent that similar increases could be realized across categories, a 3% increase could prove quite considerable.</p><p>6.1.2. Price Customization. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang and Wedel (2007)</ref> proposed that pricing customization across customers enhances profits in the context of frequently purchased grocery goods. We therefore seek to assess whether the result is similar in the context of auctions. One reason that customization may be efficacious is the relatively high dispersion in the value of items listed for sale in the auction context (book values range from $3 to $675). Sellers of highvalue listings (defined as those items with greater value than the median book value) stand to gain more from changes to commissions, whereas sellers of lowvalue items stand to gain more from changes in per item listing fees. To explore whether we can improve on the pricing strategies in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref>, we proceed as follows. Instead of increasing fees and lowering commissions to all sellers, we increase fees and lower commissions only for high-value sellers. Given that sellers of high-value items are more sensitive to commissions and less sensitive to fees, targeting a price change to these sellers could prove profitable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref> reports this analysis.</p><p>Comparing the first columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> with those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref>, we observe that a 0.75-point decrease in commissions (and no change in per item fees) targeted to only the high-item-value sellers yields a nearly 3.0% revenue increase in a customized setting but only a 1.2% increase in the uniform-pricing setting. Not only does this triple the revenue gain observed in the nontargeted pricing setting, it exceeds the maximum potential return of 2.89% when prices are not customized. Therefore, targeting commissions seems to have a material effect on revenues. Contrasting the first rows of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref> to those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref> yields a comparison between raising per item listing fees to all sellers and only raising fees to high-value sellers (as low-value sellers are presumably more sensitive to fees). As the cells are comparable across the two tables, we conclude that there is little benefit to targeting fees relative to targeting commissions. Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref> suggests the maximum return of the proposed customized strategy (obtained with a 0.75-point decrease in commission and a 15% increase in fee to high-value sellers) is 3.91%, compared with 2.89% from the blanket strategy. Thus, the potential gain from targeted pricing is about 35%. These numbers are in line with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang and Wedel (2007)</ref>.</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science 27(5), pp. 861-885, © 2008 INFORMS</ref> In sum, the joint model of bidder and seller behavior enables us to develop pricing prescriptions even in the absence of any historical pricing variation. Given the total volume transacted in the area of Internet auctions, the pricing problem is important, and the proposed model represents an initial step toward addressing it. In principle, other policy simulations are possible with our model, including an assessment of how a change in auction rules away from sealedbid second-price auctions would affect auction house revenue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Customer Value in a Two-Sided Market</head><p>Valuing customers has seen increased research attention in marketing in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kamakura et al. 2005)</ref>. Firms seek to assess customer profitability to determine (a) how much to invest in a given customer (for retention or acquisition) and (b) whether to divest an unprofitable customer, and for firm valuation. Yet the customer-valuation literature focuses on customer valuation in contexts where one customer's presence does not affect another's. Valuing customers in two-sided markets is problematic because of the interaction between bidders and sellers. Exacerbating this consideration in the context of auctions is the role of competition in customer valuation. If a seller attrites, the supply of auctions decreases. Given that price increases are permanent, this has two enduring effects: (a) fewer items listed leads to increased competition on the part of bidders for the remaining items, thereby driving up prices, resulting in higher per auction commissions for the auction house, and (b) higher prices paid by buyers and less competition encourages the remaining sellers to list some additional items, which will also generate revenue for the auction house. These factors, which we denote indirect value effects, will offset the initial revenue lost from a departing seller (denoted direct value effects), and these indirect effects could be considerable.</p><p>A similar categorization applies on the bidder side. When one buyer departs the system, others that remain will bid for the items, thereby offsetting this loss to some degree. However, softer competition among bidders could also lead to lower prices and therefore fewer items listed on the part of sellers. Thus, the direct value effect for a buyer in terms of auction revenue is offset to some degree by the presence of other bidders in the system, provided this does not induce too many sellers to depart.</p><p>In the absence of a model that captures competitive interactions, it is unclear how to value customers. The most commonly used practice is to use the direct effect to measure customer value. However, this approach overstates the value of a customer by ignoring competition. Our solution to this problem is to conduct a policy experiment wherein a particular buyer or seller is excluded from the system and to compute the change in the equilibrium number of listings and closing prices of those listings over the duration of the data. By comparing the new equilibrium to the original, we can compute the short-term value of a customer to the auction house. In doing so, we abstract away from long-term dynamics such as the growth (diffusion) of bidders and sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gupta et al. 2006)</ref>. It is therefore important to delineate between our short-term measure of customer value (as in our approach) and the more forward-looking lifetime value metrics often used in marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gupta et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Kamakura et al. 2005</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">10</ref> reports the result of a simulation wherein the largest buyer and seller attrite and shows the resulting loss in fees to the auction house.</p><p>The first row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">10</ref> presents the direct value effects or the revenue of the auctions in which the customer participates, reflecting the total fees arising from the auctions in which the largest seller and buyer transact (a commonly used metric for valuing a customer in a two-sided market). The third row reports the equilibrium revenue realized by the auction house when the customer attrites as computed by our model (we call this the total effect, as it is the sum of the direct effect plus the indirect and opposite effect arising from competition). The second row reports the difference between the direct effect and the total effect (i.e., the indirect effect). We also compute the relative percentage of the total effect that arises from the direct and indirect effects. For example, the direct effect of the largest seller on auction house revenues is $127. The revenue realized by the auction house if this seller were to attrite is $97 (the total effect). Thus, the direct effects overstate the total revenue loss by $30, or nearly a third ($30/$97). Given that competition does not offset most of the loss, we conclude that products sold by this vendor in this market are not altogether highly substitutable with the other products being auctioned. A rather different conclusion is realized on the buyer side, where the largest buyer generates $26 in direct revenue but only $5 in total revenue, suggesting that the indirect effects are $21. When this buyer leaves the market, others fill the void. Accordingly, the direct effects overstate the total effect by more than 400%.</p><p>As noted above, indirect effects manifest as changes in equilibrium prices and supply. We can apportion the indirect effects across prices and supply to ascertain which effect is greater. This decomposition yields insights into whether the largest customer is more likely to affect listings (driven by seller behavior) or the closing price per listing (driven by bidder behavior). Let N 0 denote the number of closing auctions listed by competing sellers prior to attrition of the largest seller and p 0 denote the N 0 * 1 vector of unit revenues (commission plus listing fees) of those auctions. Similarly, we denote the number of auctions and vector of unit revenues after the largest seller attrites as N s and p s . Using this notation, we compute (a) the indirect effects arising solely from a change in unit revenues holding the number of auctions fixed, k=1 p 0k . We use a similar decomposition to assess the effect of buyer attrition. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">11</ref> presents the results of this analysis.</p><p>Columns 2 and 3 report the results for the attrition of the largest seller, and columns 4 and 5 report the analogous results for the attrition of the largest buyer. Of the $30 indirect competitive effects that offset the total effect of the largest seller's attrition, about two-fifths ($12) of the competitive effects is due to other sellers listing more items and about three-fifths ($18) of the competitive effect is due to higher prices that arise from bidders bidding on fewer goods. Thus, seller attrition plays a major role on both competitor behavior (items listed) and bidder behavior (bids).</p><p>With regard to the departure of the largest buyer, about two-fifths ($9) of the indirect effects can be attributed to the unit revenue change and three-fifths ($12) can be accounted for by changes in the number of auctions. Although the biggest bidder attrites, other bidders step in to fill the void and generate $21 to largely offset the $26 loss. Overall, we conclude that, under a two-sided market such as online auctions, using direct revenue as the metric may overstate a customer's value considerably. To accurately measure the value of a customer, a firm needs to take into account the network externalities caused by the customer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Elasticities of Seller Feedback Scores</head><p>As noted in the literature on signalling game, seller feedback should play a role in transmitting the quality of a product, leading to increased bids <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cabral and Hortacsu 2006)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref> confirms this proposition, suggesting that an increase of 100 in the seller feedback score leads to an average increase in customer valuation of 3 cents. However, the magnitude of the feedback elasticity is unclear because a change in its value (holding other sellers' feedback scores fixed) will induce other sellers to change their listing behaviors, which in turn has a downstream influence on bidders. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">12</ref> we report the effect of a 1% increase in seller feedback scores on the seller's and auction house's revenues. We find that a 1% increase in reputation leads to a 0.15% increase in seller profits, assuming no competitive reaction in reputation. Using our estimates of cost, we can compute the break-even value for increasing reputational capital. As our model estimates suggest that costs are roughly half of seller revenues, this calculation implies that if the cost of increasing reputation by 1% is less than 0.30% of revenue, then it is profitable to do so. In practice, the 0.30% threshold is an upper bound because it is reasonable to conjecture that competing sellers will also raise their reputation scores in response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Internet auctions have grown exponentially over the past decade and are now a major worldwide source of transactional volume. In spite of this ascendancy, few econometric models exist to explain the role of seller behavior in the context of auctions. Seller behaviors are of interest because (a) they affect the optimal policy on the part of the auction house (such as the fee structure and auction design), (b) seller behaviors affect the choices of bidders, which suggests that the traditional assumption of exogenous seller behavior in the empirical industrial organization (IO) literature may be questionable, and (c) seller behavior is of interest in its own right (in assessing customer value, for example).</p><p>We redress this consideration via a structural model of seller and bidder behaviors across auctions. We posit that sellers will list if the return from doing so exceeds their respective costs. Likewise, we presume the bidders will bid if the expected return from doing so exceeds their respective costs. An important component of the model is its integration of bidder and seller behavior. Sellers, when deciding to list, must consider the bids likely to materialize and the potential of competitive listings. Likewise, bidders must consider the number of auctions across which they can bid. In this fashion, the behaviors of the two groups are linked. This linkage exemplifies a two-sided market wherein bidders and sellers interact on a common platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rochet and Tirole 2006)</ref> and extends structural models of auctions into this domain.</p><p>Accordingly, we develop an empirical structural model that rationalizes bidder and seller behavior under the auction context. We estimate this model using six months of auction data for Celtic coins provided by an auction house. The data are consistent with an independent PV auction. We use MCMC techniques to estimate the costs and valuations that would be consistent with the bidding and listing behavior observed in the data. Once these are known, it becomes possible to assess the role of fees on equilibrium listings. That is, as fees rise, seller profits fall and sellers are less likely to list. Bidders, faced with fewer auctions, will increase their bids to win. The net effect can be determined in this fashion.</p><p>The estimates from our empirical model indicate that item characteristics (such as its book value), seller characteristics (feedback scores), and marketing tools (minimum bid, the use of a store front, and additional item information revealed by a subtitle and a picture) have significant impacts on bidder valuations and thus on their bids. We further develop insights into bidder and seller costs and valuations, such as the finding that a 1% increase in book value on average increases seller costs by 0.86%.</p><p>Using these results, our policy experiment indicates that an increase in listing fees will increase auction house revenues, while an increase in commissions will decrease them. By searching over a grid of values in the neighborhood of its current fees, we find that the change in fees and commissions can bring an increase of nearly 3% in auction house revenues for the Celtic coin category. The intuition behind this result is that fees exemplify a uniform pricing policy, whereas commissions are a form of high-value pricing discrimination. As such, a decrease in commissions has a large effect on the profitability of highvaluation items (such as those with a high book value and those listed by high-reputation sellers), leading to a large increase in listings for such items. Accordingly, we expect our finding that pricing should be reallocated toward fixed fees to be amplified in categories with more high-valuations items and attenuated in categories with lower-valuation items. We build further on this intuition by considering a targeted pricing strategy wherein high-value users face lower commissions and higher per item fees than low-value users. We find that customized pricing can increase revenues by 35% over the uniform pricing solution.</p><p>The approach developed here is also useful for assessing short-term customer value in two-sided markets. Customer value is relevant to firms seeking to assess how much to invest in retaining or acquiring customers; to date, this literature has been silent on the value of customers in the context of two-sided markets. The primary information available to value a customer (such as a seller) is the revenue that customer generates for a firm. However, such a valuation fails to account for competitive effects such as the tendency of bidders to switch to other sellers when a seller attrites and the tendency of other sellers to list more items. In general, we find approaches that ignore such indirect effects to overstate customer value of the seller by nearly a third and the value of a buyer by more than 400%. We further apportion these indirect seller effects into an increase in the number of listings by competing sellers who seek to capitalize on the departure of competition and the increase in prices arising from stiffer bidder competition for the remaining items. We find these effects to be roughly equal.</p><p>The complexity of the problem we consider necessitates some simplifications, which also represent both limits and future research opportunities. In particular, we approximate bidding dynamics using lagged purchases in the cost function to capture intertemporal dynamics and multiauction bidding that may be induced by an intertemporal multi-item budget constraint or price expectations. A more complete specification of the dynamics might yield some novel insights. Further research is therefore warranted.</p><p>Second, consistent with our data, our model uses the PV assumption to simplify the analysis. An extension to the CV setting would yield interesting insights about interactions among bidders. Third, we do not consider competition between auction houses. We believe this is a reasonable approach, as fees constitute a relatively small component of the overall cost of listing items in this category and because the large number of bidders and sellers on this site makes it less likely that competing sites would be attractive alternatives to sellers. Nonetheless, intersite competition is widely unaddressed in the literature and represents an important direction for future analysis. Fourth, we presume the auction house is not strategic in its price-setting behavior. Though this assumption is predicated on conversations with price setters at this organization, many firms (e.g., Google and Yahoo!) are strategic in their use of pricing mechanisms and it would be interesting to address this issue. Fifth, we consider listing features to be exogenous. It is unlikely that endogenizing these variables will yield a unique equilibrium, so it is unclear whether relaxing this restriction will be useful for policy analysis. Moreover, given the number of potential combinations of these features, it is not clear that it is possible to solve for all of them. Yet these features represent a source of revenue to the auction house, and the problem of how to price these is another area of importance to consider; recent advances in combinatorial optimization could prove fruitful here.</p><p>In sum, we believe that the combination of the material economic importance of auctions and the large array of remaining problems for consideration suggests this is a rich area for future research. We hope our initial foray into the problem of bidder and seller networks in the context of auctions will lead to further research in this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A1. Proof of Theorem 1</head><p>In a second-price sealed-bid auction with IPVs, the optimal equilibrium bidding strategy is for participants to bid their respective valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Milgrom and Weber 1982)</ref>. Thus, the second highest bid and the price paid by the winner to the seller is equivalent to the second highest valuation of participants (or the seller-chosen minimum bid if the second highest bid is below the seller minimum). Accordingly, the winning bidder receives a return equal to his or her valuation less the price paid to the seller (i.e., the second highest bid or the minimum bid, whichever is greater) and less the bidder's latent cost of participating in the auction. Losing bidders receive no surplus and pay only their latent costs of participation. Bidder j's expected return for participating in an auction is therefore given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">E ijtn = v ijtn − v ijtn −max j MinBid it f j d j −C b ijtn (A.1)</formula><p>where j is the highest rival's bid and f j is its density. The first term represents the expected revenue accruing to bidder j from participating in the auction, the second term is the expected payment to the seller, and the third term is the bidding cost. Note that when j &gt; v ijtn , bidder j loses the auction, receives no revenue, and makes no payment to the seller. Hence the integral of j in Equation (A.1) has an upper limit of v ijtn . Bidder j will participate in the auction if and only if E ijtn ≥ 0.</p><p>We claim that E ijtn is increasing in v ijtn . This insight is necessary to establish the existence of a minimum bidding threshold below which a bidder will not participate in an auction and above which it becomes always profitable to do so.

This implies that there exists a bidding threshold x * ijtn such that bidder j will enter the auction for any v ijtn ≥ x * ijtn where x * ijtn is the root of E ijtn • = 0.

The integral over C b ij tn arises from bidder j's uncertainty about other bidders' costs. Furthermore, for j to be the highest rival bid among the J − 1 bidders, the remaining J − 2 bidders (other than bidder j and the bidder with value j ) must have values (a) greater than their respective bidding thresholds x * ij tn but lower than j , (b) less than their respective bidding thresholds but higher than j , or (c) less than their respective bidding thresholds but lower than j . Condition (a) gives the first row in the set of braces; condition (b) and (c) together give the second <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Note that the formula for the derivative with respect to the upper bound of an integral is </p><formula xml:id="formula_37">C b ij tn G j it − G x * ij tn it F x * j + G x * ij tn it f C b ij tn dC b ij tn J −2</formula><p>where F x * • is the distribution of x * • .

Hence we approximate this distribution by using the sample population distribution of x * ijtn . This distribution can be obtained by first making draws from the distribution of C b ijtn , then computing x * ijtn C b ijtn . The integral over C b ij tn again arises from bidder j's uncertainty about other bidders' costs.

This is mainly because the bidder calculates a first-order statistic while the seller considers a second-order statistic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A2. Proof of Theorem 2</head><p>The second highest bid has the distribution density</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">C b ijtn g it ≥ x * f C b ijtn dC b ijtn , i.e.</formula><p>, the bidder has a draw from the valuation distribution g</p><p>• and the draw is higher than the bidding threshold x * . The integral over C b ijtn is from the assumption that the seller only has knowledge of the distribution of bidders' disutilities but is uncertain about the exact costs for each bidder. Therefore, the seller forms expectations about x * by integrating over C b ijtn . Furthermore, for to be the second highest bid, the following two constraints must be satisfied:</p><p>1. Among the J bidders, in addition to the top two highest bidders (the winning bid and the second highest bid,</p><p>), there remain J − 2 competitive bidders whose valuations are either (a) higher than their bidding thresholds, x *</p><p>• , but lower than , or (b) below their bidding thresholds, x *</p><p>• . 2.

Because x * ijtn is defined by an implicit function, it is difficult to write this distribution in closed form. Hence we approximate this distribution by using the sample population distribution of x * ijtn . This distribution can be obtained by first making draws from the distribution of C b ijtn , then computing x * ijtn C b ijtn . Note that the two terms essentially "break up" the value distribution into (a) those values that lie between and x *</p><p>• and (b) those values that lie between x *</p><p>• and the lower bound of the value distribution.</p><p>The second constraint leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">1 − C b ijtn G it − G x * ijtn it F x * + G x * ijtn it f C b ijtn dC b ijtn i.e</formula><p>., the complement of events represented by terms in the braces of Equation (A.5). This becomes the second set of braces in Theorem 2. Again, the integrals in both constraints are from the randomness of C b ijtn . Furthermore, since any of the J bidders can be the second highest bidder, we need to multiply the result by J 1 = J . Similarly, any of the J − 1 bidders (other than the second highest one) can be the highest bidder; we also need to multiply the result by</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">J −1 1 = J − 1.</formula></div>

Priors</head><p>We run the sampling chain for 20,000 iterations; the first 10,000 iterations are used for burn-in and the remaining 10,000 are used for sampling.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">As discussed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Laffont and Vuong (1996)</ref>, auction data are well suited for structural models as auctions are asymmetric information games and the data-generating process is strategy driven. For a more complete summary of structural models of auctions, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reiss and Wolak (2005)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2"><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bajari and Hortacsu (2003)</ref> assume an opportunity cost for bidders such that all bidders' entry decisions satisfy a "zero profit condition." That is, no bidder obtains positive expected utility for attending auctions. Given the estimates of the model, the distribution of the cost is simulated based on the zero profit condition and the model estimates. In our context we observe bidders' bidding histories across multiple auctions, which enables us to explicitly estimate heterogenous bidding disutilities across bidders.3  Bajari and Hortacsu (2003) is a notable exception.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">By short term, we refer to the value of the customer over the duration of our data. Long-term, or life-time, value would consider the infinite horizon value of a customer.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">This number reflects the exclusion of 36 largely inactive sellers, who only listed one auction in the six-month period. The sparse observation per seller makes it difficult to make inferences about their behavior and identify seller-specific effects (that said, our key results are robust to their inclusion). By omitting these 36 sellers/auctions, we also lose 10 bidders (out of a pool of 935 bidders) who bid only in those auctions.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">Marketing Science 27(5), pp.861-885, © 2008 INFORMS   </note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">The seller market is moderately concentrated with a Herfindahl Index of 0.12. The top 15 sellers account for 80% of all listings.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">In CV settings, winning bidders are those most likely to have overestimated an item's value (which is the reason for their highest bids). Note that all bidders have the same ex post valuation. Thus, winning bidders typically overpay, hence the "winner's curse." The bidder will lower his or her bid to offset this potential overestimation.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">The assumption that bidders and sellers know the full bidder cost distribution results in a log marginal likelihood of −21,278.4. Restricting this knowledge to only the the mean of this distribution yields a log marginal likelihood of −21,469.9. Hence the data support the assumption that bidders and sellers are aware of the bidder cost distribution.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">We also considered a lognormal distribution for v to ensure all valuations are positive; however, this led to a considerable decrease in model fit(−21,278.4 vs. −23,305.8). The negative values implied by the normal distribution may be justified by the explanation that some bidders do value the item negatively. A similar specification is used in<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bajari and Hortacsu (2003)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">We also considered a specification wherein the variance of the bidder valuation distribution was a function of item, seller, and marketing charactersitics; that is, it = Z it . However, this model did not improve fit, nor were any of the variables significant (the log marginal likelihood of the alternative specification is −21,355.7).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="14">Although the seller can still choose to sell the item if the realized final price is lower than the secret reserve, we assume that the seller assigns zero probability to such an event when calculating ex ante expected return.15  We also estimated a model wherein the minimum price decision is endogenous. The endogenous minimum price model yields a lower log marginal likelihood for the listing decision and bids (−21,278.41 vs. −22,150.82).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="16">Under the assumption that listing features are exogenous, a unique equilibrium is assured with a quasiconcave revenue function and a convex cost function.17  Given that commissions are tiered in our data, we compute commissions incumbent on the auction's closing price. However, to facilitate exposition, we omit tier-specific commission subscripts throughout the paper.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="19">The auction house uses a tiered commission system. To protect the confidentiality of the data supplier, we do not reveal the actual commissions. To compute the elasticities, we decrease the commission at each level by 1%. Likewise, we reduce the listing fees by 1%.20  We do not report actual revenues to protect the confidentiality of the data provider. However, the actual revenue lies within the 95% posterior predictive interval for estimated revenues.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="21">We base the two-point decrease on the highest commission rate (which is associated with the lowest tier of closing prices). We then translate this point decrease to a percentage and apply it to the other pricing tiers.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">When there is a secret reserve price, sellers themselves can be considered as additional "bidders."</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="24">Note that a seller makes decision in Stage 1 before the bidder's decisions. The seller takes the bidder cost distribution into account when he calculates the expected return. Thus L seller also appears in the conditional likelihood of C b ijtn .</note>

The simulated data have 10 sellers and 100 bidders. Each seller has two to four items for sale and makes decisions about the optimal number of auctions for each item. The sellers' optimization results in a total of 213 auctions in the market. Each bidder then makes decisions about bidding activities.
