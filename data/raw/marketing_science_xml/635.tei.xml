<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>P rices for goods such as blades for razors, ink for printers, and concessions at movies are often set well above cost. Theory has shown that this could yield a profitable price discrimination strategy often termed "metering." The idea is that a customer's intensity of demand for aftermarket goods (e.g., the concessions) provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to pay for the primary good (e.g., admission). If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price (admissions plus concessions) from higher-type customers. This paper develops a simple aggregate model of discrete-continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data. Model simulations illustrate that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below, or equal to their marginal cost. We then apply the approach to box office and concession data from a chain of Spanish theaters and find that high-priced concessions do extract more surplus from customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When a variable unit good is sold after the purchase of a single unit good, the price of the variable unit good is often observed to be well above cost. For instance, popcorn purchased after entering a movie theater, sports stadium, or other venue charging admission is priced much higher than in grocery stores, small shops, or restaurants. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A common presumption is that the venues exploit the fact that customers have little if any choice between sellers of the aftermarket good (i.e., the concessions). Although this presumption is probably accurate, it is important to recognize that high aftermarket prices might reflect a shift in profits to aftermarket goods to extract more surplus from the customers that buy more of them. This strategy has been termed metering price discrimination because the surplus extracted from a customer is "metered" by how much of the aftermarket good they demand. It is an attractive price discrimination scheme because it falls within the category of seconddegree price discrimination such that the firm does not need to identify specific customers or groups of 1 Sources used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gil and Hartmann (2007)</ref> indicate that costs of nonadmission items amount to only 15% of the revenue that they produce. customers to offer tailored menus of prices. Among all second-degree price discrimination schemes, this is also one of the simplest to implement because the firm only needs to set two prices.</p><p>Like other forms of price discrimination, metering has the ability to increase efficiency because it can open access of a good to customers that would otherwise be priced out of the market. For example, if a venue priced concessions at or near marginal cost, its admission price would likely be set higher and some customers would be left out. Therefore, although the surplus of some consumers may be reduced by high concession prices, total surplus, producer surplus, and the surplus of other consumers may be increased. 2 2 One condition under which total surplus could decrease even though movie admission increases is if the reduced concession sales from high concession prices reduces surplus more than the surplus increase for admission. We doubt this is possible in this case and many other similar examples because the aftermarket goods (concessions) are of substantively less consequence than the primary good (movie admission). Specifically, concessions could be purchased without ever attending a movie, so it seems reasonable to weight the surplus effects of the movies much greater than those of the concessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gil and Hartmann: Empirical Analysis of Metering Price Discrimination</head><p>Marketing Science 28(6), pp. <ref type="bibr">1046</ref><ref type="bibr">-1062</ref> 1047 For high aftermarket prices to be associated with efficiency increases, the primary good price must be predicted to be lower than it would be under a competitive aftermarket. However, primary good prices are only lower because of metering if customers that demand more aftermarket goods (e.g., concessions) also place a greater value on the primary good (e.g., admission). This demand condition has been shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oi (1971)</ref>, further explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schmalensee (1981)</ref>, and applied to the case of admission tickets and concessions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ellison (2005)</ref> contrasts the case of metering with add-on pricing. He explicitly uses the example of concessions in movie theaters as one where consumers are fully informed of ticket and popcorn prices, implicitly allowing firms to use metering to price discriminate among customers. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The explanation of metering has been applied to many goods such as razors and blades or Polaroid cameras and film among others, 4 and has been a common efficiency rationale for the decision to tie aftermarket goods to the purchase of primary goods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Peltzman 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Klein 1996</ref>.</p><p>Despite the awareness of metering and its demand conditions, there has yet to be any work estimating whether these demand conditions are met and therefore testing whether metering price discrimination occurs in practice. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> This paper fills this void by developing a simple test that can be applied to market-level data where customers repeatedly buy the primary and aftermarket goods. The intuition for our approach is that increases in primary good demand typically involve more low willingness-topay customers, such that decreases (increases) in aftermarket demand per buyer would indicate a positive (negative) correlation between aftermarket demand and willingness to pay for the primary good. The test therefore involves evaluating whether <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ellison (2005)</ref> focuses on showing that in the presence of add-on pricing, firms may have an incentive to raise prices on the primary good to screen consumers with high valuation for a secondary good. This strategy would only apply to concessions in movie theaters if moviegoers had no information on prices for popcorn. He rules out add-on pricing for the particular case of concession pricing in movie theaters. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Other examples of items where metering may be applied is consoles and video games, rental cars and per-mile charges, or amusement park tickets and per-ride charges. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The closest empirical papers are the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hartmann and Nair (2009)</ref> empirically analyze the pricing of razors and blades. Although they note that metering is a likely explanation for manufacturer pricing in that industry, they focus on the retailers' pricing incentive, where the blades are not tied so as to allow metering. Two papers from the sports economics industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Marburger 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Fort 2004</ref>) consider that concession sales might explain inelastic ticket pricing, but neither paper actually analyzes data on concession sales.</p><p>percentage changes in aftermarket demand or revenue are less than, greater than, or equal to percentage changes in primary demand. For illustration purposes, we define a model and simulate data assuming different demand relationships and find that log aftermarket revenue on log primary demand regressions predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below, or equal to marginal cost.</p><p>Next, we apply our approach to aggregate weekly data from a chain of Spanish movie theaters and find that concession demand does meter willingness to pay for admission. This has two positive implications. First, the finding validates that demand conditions do support metering in one of the most commonly cited examples. Second, even if the firm is not aware of metering price discrimination incentives, it is in fact benefiting from metering price discrimination because its high concession prices are extracting a higher total margin from those willing to pay more for admission.</p><p>The managerial implications of this paper are directed to other firms because the observed chain's concession price is already above cost. To other theater chains and venues such as stadiums and arenas, we suggest that these regressions should be run to also validate that they are not incorrectly pricing concessions high relative to cost. There is potentially even more value in applying this approach in industries where there is or has been variation in whether aftermarket prices are above, below, or equal to cost. For example, the airline industry has recently gone through this change, and the hotel industry exhibits substantial variation in Internet and phone call pricing. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> When applying our approach, it is important to control for factors other than the metering demand relationship that could lead to a relationship between percentage changes in aftermarket and primary demand. Some obvious controls can be applied in all contexts, whereas other controls are application specific. Fixed effects are particularly useful. We use them to control for systematic differences across locations and systematic differences across time. We also test for the relationship of interest within each decile of primary good demand. This allows us to remove confounding factors that might be specific to either high or low primary demand observations. For example, in our application, this allows us to account <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 28(6), pp. 1046</ref><ref type="bibr">-1062</ref> for the fact that in very high attendance weeks, the length of concession lines systematically reduces concession sales. We are able to verify that the queuing effect is restricted to the top decile of attendance weeks and can measure its effect on the correlation of interest. In fact, a supplementary variable measuring how actual demand differed from forecasted demand illustrates that the queuing effect only arises in the top decile when unexpectedly high demand overwhelmed staffing that was based on underpredictions of actual attendance. We also control for the composition of movies (e.g., genre) in case there are differences in concession demand across customer groups that prefer particular types of movies. However, we find few of these to be significant because the fixed effects above account for most of the differences. Other applications will have other potential confounds, but we hope that our extensive robustness checks provide a benchmark.</p><p>One valuable aspect of specifying an approach that draws on theory but can be tested with regressions is that we can uncover the correlation of the underlying taste distributions of consumers for primary and aftermarket goods without many of the parametric assumptions required in a structural approach to estimation. Most empirical demand analyses of price discrimination use a structural approach in which a utility function is specified as a function of parameters, and then the population distributions of the parameters are estimated from the data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leslie 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, McManus 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Cohen 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Mortimer 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Hartmann and Viard 2006</ref>. In our case, we motivate our empirical approach with a flexible utility function defined over the two goods. In other words, our estimates hold for various utility functions.</p><p>Our nonstructural approach is related to "reducedform" empirical analyses of price discrimination but is substantively different in emphasis. The disadvantage of a nonstructural approach is that although we can predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below, or equal to marginal cost, we do not have estimates of model parameters that allow us to predict exact pricing levels. This inability to do such counterfactuals is common to other nonstructural approaches that have been used to empirically analyze price discrimination (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shepard 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Miravete and Röller 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Seim and Viard 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Busse and Rysman 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Borzekowski et al. 2009</ref>). However, our work differs from these papers in that most of these relate the incidence of price discrimination to market structure.</p><p>Although the primary goal of the paper is to explore the phenomenon of metering price discrimination, the paper also contributes to a growing empirical literature on the movie industry. Papers in this area have considered a wide array of topics such as the vertical structure of movie exhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gil 2004)</ref>, the location of theaters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Davis 2006)</ref>, release decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Krider and Weinberg 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Elberse and Eliashberg 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Einav 2007</ref>, run-length decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Swami et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ainslie et al. 2005</ref>, financing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goettler and Leslie 2005)</ref>, risk and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(De Vany 2004)</ref>, and post-box office distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mortimer 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mortimer , 2008</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Eliashberg et al. (2006)</ref> provide an excellent summary of the state of current research in this area. The present paper contributes to this broader literature by linking an empirical analysis of concession sales data to the pricing incentives of exhibitors.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the motivation behind our empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 discusses our empirical approach and results, and §5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Motivation for Empirical Analysis</head><p>The existing theoretical work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oi 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Littlechild 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Schmalensee 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Rosen and Rosenfield 1997</ref> is instructive about the joint distribution of demands required for sales of an aftermarket good to profitably meter the variation in willingness to pay for the associated primary good. However, these theoretical models do not provide intuition about how to uncover this joint distribution from available data. In this section, we illustrate how variation in vertical attributes specific to the primary good can uncover the correlation between willingness to pay for the primary good and demand for the aftermarket good.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">General Utility Function</head><p>We define u y z x I to be a utility function over a primary good y, an aftermarket good z, and a composite commodity x. y can only take values one or zero, whereas x and z can take on any nonnegative values. is a mean zero vertical attribute or demand shock to the primary good that is common to all consumers relative to the value of not consuming the primary good.</p><p>is a vector of preference parameters. We assume consumers spend their entire budget or income I on the three goods such that x = I − py − wz, where p and w are the respective prices of the primary and aftermarket goods. We consider a specific example of this utility function and the following analysis in §2.4 below.</p><p>Utility maximization subject to this budget constraint implies a demand function for the aftermarket good of z w . This demand function reveals two assumptions of our model and analysis: Assumption 1. Aftermarket demand is not affected by the price of the primary good p.</p><p>Assumption 2. Aftermarket demand is not affected by changes in the vertical demand shock .</p><p>The first assumption is satisfied by assuming away income effects, as is common in the discrete-choice demand literature. The second assumption requires that changes in primary good quality or outside options do not increase or decrease the marginal utility of the aftermarket good. This arises if and z are separable in the utility function. In practice, this implies, for example, that an idiosyncratic shock to the demand for a flight, hotel, or movie does not affect the meals, pay-per-view movies, or concessions consumed upon entry. We show below that a common quasi-linear utility function satisfies these assumptions. Assumption 1 is common in the theoretical literature on metering price discrimination and is generally considered reasonable for "small ticket" items like admission tickets and concessions. Assumption 2 is specific to our empirical approach. We therefore include an appendix that illustrates and discusses the sensitivity of our analysis to this assumption.</p><p>Given the demand function for the aftermarket good z w , the choice of the primary good is determined by evaluating whether or not there is positive surplus from purchasing the primary good. We define the consumer surplus from purchasing the primary good to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v p w = v 1 p w − v 0 (1)</formula><p>where v 1 and v 0 are, respectively, the indirect utilities of consuming and not consuming the primary good.</p><p>The marginal consumer for a given demand shock is therefore defined by setting the above equation equal to zero. We define * to denote the preference parameters of this marginal consumer of the primary good. The consumers of the primary good are therefore defined to be all such that v p w ≥ v p w * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Demand Conditions for Metering</head><p>Price Discrimination We now consider the demand conditions for metering price discrimination as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref>. They show that firms should charge a premium on aftermarket goods if the aftermarket demand of the marginal consumer is less than the average aftermarket demand of all primary good consumers:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">z w * &lt; E z w v p w ≥ v p w * (2)</formula><p>The only difference between our model and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref> is that their theoretical model only considers a single market such that there is no demand shock . The consideration of observed data with varying aggregate demands for the primary and aftermarket goods requires such a shock. Moreover, it is exactly this shock that will allow us to test for the condition in Equation (2). To motivate our empirical test, it is first important to note that Equation (2) is equivalent to saying that there is a positive correlation between z w and v p w ; i.e., a positive correlation implies that Equation (2) will be satisfied and that Equation (2) cannot hold without a positive correlation. One other useful thing to note is that because is a vertical shock that does not change the ordering of consumers' valuations, Equation (2) also holds if z w and V w are positively correlated, where V w is a time-invariant measure of a consumer's willingness to pay for the primary good. V w is obtained by setting price and the demand shock in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) equal to zero. To see a practical example of how this arises, please refer to the section below when we apply this to a quasi-linear utility function.</p><p>We now graphically illustrate the metering price discrimination intuition. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> plots V w on the horizontal axis and z w on the vertical axis. enter the diagram by shifting the marginal consumer along the horizontal axis. For example, an increase in the quality of the aftermarket good from to increases the region of consumers buying the primary good from the gray shaded area to the gray shaded area plus the region with the diagonal lines. Line A in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> represents a positive correlation between aftermarket demand and willingness to pay for the primary good. For line A, we see that the aftermarket demand of a marginal consumer z w * is clearly less than the average aftermarket demand of all consumers (to the right) that do purchase the primary good. The price discrimination is evident in recognizing that the total margin contributed by the marginal consumer p + w − c • z w * is less than that contributed by higher willingness-to-pay customers However, if line B describes the relationship between aftermarket demand and willingness to pay for the primary good, the marginal consumer would consume exactly the same amount of the aftermarket good as the rest of the consumers, and all consumers would contribute the same margin: p + w − c z w * .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p + w − c z w V w &gt; V w *</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">An Empirical Test for Metering</head><p>Price Discrimination Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> also provides an intuitive way to learn about the correlation from the relationship between total primary good demand Q = i y i and average aftermarket sales</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">z = E z w u y z p w &gt; u y z p w * = z y = Z Q</formula><p>Total demand is increasing as the marginal consumer shifts to the left in the diagram. We also see that as total demand shifts, the average aftermarket demand changes depending on our correlation of interest. For example, if the quality of a primary good increases such that primary demand increases (i.e., a move from to ), line A would indicate that average aftermarket demand for purchasers of the primary good should fall while line B implies that it should remain the same. Therefore, a negative correlation between primary good demand Q and aftermarket demand per buyer of the primary goodz indicates that the demand conditions for metering price discrimination exist and support a premium on the aftermarket good. Alternatively, no correlation between primary good demand and aftermarket demand per buyer rejects the fact that the demand conditions for metering price discrimination are in place. We discuss the implications of a positive correlation in §2.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>3.1. Discussion. We now discuss a few of the valuable aspects of this approach. First, we only need vertical attributes to vary over time to trace out the correlation between willingness to pay for the primary good and demand for the aftermarket good. Second, we can measure the sign of this correlation directly from the joint distribution of demand for the primary good and aftermarket demand per buyer of the primary good. Finally, as a consequence of the last point, we need not observe the vertical attribute. In our application of concession sales at movies, the vertical attribute indexes changes in the quality of the selection of movies at the theater and changes in the consumers' outside options. These variables are generally not observable and there is typically not observed price variation from week to week <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Orbach and Einav 2007)</ref>. Therefore, our approach allows us to test the relationship by only observing the aggregate demands of the two goods. We illustrate in our simulations that our approach also works when prices endogenously vary with .</p><p>One other important issue to consider is the presence of variation in horizontal attributes that may change the selection of consumers arriving across different observations of the aggregate primary and aftermarket good demands. Because our analysis relies on variation in vertical attributes tracing out the relationship between concession demand and willingness to pay, we require that the vertical dimension that drives primary good demand does not have a systematic relationship with the presence of horizontal attributes. The standard assumption in discrete-choice demand models that unobserved product quality is not correlated with other product characteristics would be sufficient. More generally, if horizontal attributes exist in the data, there are two ways to address this. First, horizontal attributes can be controlled for if observed, or if they are common across multiple observations but unobserved, fixed effects can be used. We use both approaches in our empirical application. Second, we can test the relationship of interest throughout multiple regions on the horizontal axis of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. If horizontal attributes lead to different types of consumers systematically arriving at different primary good demand levels, it is likely that they will be concentrated in certain parts of the primary good demand distribution (otherwise, the horizontal attributes would have to be almost perfectly correlated with primary good demand). If so, a misinterpreted correlation would only be found in some regions and researchers would know this is a problem. In our analysis, we find that the same correlation holds throughout 10 deciles representing primary good demand along the horizontal axis in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">An Illustrative Utility Function</head><p>We now consider a quasi-linear utility function that fits within the general model to clarify the utility function discussion and provide a basis for some model simulations. A consumer's utility depends on whether or not the primary good is consumed y ∈ 0 1 and, if consumed, how much of the aftermarket good is consumed z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u y z p w = + + z y + x = + + z y + I − py − wz (3)</formula><p>The consumer's preference parameters, = , are defined as follows. + is the consumer's utility for the primary good. is a consumer's timeinvariant preferences for the primary good, and is the time-varying primary good demand shock that is common to all consumers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Model Simulations to Illustrate</head><p>Correlation Patterns We now illustrate how different distributions of model parameters can lead to positive, zero, or negative correlations in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (i.e., between z w and V w by simulating the variables at hypothetical parameter values. Obviously, there must be some heterogeneity in model parameters or there will only be a mass of consumers at a single point in the diagram. We therefore define the variables to be joint normal or log-normally distributed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">    ln ln     ∼ N         2 0 35 −1 2         2 2 2        </formula><p>is assumed homogenous across consumers at a value of 0.35. We consider three different heterogeneity structures that can drive the correlation to be positive, zero, or negative. First, suppose that there is only heterogeneity in the marginal utility of income. This is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) and gives us the upward sloping relationship resembling line A in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Under these parameters and a constant marginal cost of the aftermarket good equal to 0.4, the optimal aftermarket price is just less than 0.56, i.e., a 39% markup. In other words, the firm is engaging in metering price discrimination. Second, suppose there is only heterogeneity in the tastes for the primary good. This is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b) and gives us the flat line resembling B in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Under these parameters, the optimal aftermarket price is exactly 0.4, implying no markup. This pricing is consistent with a typical two-part tariff in which all surplus is extracted on the primary good. Finally, suppose there is a positive correlation between tastes for the primary good and the marginal utility of income. This is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(c) and gives us a distribution of tastes that are negatively correlated such that the marginal consumers would pay the largest total price despite having the smallest willingness to pay. One way in which this pattern might arise is if consumers with the lowest opportunity costs of time were also the most price-sensitive consumers. Under these parameters, the firm's optimal aftermarket price is 0.37, implying a 6% markdown below cost. Essentially, the firm meters in the opposite direction. Marginal customers would not be willing to buy the primary good at the high primary good price targeted to the high willingness-to-pay customers, so the firm lures them in with aftermarket subsidies that are disproportionately favored by lower willingness-to-pay customers.</p><p>Other forms of heterogeneity could also bring rise to similar plots. For example, a negative correlation between and also leads to a plot similar to that in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Also, if heterogeneity only exists in , a plot similar to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) would arise. Plots similar to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) could also arise if and are positively correlated, if and are negatively correlated, and if all correlations are zero and either or are heterogeneous. Once again, it is useful to point out that only in the case of plots resembling Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) does metering price discrimination favor charging a premium on aftermarket goods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Testing for the Relationships Using</head><p>Log-Log Regressions As we described in §2.3, the relationship of interest can be tested by evaluating the correlation between average aftermarket good demand Z/Q and aggregate primary good demand Q. In other words, one could test this with the following simple regression equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Z/Q = 0 + 1 Q + e (7)</formula><p>For practical purposes, we transform this by taking logs of the variables and actually run the regression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">log Z = d 0 + d 1 log Q + (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>and test whether d 1 is greater than, equal to, or less than one. To illustrate the ability of this simple regression to uncover the relationship of interest, we apply it to the aggregate primary and aftermarket good demands that came from the simulated data in Figures <ref type="figure">2(a</ref>), 2(b), and 2(c). Note that in our application we only observe aftermarket revenue, so we actually substitute wZ in place of Z in the regression.</p><p>We can see in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> that when metering demand conditions supporting an aftermarket premium exist (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) and specification A in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), our regression predicts a coefficient statistically significantly less than one. When demand conditions are such that metering should not exist and a two-part tariff with aftermarket good prices equal to marginal cost should arise (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b) and specification B in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), the coefficient is found to be exactly one. Finally, when a negative correlation between aftermarket good demand and willingness to pay exists, and firms should actually use metering to subsidize low willingness-to-pay customers, our regression finds a coefficient statistically greater than one.</p><p>These regressions and the simulations in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> are comparable to our empirical example because prices are assumed to be fixed despite temporal variation in . As we stated previously, our test should also hold when the prices are endogenously set by the firm. We therefore reran the simulations from Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and solved for the prices at each realization of . Regressing the log of aggregate aftermarket revenue on the log of aggregate primary good sales, we obtain the regression results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>We can see from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> that, even with endogenously set prices, the same pattern in the coefficients holds. The coefficient in specification B in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> is slightly greater than one, but this is not statistically significant given the standard error reported below it. Specifications A and C in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> are, respectively, below and above one as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Notes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Discussion of Identification in the Context of Movies and Concessions</head><p>We intuitively describe the identification in the context of our empirical application as follows. If a theater has a poor set of movies that lowers its attendance below average or if the outside alternative improves, then the marginal customer from the average week will no longer attend. If we also observe average concession sales per attendee to increase, it tells us that the customers opting not to attend in the week with below average attendance must have consumed fewer concessions per person than those individuals that still attend. In other words, marginal attendees would have lower concession spending than average attendees (the condition from Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)). Identification of this relationship would imply that firms should charge premiums on concessions rather than extracting all consumer value through admission prices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Application and Data Description</head><p>We evaluate whether high margins on aftermarket goods result in metering price discrimination by analyzing the case of concession sales at movie theaters.</p><p>In the introduction we note a growing literature studying the economics of the movie industry, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gil and Hartmann (2007)</ref> is the only other paper that analyzes actual concession sales data. That paper documents stylized facts and trends in concessions but does not consider the economic incentives behind concession pricing.</p><p>The data we use consist of weekly concession sales, box office revenues, and attendance from a Spanish exhibitor. The data span from January 2002 to June 2006 and contain information on 43 different theaters during that time. These 43 theaters are in 30 different cities in 17 provinces.</p><p>Even though we observe 43 different theaters during the five years of data, we do not observe 43 theaters at all times because the Spanish exhibitor sold a few theaters, built up new theaters, and acquired theaters from other exhibitors that exited the market. The sample starts with 24 theaters and ends with 37 theaters. Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses.</p><p>Asterisks indicate significance from one for log(primary demand): * Significant at 10%; * * significant at 5%; * * * significant at 1%.</p><p>The missing six theaters at the end of the sample were mainly old theaters located in Barcelona and Madrid downtown. Most of these missing six theaters were only operated and not directly owned by the exhibitor. In these cases, the owners of the property decided to sell the locations for other uses (housing, supermarkets, or even nightclubs). Theaters that show up in the middle of our panel consist of both newly constructed theaters and newly acquired theaters. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Because we focus on the study of concession sales, we exclude from our analysis those theaters for which the concession sales are outsourced and hence unobserved. After dropping those theaters, we are left with 6,206 weekly observations from 43 different theaters. These theaters differ in size and seating capacity. The theaters in our sample have from 1 to 24 screens and range from 396 to 5,300 seats. Detailed summary statistics are available in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also provides summary statistics for other variables used in our analysis. Weekly attendance varies from 348 to a bit over 40,000 attendees with an average close to 8,900. These numbers denote the skewness of the distribution of attendance across theaters. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also summarizes the forecast error and weekly weather for each theater. The forecast error is defined as the actual attendance minus the week-ahead forecast that is used to determine staffing of concession stands. Large positive forecast errors should therefore proxy for long concession lines. We observe the weather data for most of the observations; however, our data source was missing data for many cities during the month of January 2004. Rain days <ref type="bibr">7</ref> To put this in a historical perspective, the Spanish market was no different than other Western economies in the late 1990s and early 2000s in that it experienced a rapid growth in number of theaters (and screens). This growth came from both new developments and new exhibitors coming in the market. After such rapid growth, movie demand did not respond as industry managers had first anticipated, and exhibitors were required to cut losses and investment. This manifested in the closing of older theaters, cancellation of new projects, and firm exit. The latter two caused a major consolidation in the industry where surviving firms acquired a number of theaters that had been operated until that moment by other exhibitors.  within the week vary from zero to eight, with the eight arising because the final week of one year is classified to have eight days and rain was observed on all eight days. The data also show that the average concession spending per attendee is close to E1.6 and ranges from E0.24 to almost E2.94. Box office per person averages E4.7 and ranges from E2.6 to E6.3. This variable deserves further clarification because it provides information on what type of customer is entering the theater in any given week.</p><p>This firm follows a rather distinct pricing schedule. The firm charges three different prices throughout the week. We can call these different prices a high price p H , a nonpeak price p L , and a discount price p S . The firm charges p H to all individuals attending theaters on Saturdays and Sundays (and festive days). On Wednesdays, the theater charges the discounted price p S to all attendants. Finally, on the other days during the week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday), the theater enforces third-degree price discrimination. During these days, the theater charges the discounted price p S to students and seniors and the nonpeak price p L to all attendants who do not identify themselves as students or senior citizens.</p><p>Therefore, variation in box office per person brings information on the types of individuals attending the theater in any given week compared to other weeks. For example, an increase in box office per person (average ticket price) means that a higher share of attendants arrives during the weekend or that a lower share of students and senior citizens is attending the theater, and therefore tells us information on the average willingness to pay of individuals attending the theater.</p><p>We also use screening data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gil (2004)</ref>. These data provide information on what movies each theater is playing for the first 26 weeks during the year 2002. During those weeks, we only have data for 24 theaters that differ in size from 2 to 16 screens and in seating capacity from 396 to 3,875. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> for detailed summary statistics. We use information on movie characteristics such as movie genre, rating classification, weeks after release, and U.S. box office revenue of the movie. To merge these into weekly theater observations, we weight each movie's characteristics by its total Spanish box office revenue across all weeks. We see that theaters typically have more adventure movies and PG-13 movies than other genres or classifications. We also see that the weighted average weeks after release are 6.21, the weighted average share of opening films is 0.13 and that on average two movies open in a given theater week. U.S. box office revenue is reported in millions and theaters' weekly movie offerings have a weighted U.S. box office revenue average of $185.75 million.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Methodology and Results</head><p>We now analyze the data to evaluate the efficacy of using concession sales to price discriminate across customers with different valuations for movies. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schmalensee (1981)</ref> documented that if marginal attendees demand fewer concessions, then firms would have an incentive to price concessions above marginal cost. We therefore assess how concession sales per person vary as demand shocks lure or deter the marginal theater attendee. We use a variety of fixed effects or other explanatory variables to assure that this relationship is not driven by composition effects. Specifically, we want to be sure that movie-specific effects or other demand shocks are not altering the entire composition of attendees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Empirical Methodology</head><p>In this section, we describe how traditional price discrimination in movie admission tickets (e.g., student and senior discounts as well as discount days or shows) both affects the identification intuition described in §2 and provides an additional test for whether customers with a greater willingness to pay for admission also demand more concessions. Our primary variable of interest is average concession revenue per attendee AR CO = pZ/Q. Given that this aggregates over the pricing classes j ∈ L H S described above, it is useful to decompose AR CO as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">AR CO it = p CO Z H Q H + Z S Q S + Z L Q L Q H + Q S + Q L (9)</formula><p>p CO is the price of concessions. For simplicity and due to data limitations, we will assume that there is a single uniform price for concessions. Recall from the data description that there are three types of customers that enter a theater: Q L is the demand from customers who do not have third-degree price discrimination discounts but do elect to visit the theater in nonpeak periods to pay lower ticket prices, Q H is the demand from customers who elect to visit the theater in a peak-demand period such as a weekend and may or may not have access to third-degree discounts in other periods, and Q S is the demand from customers such as students or seniors who attend in periods when they can realize their discounts. Z j Q j is the total concession demand from customers who paid price j, where the function allows this demand to be increasing or decreasing with the total number of attendees in price category j. By the arguments described in §2, if Z j Q j /Q j / Q j is less than zero, then the marginal customer of type j does consume fewer concessions, and it will be profitable to charge a premium for concessions.</p><p>In our data, we do not observe the demand of each type of customer Q j , but we do have information about the relative size of each group as observed through the box office revenue per person AR <ref type="bibr">BO</ref> , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">AR BO it = p H Q H + p S Q S + p L Q L Q H + Q S + Q L = p H H + p S S + p L 1 − H − S (10)</formula><p>j is the share of attendees who paid price j. Although we also do not directly observe the j s, AR BO informs us whether there is a relatively larger or smaller fraction of customers that pay the full price p H . We now redefine our dependent variable in terms of the j s as well:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">AR CO it = p CO AQ CO H Q H H + AQ CO S Q S S +AQ CO L Q L 1 − H − S (11)</formula><p>where AQ CO j Q j = Z j Q j /Q j is the quantity of concessions averaged across attendees. Under this specification, if AQ CO j / Q j is less than zero, charging a premium on concessions to price discriminate will be profitable.</p><p>Using Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), we can more specifically define the relevant empirical relationships in the data. Our primary relationship of interest is the correlation between AR CO and attendance. If Corr AR CO Q = 0, then we can infer that customers of each type consume a constant amount of concessions, j , such that AQ CO j Q j = j Q j . 8 Under this null hypothesis, it would not be profitable to raise the price of concessions to extract more revenue from customers with higher movie values.</p><p>If this null hypothesis is rejected, a negative sign of this correlation will support the use of a premium on concessions to price discriminate, whereas a positive sign will suggest that the practice may not be appropriate for the purposes of price discrimination. Once again, although we cannot measure the sign of each AQ CO j / Q j , we will evaluate the average effect. This could be rationalized by an assumption that the signs are identical for all types, but this assumption is not necessary for the average effect to indicate the profitability of the price discrimination practice. Clearly, a very negative AQ CO j / Q j could offset a modestly positive AQ CO k / Q k to make the price discrimination profitable.</p><p>Finally, as in §2.4, we estimate the model in logs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ln R CO = Q ln Q + R AR BO + x X +<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Q is therefore interpreted as the percentage increase in concession revenue resulting from a 1% increase in attendance. If Q &lt; 1, we infer that concession revenue per person is decreasing with attendance and that theaters should, in fact, price concessions above marginal cost.</p><p>The presence of AR BO in the above specification serves two purposes. First, it controls for differences Notes. Standard errors are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate significance from zero for all variables, except log(attendance), which is the difference from one: * Significant at 10%; * * significant at 5%; * * * significant at 1%. in the composition of ticket prices paid to avoid confounding estimates of Q . Second, the coefficient R is itself indicative of whether customers with a greater willingness to pay, as identified by paying a higher ticket price, consume more concessions than those customers paying a lower ticket price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Results</head><p>We now begin to analyze this relationship. The first column of Table <ref type="table">5</ref> reports the simple regression of ln R CO on ln Q and AR <ref type="bibr">BO</ref> . In this and all other specifications, asterisks indicate significance from zero for all variables except ln Q , in which case the asterisks indicate significance from one. The estimated coefficient on ln Q is significantly greater than one, but this is primarily due to systematic differences in theaters as is clear from specification (2), which controls for the number of screens and the number of seats per screen at each theater. To account for other unobservable theater characteristics such as local demographics, specification (3) includes theater fixed effects and reveals a coefficient on ln Q that is significantly less than one. This is the primary result suggesting that theaters should charge premiums on concessions to meter willingness to pay for admission. Note that the coefficient on AR BO is also positive, suggesting that groups with identifiably greater willingness to pay for admission consume more concessions per person. The remainder of the specifications illustrates the robustness of these results to a variety of potentially confounding factors. Specification (4) in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> includes week fixed effects to account for seasonality factors such as annually recurring summer or holiday weeks. We see that the signs of the coefficients of interest are unchanged and the effects become stronger in magnitude. Specification (5) interacts the week fixed effects with year fixed effects. This allows us to control for specific market characteristics in any given time period. For example, if a very unique movie was released in a given week across many theaters, this would account for the fact that customers with demand for this movie may be systematically different than customers arriving in other weeks. Once again, the estimated effects only become stronger. The final set of fixed effects is added in specification (6). We interact the theater fixed effects with quarter and year fixed effects. This controls for factors specific to a given theater within a time period. One advantage of this is that it can account for theaters periodically increasing prices to keep up with inflation. The results are also robust to this specification.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> describes specifications accounting for the potentially confounding factors such as concession lines being longer when attendance is greater. In specification (1), we drop all observations in which the attendance for the week is greater than the average attendance at the theater. This removes occasions when lines should be longest (i.e., the highest demand weeks). In this sample of 3,524 theater weeks, we see that the relationship still holds. In specification (2), we include a variable that measures how much actual demand differed from what the theater forecast it to be the week before. Such forecasts are used for staffing purposes such that concession line length should be correlated with how far actual demand differs from forecasted demand. This variable is not  Asterisks indicate significance from zero for all variables, except log(attendance), which is the difference from one: All specifications above include quarter, week, year, and theater fixed effects. * Significant at 10%; * * significant at 5%; * * * significant at 1%. significant and does not alter the relationship between concession sales and attendance. We have also tried including the forecast error in percentage terms and including the forecasted attendance in logs; neither alters the coefficients of interest. Specification (3) explores the robustness to queuing and other confounding factors further by interacting the coefficient of interest, log(attendance), with deciles of the attendance distribution at the theater. We see that the coefficient is not significantly different than the 40 to 50 decile (which is excluded) except for the top decile in which the coefficient is 0.03 lower. This likely picks up the effect of queuing resulting from fixed inputs such as soda machines rather than the variable inputs such as staffing that we proxy for with forecasted attendance. The notion is that when the theater is very busy, there may not be any level of variable inputs that can avoid long concession lines. The encouraging factor about this is that it picks up an additional drop in concession sales per person in these high-attendance weeks without washing out the effect across all other levels of attendance.</p><p>Marketing Science 28(6), pp. 1046-1062, © 2009 INFORMS Specification (3) is also useful because it narrows the scope of any factor that could confound our estimated relationship. It essentially suggests that whatever confounding factor might exist, it must be equally relevant at all attendance levels. This removes the possibility that our findings reflect systematically different types of movies with different concession demand across broadly different levels of attendance. Even within a decile of attendance, the variation in attendance reflects a negative relationship with concession demand per person. The positive relationship between willingness to pay for admission and concession demand is exactly the phenomenon that can explain this within decile relationship.</p><p>In specification (4), we control for weather, which also can affect demand for concessions. The only weather variable that has a significant effect is the average temperature during the summer. It appears that attendees might be consuming more cold beverages, for instance, on hot summer days than on cooler summer days. This also does not alter the estimated relationship between concession sales and attendance.</p><p>Finally, specification (5) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> examines the possible role of interactions between attendance forecast error and attendance decile. The results in this specification show that weeks with positive attendance forecast error do not lower average concession revenue by themselves. Only those weeks with positive attendance forecast error that are within the 90 to 100 decile of attendance seem to have lower average concessions sales. Moreover, because the negative coefficient on the 90 to 100 decile dummy disappears, it seems adequate to conclude that the impact of queuing on average concession sales is not common to all high-demand weeks but rather those highdemand weeks with high unforecasted demand.</p><p>Before closing the discussion of our main results and first round of robustness checks, it is worth a discussion of where our identification comes from; most of the controls used in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> have come out as statistically insignificant and one may wonder what is the source of the underlying variation in demand in our study. Our data set is comprised by theaters belonging to a same theater chain located across cities within Spain, a relatively small country when compared to the United States. This relative homogeneity across observations in our data causes that once we introduce quarter-year-theater fixed effects along with week-year fixed effects we are basically controlling for all weekly common trends across theaters in movie programming or weather. For example, changes in weather may surely drive movie attendance, but as long as weather in Spain is correlated across regions within a week, our weather variables will add little to the presence of week-year fixed effects. The same argument will apply to the results shown in our next section where we control for heterogeneity across time and theaters in movie composition and movie programming. Therefore, any variation left in attendance across weeks and theaters must be due to exogenous shocks that are uncorrelated with unobservable factors fixed across weeks, theaters, and within a quarter and a theater. These would essentially be the s in a Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes style demand model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berry et al. 1995)</ref>, but instead of worrying about how s endogenously determine prices, we are able to exploit fixed prices to allow s to tell us about how the willingness to pay of theater attendees changes across weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The Relation Between Concession Sales and</head><p>Movie Types Although our results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> suggest that estimates are not confounded by other factors, we verify this by also analyzing the characteristics of movies at the theater, which we observe during the first 26 weeks of the general sample. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> shows results of five different regressions using the weighted average movie characteristics (genre, rating classification, U.S. box office revenue, and weeks since release) in a given week at a given theater. Specification (1) replicates the regression in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>'s specification (6) using theater and week fixed effects. From the results in specification (1), we observe that log of attendance is still significantly less than one and, therefore, the marginal consumer left outside the theater values concessions less than the average consumer inside the theater. This result holds in specifications (2) to (5) when we control by movie composition in each theater in any given week. Specification (4) replicates the regression in specification (1), adding genres present in each theater. Science fiction, comedy, and animated seem to have larger concession spending than the excluded genre fantasy. Drama and action genres are not statistically different than fantasy. Specification (3) replicates the exercise of specification (2) but controls for rating classification. We see that "all audience" and PG-13 movies have lower concession spending than the excluded group PG-7 movies. In specification (4), we combine these variables into one regression and find effects for a subset of the characteristics with effects in specifications (2) and (3). The relationship of interest remains significant throughout. Specification (5) in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rosen and Rosenfield (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schmalensee (1981)</ref> to justify charging a premium on concessions to price discriminate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary</head><p>In this paper, we define an empirical approach for analyzing metering price discrimination incentives. We use a general discrete-continuous demand model to show how metering incentives can be assessed by regressing aggregate aftermarket demand or revenue on aggregate primary good demand. To illustrate the ability of the model to recover a firm's aftermarket pricing incentives, we simulate data for a variety of hypothetical distributions of consumer preferences and show that the regressions accurately predict when the price should be above, below, and equal to marginal cost. We then apply our approach to a new and unique data set of weekly concession sales, box office revenues, and theater attendance from a large Spanish exhibitor and find that demand conditions support charging a premium on concessions.</p><p>Despite our results confirming the presence of the demand conditions for metering, we are not certain whether theaters are indeed consciously trying to discriminate across consumers with their aftermarket good pricing strategies. Nevertheless, our empirical results confirm that regardless of the theaters' motivations, high valuation customers end up paying higher total prices (movie ticket and concessions) than low valuation customers, and therefore they are extracting more surplus from high valuation customers. In other words, the theater chain may be engaging in a profitable metering price discrimination strategy even though it is unaware of the strategy.</p><p>The ease of implementation of our approach should make it accessible to managers at other firms to analyze their data to test whether aftermarket prices should be set above cost or not. Although our analysis confirmed the pricing strategy of the chain from which we obtained data, we expect that some markets or industries may not exhibit the same demand conditions. In fact, industries such as hotels and airlines either exhibit variation in whether aftermarket goods are priced at a premium or have recently gone through a regime shift in which formerly free aftermarket goods are now sold at high prices. We hope our analysis and empirical approach can provide guidance in these industries as well. movie theaters and many sports teams, the optimal uniform price for the aftermarket is above cost. Even though all customers demand the same amount of the aftermarket good in a given time period, the fact that they demand more when there is a higher willingness to pay for the primary good implies that a premium on concessions allows the total margin per customer to be greater in peak demand periods, even when prices and costs per unit remain fixed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substitutability Between Primary Good Quality and Aftermarket Demand</head><p>The above illustrates that complementarity between primary good quality and aftermarket demand z biases against a finding supporting aftermarket price premiums, and we now show that substitutability biases in favor of finding aftermarket price premiums. Although the following identifies the type of utility function that could invalidate our result, it is important to recognize that if the two were substitutable, why do we often see them sold together? If substitutability exists between these two, it also suggests the odd incentive that, under admission prices that do not vary across movies, a theater might want to select very poor-quality movies to raise revenue by selling more concessions. Nevertheless, the assumption may perhaps be valid in some instances of metering price discrimination, so we illustrate its bias here. We redefine u 1 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">u 1 = + + z + I − p − wz (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>The additivity of and z inside the parentheses implies perfect substitutability between the two. If consumers could choose and if it were priced per unit of quality, they would spend their entire budget for the system on either primary good quality or aftermarket quantity. However, we assume, as above, that consumers cannot choose . The demand function for the aftermarket good when a positive amount is consumed is therefore z = w 1/ −1 − (16)</p><p>Using exactly the same parameter values as in the complementarity case above, we once again simulate a plot (not shown here) like Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b). The optimal price for the aftermarket is at cost, as expected, but the regression coefficient for our analysis is significantly less than 1 (−1.315). The coefficient itself reveals how odd this utility function and demand function is. The greater the attendance at a movie, the lower the concession revenue, implying that in lowdemand weeks, a few people eat a lot of popcorn, but when movie quality and attendance increase, people stop eating popcorn.</p><p>Using an Instrument to Relax Assumption 2 Finally, if researchers are unable to satisfy Assumption 2, it can be avoided by using an instrument for primary good demand. The instrument needs to be correlated with primary good demand but uncorrelated with aftermarket demand. In other words, only the instrument needs to satisfy Assumption 2 as opposed to all vertical quality shocks satisfying Assumption 2. The predicted primary demand from the first stage in a two-stage least-squares procedure  Notes. Simulations are based on 2,000 individuals across 500 time periods. Regressions are at the aggregate levels, so there are 500 observations in each specfication. Standard errors are in parentheses. * Significant at 10%; * * significant at 5%; * * * significant at 1%. a The aftermarket price in this specification is above cost despite no correlation between customers' willingness to pay and aftermarket demand within a period, because the complementarity of the primary good demand shock and aftermarket demand across periods leads this pricing to be optimal. This arises because of the constraint that the firm must price the same in every period. Setting the aftermarket price above cost effectively allows the firm to "meter" its pricing across time periods. This is only possible if the primary demand shocks really are positively correlated with aftermarket demand. would trace out variation in primary good demand that does satisfy Assumption 2. The second stage would involve regressing log aftermarket demand or revenue on the predicted log primary demand from the first stage. To implement the instrumental variable strategy in the two examples above, we added an additional vertical attribute 2 that satisfies Assumption 2: In both cases, the ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is biased when applied to preferences like Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b), but when the instrumental variables (IV) strategy is used, the coefficient on log primary demand is not significantly different from one. These simulations are reported in </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1 Relationship Between Aftermarket Demand per Person and Primary Good Demand z(w;θ)</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">The "Armchair Economist" at Slate recently pointed out the variation in these hotel pricing policies and questioned why we do not also see variation in concession pricing across different movie theaters<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Landsburg 2006)</ref>. This likely arises because there is much more product differentiation in the types of hotels, whereas most movie theaters are quite similar. In fact, we conducted our tests with theater-specific effects and found that all theaters in the data exhibit the same relationship between concession revenue and ticket sales.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">One exception to this would be if increasing concession consumption for one type of customer was perfectly offset by decreasing concession consumption from another type of customer. This coincidence seems unlikely and could be ruled out by assuming that AQ CO j / Q j had the same sign for all types j.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixed effects Week</head><p>Notes. All regressions contain 622 observations and use theater and week fixed effects. We drop two variables to avoid multicollinearity: fantasy and PG-7 movies. Standard errors are in parentheses. * Significant at 10%; * * significant at 5%; * * * significant at 1%. a theater, after controlling for week-year fixed effects across theaters and within a quarter in every theater. The two opening week measures allow us to identify the relationship of interest within opening weeks and outside of opening weeks. The weighted average Weeks after release further assists in this issue by controlling for effects common to many of the movies postrelease. None of these variables is significant and the estimated relationship between concession sales and attendance does not change. The most likely reason that these are significant is because similar compositions of movies occur across many theaters such that week fixed effects control for these issues. This final specification also includes weighted average U.S. box office revenue of the movies, which also does not affect concession revenue. The specifications throughout Tables 5, 6, and 7 account for most factors that could confound the relationship between concession revenues and attendance. The outstanding result is that when marginal customers are lured into a theater (i.e., attendance increases), the average revenues from concessions decreases. This indicates that these marginal customers consume fewer concessions, which is the necessary condition identified by</p></div>

Relaxing the separability of and z violates Assumption 2. We illustrate this below in a simple Cobb-Douglas example. However, it is useful to point out that the way enters the demand function biases against a metering finding in which prices are predicted to be above cost.</p><p>Suppose that u 1 took the Cobb-Douglas form in the quality of the primary good and the quantity of the aftermarket good z:</p><p>where and are both between zero and one. We retain the linearity in the outside good, as opposed to making it part of the Cobb-Douglas function, because we need consumers to be able to not consume z, and it is easier to ignore income effects as most of the discrete-choice literature does. In Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), is not a choice by the consumer but rather adjusts the utility (and marginal utility) of z up or down. The demand function for the aftermarket good in this case is</p><p>We readily see that Equation ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) violates Assumption 2. This implies that the regression analysis we propose would be biased. However, it is useful to point out that the bias is against a finding that aftermarket prices should be above marginal cost. This direction of the bias arises because increases in increase z such that higher primary demand periods would have more aftermarket sales per person. We illustrate this bias by simulating data in which all consumers have the same aftermarket demand but the regression coefficient for our analysis is significantly greater than one. We set parameters to obtain a plot similar to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b). We use the same covariance matrix as Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b) and set the mean parameters as follows: = 2, = 0 35, = 0 35, and = −1 2. We also change to be log-normally distributed. The resulting plot (not shown here) looks like Figure <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>, but when we run the regression we obtain a coefficient on log primary demand of 3.34. This implies that if, in practice, a researcher finds a coefficient significantly less than one and suspects a utility function similar to Equation (13), then the researcher can be quite sure that aftermarket prices should be above marginal cost. On the other hand, a coefficient above one would only suggest below-cost aftermarket pricing if the researcher is sure the utility function does not imply that increases in primary good quality increase the marginal utility of the aftermarket good.</p><p>There is one interesting point related specifically to ticket pricing that comes from the simulation of this utility function. When the firm is committed to not adjusting the primary good price to changes in , as is the case for most</p></div>			</div>
