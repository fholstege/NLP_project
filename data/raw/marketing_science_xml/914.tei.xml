<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Besides consumer demand, current marketing decisions often influence future company and competitor marketing activity. The 0% financing deals initiated by General Motors as an emergency measure after September 11, 2001 were quickly copied by competitors and continued a year later, even on the new 2003 models <ref type="bibr">(Wall Street Journal, 2002)</ref>. Likewise, escalation of advertising expenditures has been demonstrated in many industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Metwally 1978)</ref>. As a result, marketing managers are urged to consider the net long-term impact of their decisions, which includes dynamic consumer and competitor response, as well as associated future company actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Jedidi et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Krishna et al. 2000</ref>.</p><p>Recent econometric studies compute this net longrun marketing impact by means of impulse-response functions derived from vector autoregressive (VAR) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bronnenberg et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nijs et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pauwels et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Srinivasan et al. , 2004</ref>. In essence, an impulse-response function is the outcome of a "conceptual experiment" that tracks the full chain of events set in motion by a change to the marketing variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pesaran and Shin 1998)</ref>. These events include consumer reactions such as promotion-induced stockpiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Neslin 2002)</ref>, competitor reactions such as retaliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Leeflang and Wittink 1996)</ref>, and company decision rules that back the initial marketing action by (1) prolonging it over time ("inertia"), such as keeping prices low for several weeks after a price promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Krishna et al. 2000</ref>, or (2) supporting it with other actions, such as backing a product-line extension with advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Keller 1998)</ref>. The overtime result of this chain of events is estimated as the net effect of the marketing action on sales. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents two typical examples of such impulseresponse functions, showing the net sales elasticity of a price promotion and a product-line extension. While only the product-line extension effect shows "wear-in," i.e. it takes a number of weeks before the peak sales impact is reached, both impulse-response functions show "wear-out," i.e., it takes several weeks after the peak impact before sales effects die out.</p><p>Even though the net performance effect of a marketing action has strong managerial relevance, it remains unclear which part of it is due to dynamic consumer response, to dynamic competitor response, to company inertia, or to company support. As a result, it is often hard to understand sign and magnitude of the net dynamic impact, and to reconcile it with marketing theory and managerial intuition. Two examples serve as an illustration for tactical as well as strategic marketing actions. First, the absence of a significant postpromotion sales dip in several empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blattberg et al. 1995</ref>) may be due to the fact that prices do not return to their regular levels for several weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Srinivasan et al. 2004)</ref>. A plausible reason for such prolonged company action, as confirmed in recent experiments, is the managerial tendency to weigh past prices when setting future prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Krishna et al. 2000)</ref>. When confronted with evidence of price inertia, managers often want to find out to what extent it contributes to performance impact.</p><p>Second, advertising may fail to affect sales due to its inability to generate consumer response for established brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham and Lodish 1990)</ref>, or due to competitive retaliation campaigns that cancel any demand gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bass and Pilon 1980)</ref>. The distinction between these explanations is crucial, especially if managers obtain information that competitors will not respond as they have in the past. Indeed, in both examples, managers typically have little reason to believe that dynamic consumer response will deviate from historically observed patterns, but may have good reason to expect changes to company actions and/or competitor response. Moreover, several authors have demonstrated the relevance of combining the output of quantitative models with managerial judgment <ref type="bibr">Hoch 1990, van Bruggen et al. 1998)</ref>. Finally, while recent research appropriately models marketing-sales endogeneity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hanssens 1999, Swait and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Andrews 2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lodish (1980)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Shugan (2004)</ref> point out that marketing decision makers may face exogenous constraints and prior commitments that are unrelated to the context of the model. Therefore, it appears useful to combine the flexibility of vector autoregressive models that allow estimation of these dynamic forces, with policy simulations that allow their restriction and separation in conceptual forecasting experiments.</p><p>In this study, we introduce such restricted policy simulations to answer three related research questions. First, what is the dynamic response of consumers (demand) to marketing actions? Second, to what extent do dynamic competitor response, company inertia, and company support add to consumer response in order to form net marketing effectiveness? Finally, do these dynamic forces play a different role for tactical actions, such as (price) promotions, Marketing Science 23(4), pp. 596-610, Â© 2004 INFORMS versus more strategic actions, such as advertising and product-line extensions?</p><p>The following section introduces our methodological framework. Section 3 introduces a rich marketing dataset, while Â§4 reports on the empirical findings. Finally, Â§5 provides conclusions, implications, and areas for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Framework</head><p>All of the above dynamic forces are captured in the time-series modeling framework presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. First, we examine the time-series properties for all sales and marketing variables (as extensively discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dekimpe and Hanssens 1995)</ref>. Based on these properties, we formulate models of the dynamic interactions among sales, marketing, and competitive marketing. Next, we use the estimated coefficients to simulate the net impact of a marketing action on sales, known as the impulse-response function. Finally, we extend the methodology by restricting endogenous variables to their steady-state baseline, which allows separation of consumer response, competitor response, company inertia, and company support. Calculation of the standard errors of these restricted policy simulations allows their formal comparison.</p></div>

First, the vector of endogenous variables log of sales (S), log of focal marketing action (FM), log of own other marketing actions (OM), and log of competitive marketing actions (CM) is related to its own past, allowing complex dynamic interactions among these variables. Second, the vector of exogenous variables typically includes (i) an intercept , (ii) a deterministic-trend variable t, to capture the impact of omitted, gradually changing variables, and (iii) seasonal dummy variables SD <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nijs et al. 2001)</ref>. Finally, Equation (1) explicitly displays the modeling of immediate (same-week) interactions among the endogenous variables. First, sales may be affected immediately by all company and competitive marketing actions through coefficients 0 12 -0 14 . Second, the model assigns causal priority to the focal marketing action, which can immediately affect sales 0 12 , own other marketing actions ( 0 32 , and competitive marketing actions ( 0 42 , but not vice versa. In other words, this causal ordering assumes that companies cannot change their focal marketing activity, observe immediate reaction, and adapt their actions again within the same time period, which makes sense for weekly data of retail-distributed consumer packaged goods <ref type="bibr">Wittink 1992, Dekimpe et al. 1999)</ref>. Our explicit treatment of restrictions on the immediate reactions reflects a structural VAR approach to identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bernanke 1986)</ref>, which is more appropriate 1 for subsequent policy restrictions than weak (implicit) identifying assumptions in the form of either the Choleski decomposition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sims 1980</ref> or of the generalized impulse-response analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shin 1998, Nijs et al. 2001)</ref>. Moreover, we choose to obtain the coefficient estimates and residual covariance matrix by seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Instead, we could estimate these parameters through maximum likelihood estimation by imposing policy restrictions on the residual covariance matrix. In that case, however, any misspecification of a single model equation could have pervasive effects on all the parameters of the system.</p><p>Compared to alternative specifications, VAR models are especially well suited to measure dynamic interactions between sales and marketing variables and to estimate dynamic market response <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Montgomery et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Pauwels et al. 2002</ref>. First, the endogenous treatment of own and competitive marketing implies that they too are explained by their own past and the past of the sales variables. In other words, this dynamic system model estimates the baseline of each endogenous variable and forecasts its future values based on the dynamic interactions of all jointly endogenous variables. Specifically, the VAR model accounts for dynamic consumer response through coefficients k 11 -k 14 , for prolonged company action through coefficients k 21 -k 24 , for cross-marketing company support through coefficients k 31 -k 34 , and for dynamic competitor response through coefficients k 41 -k 44 . Second, dynamic effects are not a priori restricted in time, sign, or magnitude. As for the former, permanent effects are possible for evolving performance variables, and statistical criteria such as the Schwarz Bayesian criterion (SBC) or Akaike information criterion (AIC) suggest lag lengths K that balance model fit and complexity <ref type="bibr">(Lutkepohl 1993)</ref>. As for sign and magnitude, all coefficients are separately estimated and need not adhere to fixed patterns of wear-in and wear-out assumptions. In recent years, VAR models have been used to assess the long-run effects of marketing activity such as advertising, distribution, price promotions, and new product introductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bronnenberg et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">HorvÃ¡th et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nijs et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pauwels et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">Pauwels and Srinivasan 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Srinivasan et al. 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">How to Distinguish Dynamic Forces in</head><p>a Vector Autoregressive System? After estimation of the above VAR model, the researcher could consider several alternative approaches to examine which dynamic forces drive longterm marketing effectiveness. First, one could impose restrictions directly on the estimated coefficients, whose number exceeds (N 2 Ã K), with N the number of endogenous variables and K the number of lags. Wald tests on joint exclusion restrictions allow us to investigate which (sets of) variables contribute significantly to the explanatory power of the model. Unfortunately, several issues may explain the absence of exclusion restriction tests in empirical literature. First, the high degree of multicollinearity among the estimated coefficients complicates the exclusion assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ramos 1996)</ref>. Second, if we follow the test results, the reestimation of the (appropriately restricted) VAR models may still induce omittedvariable bias to the other parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sims 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Faust 1998</ref>. One approach to overcome this issue is to estimate several restricted VAR models and to compare their results <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(HorvÃ¡th et al. 2001)</ref>. Such procedure quickly becomes very elaborate, however, and no statistical significance criteria exist to compare the effect of estimates across different models. As a general strategy, econometric researchers prefer instead to impose restrictions on the long-run, structural impulse responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Enders 1995</ref>).</p><p>An alternative approach to capture the dynamic behavior based on the VAR model is forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD). While impulseresponse functions trace the effects of a shock in one variable on other variables, the FEVD separates the variation in one variable into component shocks to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton 1994)</ref>. In our context, FEVD may help assess the contribution of past sales, marketing, and competitive marketing to current sales, marketing activity, and competitive marketing activity. Specifically, we can apply FEVD for sales to demonstrate the drivers of sales variation, and for marketing activity to demonstrate its dependence on past sales, on past marketing actions, and on past competitive marketing actions. Unfortunately, FEVD does not answer our research question: How do these dynamic forces influencethe net effectiveness of a marketing action? For instance, the fact that competitive marketing activity contributes to the variation in our brand's sales does not necessarily mean that competitive reaction to a specific marketing action is important. In other words, FEVD can at most demonstrate the necessary conditions for the existence of dynamic response. More importantly, FEVD does not give the researcher control to exclude certain response patterns. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For these reasons, we prefer a third approach that maintains the flexible and complete nature of the unrestricted VAR model and imposes restrictions only on the associated policy simulations. In particular, we choose to extend the impulse-response function framework to separate the dynamic results of a marketing action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Impulse Response Functions and</head><p>Their Interpretation Because of their sheer number and multicollinearity, it is infeasible to interpret the estimated VAR coefficients directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ramos 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Sims 1980</ref>. The main interest of VAR modelers, therefore, lies in the net result of all the modeled actions and reactions over time, which can be derived from the estimated coefficients through the associated impulse-response functions. These impulse-response functions simulate the over-time impact of a change (over its baseline) to one variable on the full dynamic system 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Litterman 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Bronnenberg et al. 2000</ref>.</p><p>The impulse-response function's ability to track the full chain of events set in motion by a marketing action, sometimes appears a liability in practical applications. Specifically, unrestricted impulse-response analysis implies a scenario in which historically observed reaction patterns are assumed to persist in the future. Managers often feel uncomfortable with this scenario, as they may have good reason to believe that competitor response and/or company action will differ in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blattberg and Hoch 1990)</ref>. In other words, managers like to know to what extent the predicted net impact of a contemplated marketing action is a result of consumer and competitor response, which are largely outside their control, versus company inertia and support. Therefore, we may specify restricted policy simulations that allow dynamic response only by a subset of the endogenous variables that are expected to behave as they did in the estimation period. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> To the extent that such restrictions do not change the data-generating process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lucas 1976)</ref>, restricted policy simulation analysis combines the high flexibility of VAR models to pick up historical reaction patterns and translate them into a net impact, with the researcher's desire to disentangle this net impact and the managerial desire to predict long-term marketing effects under different competitor reaction and company action scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Restricted Policy Simulations</head><p>We estimate separate policy simulations by restricting different endogenous variables to their VAR-predicted baseline, i.e., unaffected by the marketing change. In the typical case of stationary variables, this amounts to restricting endogenous variables to remain in their steady state. After checking the stability conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton 1994)</ref>, we may write our model in terms of deviations from the steady-state means, summarizing the variables for ease of exposition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s fm om cm t = K k=0 k S â S FM â FM OM â OM CM â CM tâk + u S u FM u OM u CM t (2)</formula><p>The unconditional forecasts for the steady-state deviations for sales (s), the focal marketing action (fm), other marketing actions (om), and competitor marketing actions (cm) are zero for any forecast period. However, what is the forecast for the sales deviation conditional on the knowledge that a focal marketing variable changes by one unit u FM t = 1 ? The answer depends on the endogenous variables that we allow to be affected. Focusing on the sales equation of the VAR system in (2), the conditional sales forecast for p periods ahead is:  (4)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s t+p =</formula><p>A plot of these forecasts against time yields the unrestricted impulse-response function, allowing all endogenous variables to respond according to the historically observed reaction patterns, as captured by all estimated VAR coefficients. If instead we allow only consumer (sales) response, we restrict future own and competitive marketing actions to remain in steady state, i.e., to have zero deviations. In that case, the forecast expressions in (4) greatly simplify to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s t = 0 12 s t+1 = 1 11 0 12 + 1 12 (5)</formula><p>These updated forecasts, plotted as a function of forecast period p, represent the restricted policy simulation of sales to the marketing change, allowing only for consumer response (restricted Simulation 1). Similarly, we add competitor response by allowing deviations from the steady state of the competitor marketing actions (Simulation 2), resulting in the forecasts:Å In a similar fashion, company inertia is added to consumer response by allowing sales as well as the focal marketing action to change over time (Simulation 3). Simulation 4 instead adds company support to consumer response. Finally, Simulation 5 combines Simulations 3 and 4 by allowing for both types of company action. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Standard errors for all impulse-response experiments are computed sequentially for each forecast period by applying the delta method to the estimated autoregressive coefficients and the estimated variance-covariance matrix (see appendix for a detailed discussion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Description</head><p>Extensive marketing-mix data are available for the product category of frozen dinners and entrees. This category is the largest within the frozen food market, with more than $5.9 billion in annual sales (American Frozen Food Institute 2003). In the early 1990s, six national brands competed for the lion's share of the market: Stouffer, Swanson, Healthy Choice, Budget Gourmet, Lean Cuisine, and Weight Watchers. Therefore, we estimate the VAR model in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) with 30 endogenous variables: sales and five marketing actions for each of these six brands. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> summarizes their sales and marketing activity.</p><p>The data set combines 156 weeks of ACNielsen Sales and Causal data with advertising exposure (gross rating points) in the period February 1991-January 1994. For the total U.S. market, we obtain brand 6 sales, price (average price per serving), display (percentage of All Commodity Volume displayed), feature 7 (percentage of All Commodity Volume featured), and advertising (gross rating points). Moreover, we compute product-line extensions as the number of SKUs that are added to the brand's assortment in a given week. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Because the advertising data are collected for Monday-Sunday periods, we align them with the ACNielsen Saturday-Friday periods (assuming equal interaction and feedback effects in VAR models imply that the sales effect of sequentially restricting, e.g., competitor and company action, will not add up to the total sales effect of allowing changes in both variables. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Because advertising data are only available at the brand level, we aggregate the ACNielsen data from the SKU level to the brand level by using the full-period SKU market shares as constant weights, in line with previous applications such as <ref type="bibr">Pauwels et al. 2002 (Footnote 2)</ref>. For our complex dynamic model, this choice preserves degrees of freedom that would be lost by setting aside an initialization period to compute these shares. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out that, while this procedure strictly speaking puts sales at both sides of the equation, this fact is unlikely to affect the results much, as verified by the author for a 399-week dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pauwels 2004</ref>). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> For error normality purposes, we transform the limited dependent variables feature and display by the transformation x/1âx , which expands their 0 1 range into [0, <ref type="bibr">[. 8</ref> Because smaller temporary fluctuations of the product-line variable may be due to a lack of availability or lack of sales, we only count SKU additions that are substantial and persist in the product line for several months.

None of the other exclusion sets hold.</p><p>Second, forecast variance error decomposition shows that, for each brand, sales (consumer response) are driven by its own marketing actions and at least one competitive marketing action.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Policy Simulations for Dynamic Consumer</head><p>Response and the Net Sales Impact Our first research question focuses on the difference between consumer response and net sales impact. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> compares the estimated consumer response, based on the first restricted policy simulation, with the net sales impact based on the unrestricted policy simulation.</p><p>First, immediate consumer response is significantly positive for all marketing actions. In line with previous literature, price promotions have the largest immediate elasticity, followed by product-line extensions, display, feature, and advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Tellis 1988</ref>. Second, dynamic consumer response is negative for price promotions, indicating a postpromotion dip <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blattberg et al. 1995</ref>). In contrast, display and feature show no significant dynamic consumer response <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mela et al. 1998)</ref>, while the more strategic actions, advertising and product-line extensions, enjoy positive dynamic response. Finally, permanent effects are absent for all actions. The average length of the wear-in period is zero for price and nonprice promotions. Indeed, the goal of these tactical  actions is to stimulate immediate action <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Neslin 2002)</ref>. In contrast, both advertising and product-line extensions experience an average wear-in of about one week. As for wear-out, the effects of tactical actions die out in about a week, while advertising and product-line extension effects take, respectively, two and three weeks to die out. The lengths of the estimated advertising wear-in and wear-out times may appear short, but are in line with the few previous studies on weekly data, 13 reporting a 90% duration interval of advertising effects of one to two months <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Little 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Nakanashi 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Sexton 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Simon 1982</ref><ref type="bibr">, Steenkamp et al. 2002</ref>.</p><p>The difference of dynamic consumer response with the net sales impact is significant at the 5% level for price, feature, and advertising, and at the 10% level for product-line extensions. First, the net dynamic effects are higher for all marketing actions, except for display. For the tactical actions, price and feature, negative dynamic consumer response transforms into a positive net sales impact. As a result, the cumulative net impact (immediate + dynamic) is, respectively, 354% and 395% of cumulative consumer response. For the strategic actions, advertising and product-line extensions, positive consumer response is significantly enhanced. The cumulative net impact of advertising is five times higher than its cumulative consumer response, while productline extensions obtain a cumulative net impact that is 262% higher than consumer response only. The size of this difference suggests that either competitor response or company action, or both, greatly contribute to the net dynamic marketing impact.</p><p>Second, the wear-out periods of the net sales impact are typically longer than those for consumer response. Especially noteworthy is the five-week wear-out period for price promotions versus the one-week wear-out of consumer response. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates this scenario for market leader Stouffer. The one-week postpromotion dip in consumer response transforms into several weeks of net sales benefits. Validation analyses (available upon request) show that the above findings are robust to the specification of smaller VAR models and to different choices of lag length and policy simulation comparison criteria (see appendix).</p><p>In summary, we consistently find that the net dynamic impact of marketing actions significantly differs from dynamic consumer response, with display being the only exception. This finding indicates that either competitor response or company action, or both, are very important. We turn to this issue next.</p></div>

In contrast, adding company action to consumer response produces elasticity estimates similar to the net sales impact (numbers in bold). This finding is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">HorvÃ¡th et al. (2001)</ref>, who obtain larger net promotional effects in models that allow for company feedback because "internal decision rules dominate (competitive reactions)" (p. 26). Do we observe this phenomenon because competitors are unaware or unable to react <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen 1996)</ref>?

In other words, at least some competitors react in ways that might reduce the net impact of the initiating marketing action. The observation that  competitive response does not do so indicates that competitor actions might both decrease and increase company sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brandenburger and Naalebuff 1996)</ref>. For advertising, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bender (2000)</ref> notes the simultaneous presence of "confusion" effects and "share of voice" effects and urges researchers to allow for both positive and negative cross effects of advertising. Likewise, promotions for one brand may increase shopper attention to the category and enhance competitor sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Pauwels et al. 2002</ref>. Specifically, the frozen food industry in the early nineties showed great potential for category expansion, as the household penetration rate was still low (American Demographics 1999), despite major technological innovations in the eighties, specific product improvements in the nineties, and the growing household demand for convenience foods (American Frozen Food Institute 2003). <ref type="bibr">14</ref> While company action is the main driver of the net sales impact, the importance of inertia versus support depends on the marketing action. First, for both price promotions and feature, company inertia is the main contributor to the higher net sales impact. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates feature inertia for market leader Stouffer by showing the dynamic response of percent of ACV featured to an immediate 1% increase in ACV featured.

Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates how a product-line extension is supported by increased advertising activity for about two months. Similar support is provided by price reductions and promotional activity. Likewise, advertising obtains a higher sales impact when accompanied by price and/or product changes (i.e., when it has something new to say about the value proposition) and when it is supported at the point of purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alba et al. 1991)</ref>. Such integrated marketing support, exploring synergies across marketing actions, has been advocated in marketing for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kotler 2001)</ref> and formalized in the "Integrated Marketing Communications" framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Schultz et al. 1993</ref>). Moreover, observed marketing action dependencies may also result from the reactions of different decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ehrenberg et al. 2000)</ref>, both within the company (different departments, different managers within one department) and among companies in the supply chain, such as manufacturers and retailers, which may be formalized into an efficient consumer response initiative (Kurt Salmon <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Associates 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Sansolo 1993</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we find that, in this dataset, dynamic competitor response does not contribute to the net impact for any considered marketing action. Instead, company action bridges the gap between consumer response and the net sales impact of a marketing action. In particular, company inertia contributes to the net sales impact for the tactical actions of price and feature, while company support is important for the strategic actions of advertising and product-line extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Three main conclusions follow from the empirical separation of consumer response, competitor response, company inertia, and company support. First, consumer response to a marketing action differs from the net effect, as measured by the unrestricted policy simulation. Whereas dynamic consumer response to a marketing action conforms to marketing theory and managerial intuition, its net sales impact often does not. Therefore, managers and researchers should include supply effects in the net impact analysis of marketing decisions. Second, company action appears to be an important factor over and above consumer response. In other words, company decision dependencies are responsible for a large part of the net impact of a marketing action. Finally, competitive response does not change the net marketing impact in our dataset.</p><p>For tactical marketing actions, company action mostly takes the form of inertia. For instance, the well-known "postpromotion" dip, observed in consumer response, disappears for the net impact because prices stay low for several weeks. This finding confirms previous suggestions that extended <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 23(4), pp. 596-610, Â© 2004 INFORMS</ref> promotional activity may be responsible for masking postpromotion dips <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Blattberg and Neslin 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">van Heerde et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">van Heerde et al. , 2001</ref>. In general, inertia or decision anchoring appears "extremely robust" across experts and across important decisions <ref type="bibr">(Plous 1993, p. 151)</ref>. For strategic marketing actions, company support succeeds in enhancing the positive consumer impact of the initial advertising and product-line changes. Indeed, it makes managerial sense to support important strategic decisions such as productline extensions with all other marketing actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Schultz et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Cooper 1993</ref>. The response separation in our analysis allows assessment of which part of the net product impact is due to the line extension itself versus the supporting marketing actions.</p><p>Managerial implications flow from the expected competitor response and company action to a contemplated marketing action. First, the net effectiveness of typical marketing actions may not depend as universally and strongly on competitive response as previously thought (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pilon 1980, Chen 1996)</ref>. This finding is in line with several recent studies reporting that aggressive competitive reaction is not an important factor in the market behavior of the analyzed categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(HorvÃ¡th et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, Steenkamp et al. 2002</ref>. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sudhir (2001)</ref> also reaches this conclusion with a structural model of strategic interactions among manufacturers and retailers, and retailer pricing rules. While our model is not structural (it is reduced form), it addresses Sudhir's stated limitation that "we have not modeled any kind of dynamics that affect demand or supply That can have intertemporal demand effects, which in turn can affect supply-side behavior" (p. 262). Indeed, the feedback loops in our VAR model allow for both intertemporal demand and supply effects. The fact that two fundamentally different (but complementary) models reach a similar conclusion indicates a more generalizable insight. Moreover, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sudhir's (2001)</ref> empirical analysis investigates categories with high concentration, which facilitates tacit collusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Besanko et al. 1996)</ref>, this study investigates a nonconcentrated category. Still, boundary conditions for the lack of competitive response impact may include the competitive intensity in, and characteristics of, the product category. Therefore, a large-scale replication is needed to investigate the brand and category conditions under which competitor response affects the net long-term impact of a marketing action.</p><p>Second, it appears worthwhile to take a closer look at the nature and profitability of own company decision rules. While the present analysis establishes the presence of company inertia and support and their sales impact, it cannot determine whether this action is deliberate, and whether it is profitable. In case of profitable company action, managers may consider marketing actions whose consumer response by itself is unimpressive. Advertising is a good example; as several studies fail to find significant consumer response for established brands (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abraham and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lodish 1990, Hanssens 1980a</ref>). However, advertising may increase the benefits of promotions and product introductions, as it induces retailer and salesforce support <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ehrenberg et al. 2000)</ref> and draws consumer attention to the improved product value <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hanssens et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In case of unprofitable company action, managers should consider the possibility of changing the dynamic dependencies between marketing actions. Some experimentation is typically needed to determine whether such changes leave the estimated dynamic interactions between consumers, company, and competitors intact <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lucas 1976)</ref>. For instance, managers can return to regular prices faster than usual after a promotion to investigate whether the intended prevention of consumer sticker shock really justifies lost margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kopalle et al. 1996)</ref>. Decision support systems are helpful tools in this respect, as managers who use such systems are less inclined to anchor their decisions on earlier decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(van Bruggen et al. 1998)</ref>. Evidently, the restricted policy simulations may also be used for scenario analysis under specified company and competitor response. Instead of restricting all competitor responses to zero, we could omit competitor response up to or after a certain time period, specify that it will be twice as strong as in the past, or set the response to any value. In each case, we can calculate the dynamic impact of the contemplated marketing action. The usefulness of these simulations depends on the strength of the (qualitative) evidence for such scenarios, which was not available in the analyzed dataset.</p><p>For marketing researchers, our findings on the prominence of expanded company action contribute to growing empirical evidence of, and call for more analysis on, marketing decision dependencies <ref type="bibr">(Steenkamp et al. 2002, van Bruggen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wierenga 2000)</ref>. Far from being a new idea, these dependencies reflect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Forrester's (1961)</ref> forceful argument in favor of feedback loops as the basic constituencies of economic and social systems.</p><p>This study has several limitations that offer useful avenues for future research. First, the dataset is at the aggregate retail level, and thus does not allow modeling of cross-store heterogeneity and strategic retailer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sudhir 2001)</ref>. The fact that the dataset is at the national level renders these issues less germane, but adds potential aggregation bias, including the averaging of product-line extensions over U.S. stores. Second, the data did not provide the information on profit margins and costs necessary to perform marketing profitability analyses. Third, the findings are based on data from well-established, mature product categories. If promotions and advertising induce trial for new products <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham and Lodish 1990)</ref>, their sales effects could be permanent. Moreover, the minor importance of the dynamic competitor response may depend on the competitive environment that companies face. Therefore, future research should expand the restricted policy simulation analysis to different market and competitive conditions and examine whether the current results generalize. Other unanswered research questions include whether competitors react to the marketing action itself or to its impact on their sales (investigation of the direct and indirect effect paths in the VAR model) and whether net sales effectiveness depends on the timing of the marketing action (development of state-dependent models of dynamic interactions). Finally, we strongly encourage future research to find ways to increase VARestimation efficiency and reduce the typically high standard errors.</p><p>As a first step towards separation of dynamic marketing forces, this paper yields three major implications. First, dynamic consumer response largely follows marketing theory predictions for tactical as well as strategic marketing actions. Second, the net dynamic impact differs significantly and substantially from consumer response, except for marketing action display. Third, the major contributor to this difference is not competitor response, but company action in the form of inertia for tactical actions, and of support for strategic marketing actions. Therefore, managers are urged to look beyond dynamic consumer and competitor response and to evaluate company decision rules for inertia and support when assessing longterm marketing effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix. Standard Error Calculation for Restricted Policy Simulations</head><p>We start from Equation (2), as the deterministic components determine the value of the steady-state variables, but have no effect on deviations from it, so both they and derivatives with respect to them are set to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(LÃ¼tkepohl 1990)</ref>. First calculate the derivatives of each endogenous variable with respect to all the parameters, period by period, starting in the period of the impulse. Consider the derivative of sales with respect to 1 11 , the coefficient of lagged sales, when the impulse response function is left unrestricted: Again, these expressions are in deviations from steady state, which simplifies the calculations. Because s m and cm are zero in all periods prior to the impulse, irrespective of the value of 1 11 , the derivative in (A.1) equals zero in all these periods. Having calculated the derivatives of all variables with respect to all parameters, stack the values of the sales derivatives into a vector D s and calculate the quadratic form D s p D s , where p is the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters. At the time of the impulse, all terms in D s equal zero except for the derivative of sales with respect to the 0 coefficients. As the focal marketing action is set to one at that time, the standard error of s will equal the square root of the expression: 42 . In the period following the impulse, these calculated derivatives become the derivatives of the lagged variables, s tâ1 , m tâ1 , and cm tâ1 . The derivatives for the current period can then be calculated and the delta method applied to generate standard errors for the current response to last period's impulse. We repeat this procedure until the end of the response horizon.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s t 1 11 = s tâ1 + 1 11 s tâ1 1 11 + â¢ â¢ â¢ + k 11 s tâk 1 11</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">v</formula><p>To make this calculation when the impulse-response function is restricted, zero out the parameters, variances and covariances corresponding to the restriction. In Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), we are permitting only consumer response, so 0 32 and 0 42 are all set to zero, as are their variances (v 32 and v 42 and all covariances involving these parameters (c 12 32 , c 12 42 , c 13 32 , c 13 42 , and c 14 32 , c 14 42 , and c 32 42 .) The standard error of sales in the period of the impulse is just â v 12 , the standard error of 0 12 . In Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), we also permit competitor response; and the standard error becomes: from the same VAR model. To the best of our knowledge though, guidelines have yet to be developed for such comparison. We distinguish two criteria for comparing the output of policy simulations; the first focusing on the individual impulse-response coefficients, the second on their cumulative impact. Formally, the first criterion states that two policy simulations are significantly different if they yield significantly different coefficients in any period. The second criterion states that two policy simulations are significantly different if their total dynamic impact (i.e., over all dynamic periods) significantly differs. This criterion is more stringent (as significant differences in specific periods may negate each other), and has strong managerial relevance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v</formula><p>For instance, suppose we find that the dynamic impact of a price promotion does not change significantly when we add competitor response. This result implies that managers need not incorporate such response in the benefit analysis of the contemplated price promotion, provided it does not alter historically observed reaction patterns. Therefore, we report the standard errors for the latter criterion and validate with the findings for the former criterion. As for the significance level, one may either apply the t-test significance levels of 10% and 5% or maintain comparability with previous marketing research by applying the one-standard error bands that are used to judge significant differences from zero and from the long-run convergence value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nijs et al. 2001)</ref>, as motivated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pesaran et al.
