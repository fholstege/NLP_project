<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>T he critical role of research and development (R&amp;D) and advertising in the marketing strategy of the firm is well established. This paper conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic expansions versus periods of economic contractions-and whether these results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U.S. firms across a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R&amp;D and advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in R&amp;D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&amp;D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If in contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to choose between either maintaining R&amp;D or advertising, our simulation results show that maintaining R&amp;D is associated with better company performance. We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree of cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant, and they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in highly cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its total effect being 50% larger (market share) and 200% larger (profits) than in industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions. Collectively, these findings provide valuable and actionable insights into how firms should respond to contractions in order to grow profits and market share.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Research and development (R&amp;D) and advertising are among the most important marketing strategy variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mizik and Jacobson 2003)</ref>. Previous research has shown that marketing decisions concerning the intensity of use of these instruments depend systematically on the state of the economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barlevy 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref>). Inspired by these findings and the recent economic turmoil, marketing scientists are becoming increasingly interested in the effect of economic contractions on the effectiveness of R&amp;D and advertising. In good times, management's decisions, whether good or bad, will certainly help steer the success of the firm. In bad times, however, the decisions made have a direct impact on the survival of the firm as the margin for errors is thinner. Even though economic contractions cause considerable turmoil in the market, these trying times offer opportunities to decisively pull ahead of one's competitors, and the smart decisions made by management can have <ref type="bibr">Steenkamp and Fang:</ref> The Impact of Economic Contractions on the Effectiveness of R&amp;D and Advertising Marketing Science 30(4), pp. 628-645, © 2011 INFORMS 629 a tremendous positive impact. Industry reports show that contractions dramatically rearrange the pecking order of companies in many industries and that these shake-ups have long-lasting consequences. More than 70% of the companies that made big strides during a contraction preserved their gains during the subsequent boom, whereas fewer than 30% of the companies that lost ground were able to make it up <ref type="bibr">(Economist 2009)</ref>. Although there are multiple reasons for these dramatic effects, industry analysts have speculated that how companies respond to contractions-in particular, by adjusting their advertising and R&amp;D strategies-plays an important role (American Business <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Media 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">, Economist 2009</ref>. However, despite the intriguing conjectures, we know little about whether, why, and how much the effectiveness of advertising and R&amp;D differs systematically between contractions and expansions. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to fill this gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Related Literature</head><p>Our study primarily builds on three important studies that have examined how advertising effectiveness depends on the business cycle: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deleersnyder et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Srinivasan et al. (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frankenberger and Graham (2003)</ref>. We briefly review each of these papers and discuss how we build on their work.</p><p>The main focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deleersnyder et al. (2009)</ref> is on the cyclical sensitivity of aggregate (country-level) advertising expenditure to the business cycle. They find that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. In a supplementary cross-sectional analysis on 26 large companies, they find that the more procyclical a firm's advertising expenditure is, the worse its long-run stock price performance. A major contribution of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deleersnyder et al. (2009)</ref> study is that it reveals that the preponderant reaction of firms to difficult times is to cut advertising spending and that, furthermore, it is a global phenomenon. Another important contribution is that they establish the causal sequence between economic contractions and advertising spending. They show that economic contractions lead to a decline in advertising expenditure rather than the other way around. We will use these insights in our work. We also use their econometric filtering procedure to derive the occurrence and depth of contraction periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Srinivasan et al. (2005)</ref> introduce the construct of proactive marketing in a recession, which is the firm's interpretation of the recession as an opportunity to develop and execute a response in order to capitalize on the perceived opportunity created by the change. They develop a model of the antecedents and consequences of proactive marketing, and they test the model using cross-sectional survey data among managers. Of particular importance for our work is their finding that firms exhibit large variation in responses to the construct of proactive marketing. It shows that there are firms that use contractions as opportunities to boost performance. We will use their insight that not all firms follow the dominant pattern of cutting back marketing efforts in contractions in our simulation analysis, showing that there are benefits in going against the grain.</p><p>Whereas the previous two studies are crosssectional, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frankenberger and Graham (2003)</ref> use panel data. They estimate the effects of contemporaneous advertising expenditure and past year-on-year changes in advertising expenditure in expansions versus recessions on firm-operating earnings. They find a positive contemporaneous effect for increasing advertising during a recession but negative effects for twoand three-year lagged advertising. <ref type="bibr">Frankenberger and Graham (2003, p. 81)</ref> further conclude that "recessionary decreases in advertising indicate few incremental effects," suggesting that firms need not be overly concerned if they have to reduce advertising during a recession. Their study pioneered extensive longitudinal analyses of business cycle effects on advertising effectiveness for large cross sections of firms. Following their lead, we will also use panel data and study contemporaneous and lagged effects of advertising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Contribution</head><p>The previous discussion shows how we build on the relevant literature. We add to the literature in four major ways. First, we propose a conceptual framework to explain why marketing-mix effectiveness differs between contractions and expansions, taking multiple supply-and demand-side factors into account. We operationalize the framework for advertising and R&amp;D. However, because our framework is derived from an understanding of supply-and demand-side effects of economic contractions, it can also serve as an organizing framework to make predictions about the differential effectiveness of other marketing-mix instruments in contractions.</p><p>Second, we add to previous research by not only studying the effectiveness of advertising but also of R&amp;D across the business cycle.</p><p>Third, we introduce the construct of industry cyclicality to explain differences in advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frankenberger and Graham (2003)</ref> find some differences in advertising effectiveness in contractions between different types of industries (e.g., consumer, industrial, service industries), but it is unclear what gives rise to these differences. We argue that different industries are not equally affected by economic downturns and that we need to take the degree to which Marketing Science 30(4), pp. 628-645, © 2011 INFORMS individual industries are affected by the macroeconomic cycle ("industry cyclicality") into account. We will show that the carryover effects of advertising are very dependent on the cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates and that the effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions.</p><p>Fourth, we contribute to previous work in terms of the execution of the empirical study. In terms of operational measures, advertising and R&amp;D are measured as share relative to competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Reibstein and Wittink 2005)</ref>, and our contraction measure accounts for the severity of the contraction. Furthermore, we use rigorous panel estimation procedures in which we test and correct for a host of confounding factors, which can seriously bias the parameter estimates of interest <ref type="bibr">Staelin 1993, 1995)</ref>. Finally, we conduct validation analyses to examine the validity of our findings. Collectively, these empirical refinements increase confidence in the validity of our findings and will help us avoid some of the quizzical results reported in previous research. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Our empirical contributions are based on a carefully assembled sample of 1,175 U.S. firms representing a variety of business-to-business (B2B) and business-toconsumer (B2C) industries, covering a 35-year period .</p><p>As a result of these contributions, our study responds to <ref type="bibr">Bradlow's (2009, p. 201)</ref> call to conduct research on the impact of "down economic times" on the effectiveness of marketing strategies, rather than to just "sit on the sidelines."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Caveat</head><p>We should note one caveat of our study up front. Like previous research, our focus is on aggregate (advertising and R&amp;D) spending. We have no information on the type of advertising used by firms (e.g., price-oriented versus differentiation-focused advertising). Likewise, we have no information on the type of R&amp;D projects (e.g., process versus product innovation). This kind of information is not available for a large number of firms across the 35-year period considered. In the final section, we will discuss how future research can enrich and expand upon our findings by studying whether the type of R&amp;D projects funded and advertising used varies across the business cycle.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We begin by developing a framework for understanding why the effects of R&amp;D and advertising are expected to be different in contractions versus expansions and use it to formulate hypotheses. We then describe our data and modeling procedure and report the results. We conclude with a discussion of managerial implications, limitations, and opportunities for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses</head><p>We begin by describing supply-and demand-side effects of economic contractions. We use these insights as an organizing framework to develop hypotheses as to how contractions systematically moderate the effects of advertising and R&amp;D on firm performance. Finally, we consider the role of the degree of industry cyclicality because different industries are not equally affected by general economic conditions.</p><p>In our conceptualization and measurement of advertising and R&amp;D, we are guided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reibstein and Wittink (2005)</ref>, who advocate the use of measures relative to that of competitors. In this paper, rather than using absolute dollar expenditure, we use "advertising share" (called "share of voice" in the advertising literature) and "R&amp;D share." The intensity of these instruments, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales, differs dramatically across industries. 2 Consequently, relative measures for R&amp;D and advertising (as opposed to absolute measures) are more comparable across industries and managerially more meaningful. Moreover, our theorizing is based on R&amp;D/advertising activity relative to competitors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reibstein and Wittink (2005)</ref> further argue that relative marketing metrics are more useful than absolute measures over changing economic conditions. They maintain that the important question to ask is, "How are we doing relative to our competitors who operated under the same economic conditions" <ref type="bibr">(Reibstein and Wittink 2005, p. 8)</ref>. This point of view is shared by practitioners. For example, industry analyst <ref type="bibr">Tubbs (2007, p. 23</ref>) maintains that "a company that underinvests in R&amp;D relative to its principal sector competitors will see a decline in its relative competitiveness of its products and services and this will soon be reflected in its business performance."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Conceptual Framework for</head><p>Hypothesis Development Business cycles consist of periods of expansion, alternating with periods of contraction, and they last between 1.5 and 8 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Christiano and Fitzgerald 1998)</ref>. Economists have examined the relationship between business cycles and various macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and consumption. The general finding is that the business cycle has profound effects on supply and demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bodman 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Razzak 2001</ref>. In this paper, we focus on those supply-and demand-side factors that are directly relevant for understanding how R&amp;D and advertising effectiveness may differ between expansions and contractions. Consistent with the positioning of the paper, our focus is on how specific supply-and demand-side factors change in contractions, using the expansionary period as a benchmark.</p><p>2.1.1. Supply-Side Effects. In a contraction, firms feel a strong urge to cut discretionary costs as fast as possible. The reason is that in a contraction, demand typically falls faster than supply, and fast action is needed in order to survive the difficult times. Expenditures on marketing activities are among the first to be cut in adverse conditions <ref type="bibr">(Deleersnyder et al. 2009, Mizik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jacobson 2007)</ref>. This reduces the competitive interference, or "clutter," in the marketplace. Competitive interference arises from marketing activities (e.g., advertising) that are delivered simultaneously by competing companies at or near the same time and place as the focal company <ref type="bibr">(Danaher et al. 2008, p. 212)</ref>. In contractions, as many companies cut back on their marketing expenditure, clutter will be reduced.</p><p>Moreover, the pressure to cut marketing expenditure exerts a downward pressure on production costs, broadly defined as the costs of achieving a particular output (e.g., an advertising campaign) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kamber 2002)</ref>. Because demand for such output is scarcer, the firm is able to negotiate more favorable purchase conditions. A third supply-side effect concerns the quality of production <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barlevy 2007)</ref>. Whether sourced internally (as is often the case for R&amp;D) or externally (typically the case for advertising), there is more pressure to perform as job security is lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Demand-Side Effects.</head><p>A defining characteristic of a contraction is a decline in demand for the firm's goods. The ability and willingness of the firm's customers to buy its products decrease during contractions. They need to economize on their expenditures by reducing the quantity bought or by postponing their purchases altogether until the economy improves <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Katona 1975)</ref>. Also, tighter budgets and the general uncertainty pervading the economy make people more price sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Estelami et al. 2001</ref>). Finally, it has been shown that adverse economic conditions make people more risk averse <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollerslev et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, the literature indicates that in a contraction, competitive interference and the costs of producing the activity are likely to be lower, whereas the quality of the marketing activities is higher (supply-side effects). Furthermore, market demand for the firm's output is likely to be lower, whereas the price sensitivity and risk aversion of the firm's customers will be higher (demand-side effects).</p><p>We use the specific supply and demand effects as an organizing framework for developing hypotheses as to why the effectiveness of advertising and R&amp;D is different in contractions versus expansions. Note that our focus is not on testing individual supply or demand effects separately (for which data are typically not available over such a long time period). Instead, the goal is to consider in a systematical fashion how each supply-and demand-side factor affects the effectiveness of advertising or R&amp;D in contractions. By organizing these different effects using this framework, we keep the discussion tractable. Based on this conceptual analysis, we derive hypotheses about the overall net effect of R&amp;D share and of advertising share in a contraction versus an expansion. These resulting hypotheses will be tested in our empirical study (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Narasimhan et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ailawadi et al. 2010</ref> for a similar approach).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> summarizes our predictions. A plus sign signifies that we expect that the supply-or demandside factor in question leads to an increase in advertising/R&amp;D effectiveness in a contraction (versus an expansion), a minus sign signifies a negative impact, and a blank space means that we have no compelling reason to expect a strong impact in either direction (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Narasimhan et al. 1996)</ref>. Below, we will discuss the rationale for our expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Advertising Effectiveness in Contractions</head><p>There is widespread agreement that the duration of advertising's effects tends to be relatively short. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Erickson and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobson (1992, p. 1269</ref>) conclude that "[m]ost studies of the carryover effects of advertising conclude that the primary effects do not last beyond one year." Advertising may yield long-term effects, such as brand equity, yet if these benefits do not emerge in the short run, there is little room for them to emerge later. Memory decay processes can explain this situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Naik et al. 1998)</ref>. There is no compelling reason to expect that the duration interval is longer in contractions as there is no evidence that memory decay processes operate differently in contractions. However, we will empirically test whether advertising in contractions has longer-lasting effects. Although we do not anticipate differential duration effects, we do expect that advertising's effectiveness within this duration interval will be greater in contractions than in expansions because of several supply-and demand-side effects.  2.2.1. Supply-Side Effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deleersnyder et al. (2009)</ref> have shown that every time the economy enters a downturn, advertising budgets are among the first to be cut. Many firms view advertising as a discretionary expense that can be reduced easily during harsh economic times. Companies can easily postpone advertising activities during an economic contraction, and advertising can easily be ramped up again when the economy improves. Lower advertising activity by firms reduces competitive interference in the category. Consumer researchers have documented that intensive exposure to ads for competing brands results in the retention of overlapping memory traces of content. This overlap inhibits retrieval of distinctive ad information when sought elements become inaccessible or are confused with information stored in memory. This results in lower ad recall and recognition, and therefore less favorable brand evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burke and Srull 1988)</ref> as well as lower sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Danaher et al. 2008)</ref>. As advertising activity falls in contractions, clutter will be reduced. Consequently, a firm that increases its level of advertising activity relative to competitors (i.e., increases its share of voice) in tough times can expect a larger effect on firm performance compared to when it would increase its share of voice in good times. This notion is widely shared by advertising agencies. They have long maintained that contractions "provide companies with rare opportunities to boost market share and long-term profitability by taking advantage of the increased share of voice available to advertisers who increase their media expenditures during periods when competitors are forced to cut back" <ref type="bibr">(Kamber 2002, p. 106)</ref>.</p><p>Industry evidence indicates that the general decline in advertising expenditure in a contraction gives firms the opportunity to negotiate better deals with ad agencies and networks. Consequently, one can expect that firms that increase their advertising share in contractions will be able "to get better deals in light of the rapidly declining ad markets and the wholesale retreat of entire sectors of advertisers" (Parekh 2009, p. 7). There is little specific evidence on the quality of advertising campaigns in contractions versus expansions. Hence, we refrain from making a prediction, but it is plausible that only the best creative talent will be retained by advertising agencies in a contraction with commensurate positive effects on the quality of campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Demand-Side Effects.</head><p>Reduced market demand in contractions will intensify the competition in the industry. With increased competition, advertising becomes even more important to retain existing customers and to attract new customers from competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gatignon 1984)</ref>. Firms that increase their advertising relative to their competitors, therefore, should see a stronger positive effect on firm performance.</p><p>To understand how higher price sensitivity in contractions may affect advertising effectiveness, we must distinguish between price-oriented and differentiation-focused advertising. The effectiveness of price-focused advertising is likely to be higher in contractions as the advertising message resonates more closely with what is on the mind of the firm's customers. On the other hand, differentiation-focused advertising could be less effective in contractions. It may turn customers away from highly advertised products, which may be perceived to be more expensive than less advertised products. To the extent that advertising content changes from differentiationfocused to price-oriented advertising, we may expect that this has a positive effect on advertising effectiveness in contractions. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wiggins and Lane (1983)</ref> demonstrate analytically that high advertising effort signals lower quality risk to customers. These authors conclude that risk-averse consumers should purchase highly advertised products. In contractions, risk aversion is higher, so firms that increase their advertising efforts relative to their competitors should attract more customers.</p><p>Our discussion of the supply-and demand-side factors, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, suggests the following hypotheses.</p><p>Hypothesis 1A (H1A). Increasing advertising share has a positive effect on market share and profits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1B (H1B).</head><p>Increasing advertising share in contractions has a greater effect on market share and profits in contractions than in expansions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">R&amp;D Effectiveness in Contractions</head><p>There is general agreement that the duration interval for R&amp;D is considerably longer than the duration interval for advertising, but there is less agreement on the length of the R&amp;D lag structure <ref type="bibr">Staelin 1995, Ravenscraft and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Scherer 1982)</ref>. In this paper, we are guided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Erickson and Jacobson (1992)</ref>, according to whom a three-year lagged structure captures approximately 80% of the total effect of R&amp;D. There is no compelling reason to expect that the duration interval would systematically vary across the business cycle. However, we will empirically test whether R&amp;D in contractions has longerlasting effects. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> When considering R&amp;D activities, it is common to distinguish between process and product innovations. Process innovations are discoveries of new, typically cheaper methods for producing existing products, whereas product innovations concern the creation of new goods and services <ref type="bibr">(Pepall et al. 2008, p. 576)</ref>. Process innovations can contribute to firm profit by lowering production costs as well as to market share by allowing the firm to remain price competitive, a result of greater production efficiency. Product innovations contribute to market share and profit by meeting existing demand and/or creating new demand. Supply-side effects play a role for both types of innovations, whereas demand-side effects primarily apply to new product development (NPD)-focused R&amp;D. 5 2.3.1. Supply-Side Effects. The need to cut costs in contractions will not be limited to advertising. Barlevy ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>) reviews a wealth of evidence showing that firms' R&amp;D expenditures behave procyclically as well. The labor market for top technical talent is fiercely competitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Tabrizi and Chaudhuri 1999)</ref>. Firms that maintain or even increase their R&amp;D efforts while other firms cut back can use the contraction as an opportunity to lure star employees away from competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barlevy 2007)</ref>. Thus, in contractions, we can expect a higher quality of R&amp;D production.</p><p>Although firms may be reluctant to cut the wages of their employees, new hires may receive lower wages because of a relative oversupply of technical workers' asymmetry in the job market in contractions. Moreover, in contractions, hardware might be procured at lower prices because demand has fallen.</p><p>Reduced competitive clutter also plays a role, but only for NPD-focused R&amp;D and only in the longer run. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Shleifer (1986)</ref> points out that firms find it in their best interest to introduce new products in expansionary periods. However, this does not imply that R&amp;D activity underlying these innovations should occur in economic booms. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Francois and Lloyd-Ellis (2003)</ref> show that it is optimal for firms to engage in NPD-focused R&amp;D during contractions when it conflicts less with production-and wait until economic conditions improve before introducing them. In the longer run, as the economy improves, the company that maintained R&amp;D share will have new products "shelf ready." These innovations are introduced in a marketplace where demand is rising again but that is less cluttered because the firm's competitors are struggling to ramp up their R&amp;D <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Francois and Lloyd-Ellis 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.3.2.</head><p>Demand-Side Effects. The reduced market demand that characterizes contractions will also reduce demand for the output of NPD-focused R&amp;D, at least in the short term until demand picks up again. Furthermore, new products are typically perceived to be riskier than established products because there is no track record of their performance. In tight economic times, there is an urge to play it safe because the (financial) margin of error is less. Higher risk aversion in contractions is thus likely to hurt the effectiveness of NPD-focused R&amp;D in the short run.</p><p>In sum, our discussion indicates that a strategy of increasing R&amp;D share in contractions will be associated with higher firm performance. Although there is some potential for a short-run effect on firm profit, via process innovations, the positive effect of increasing R&amp;D share in contractions is likely to emerge only in subsequent years.</p><p>Hypothesis 2A (H2A).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>Our research setting is publicly traded U.S. firms from a broad range of industries for the period 1971-2005. We obtained data from the COMPUSTAT industry annual database and the COMPUSTAT business segment database. We did not use the COMPUSTAT quarterly database because some key variables such as advertising expenditure are not available on a quarterly basis. The COMPUSTAT databases are heavily dominated by B2B. To avoid a skew in our results toward B2B firms, we randomly selected 600 firms from B2B industries. We combined this set of companies with 575 firms from B2C industries for a total sample of 1,175 firms.  t , by fitting a smooth curve through a set of data points. To identify both components, one minimizes the variance of the cyclical component subject to a penalty for variation in the second difference of the trend component. The cyclical component, which fluctuates around that trend, is then obtained by subtracting the long-term trend from GDP t ; i.e., GDP c t = GDP t − GDP l t <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hodrick and Prescott 1997)</ref>. The HP filter obtains GDP l t by minimizing</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T t=1 GDP t − GDP l t 2 + T −1 t=2 GDP l t+1 − GDP l t − GDP l t − GDP l t−1 2 (1)</formula><p>where GDP t is the log-transformed GDP series at year t. The log transformation ensures that the units of GDP c t , when multiplied by 100, represent percentage deviations from the economy's long-term growth path <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Stock and Watson 1999)</ref>. Penalty parameter determines the degree of smoothing, with larger values resulting in a smoother growth component. As business cycles exhibit cycles of varying length that tend to last no longer than eight years in duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Christiano and Fitzgerald 1998)</ref>, our smoothing constant is chosen to generate a trend accounting for all fluctuations longer than eight years. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baxter and King (1999)</ref>, who recommend a value of equal to 10 for annual series (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Lamey et al. 2007</ref> for similar practices). This value produces a good correspondence between the HP filter and an ideal bandpass filter that passes through cycles between two and eight years.</p><p>Following established practice in business cycle economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baxter and King 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Hodrick and Prescott 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Lamey et al. 2007</ref>), the economy is in contraction when there is a decrease in the cyclical component of GDP (GDP c t )-that is, when the economy in year t grows less than its longterm trend (i.e., when GDP l t &gt; GDP t ). To quantify the magnitude of the contraction in any given contraction year, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lamey et al. (2007)</ref> and specify the following asymmetric growth model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">contr t =        0 if gdp c t c &gt; 0 prior peak in gdpc c − gdpc c t if gdp c t c ≤ 0 (2)</formula><p>The variable contr t is expressed as a percentage. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> If contr t = 0, the economy is growing at or above its long-term trend. Thus, the effects of contraction will be tested against the benchmark of economic expansion. 8</p><p>3.2.2. Firm Performance. We obtained firm profit data, expressed in millions of dollars, from COMPU-STAT's industrial annual net income (data#13). Market share is expressed as a fraction and is calculated as the firm's sales revenue divided by the sales of all firms in the same industry (i.e., the same fourdigit standardized industry classification (SIC) code), which we gathered from the COMPUSTAT segment database. For a firm that operates in multiple industries, we obtained sales revenues in all the industries in which it is active using the corresponding fourdigit SIC codes. Four-digit SIC codes represent the most disaggregate level in COMPUSTAT. We aggregated the sales of all firms in these four-digit SIC codes to arrive at industry sales. Finally, we calculated a firm's overall market share as the sales-revenueweighted average of its market share across its different business segments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.3.</head><p>Advertising and R&amp;D Share. Data on companies' advertising and R&amp;D expenditures came from COMPUSTAT advertising expenses (data#45) and R&amp;D expenses (data#46), respectively. Advertising (R&amp;D) share is expressed as a fraction and is calculated as the firm's advertising (R&amp;D) expenditure divided by those of all firms in the same industry (i.e., the same four-digit SIC code). The information was obtained from the COMPUSTAT segment database. For a firm that operates in multiple industries, we gathered advertising and R&amp;D expenditure in all the industries in which it is active, using the corresponding four-digit SIC codes. We aggregated the advertising and R&amp;D expenditure of all firms in these four-digit SIC codes to arrive at industry overall advertising and R&amp;D expenditure. Finally, we calculated a firm's overall advertising and R&amp;D share as the revenue-weighted average of its advertising and R&amp;D shares across its different business segments.</p></div>

For a firm that operates in multiple industries, we calculated a firm's overall cyclicality as the revenue-weighted average of the industry cyclicality across its different business segments.</p><p>3.2.5. Control Variables. Firm size is operationalized as the log of firm total assets measured in millions of dollars. The firm's primary industry is identified by its primary four-digit SIC code in the COMPUSTAT database. The degree of concentration of the firm's primary industry (based on its primary four-digit SIC code in the COMPUSTAT database) is operationalized by the Herfindahl index, where larger values indicate a more highly concentrated industry.</p></div>

Based on our literature review, we specify K ADV = 1 and K R&amp;D = 3. There is no literature to guide us on the number of lags to be expected for CONTR. Therefore, we specify K CONTR = C.

Similarly, the coefficients 0 t−b represent the distributedlag effects of R&amp;D share when the economy is in an expansion, and the coefficients 1 t−a represent the change in the effectiveness of R&amp;D when the economy is in a contraction.

Coefficients 1 and 2 are the effects of the control variables' firm size and concentration, respectively, in the firm's primary industry, and 3 captures the (time-invariant) main effect of industry cyclicality. For models with firm profit as the dependent variable, we also included contemporary market share as a predictor. Its coefficient ( 4 captures the possible effect of market share on firm profit. Coefficient i captures unobserved, fixed firmspecific factors. Finally, with our specification for the error term , we control for random contemporaneous and first-order autoregressive unobserved factors.</p><p>When we substitute Equations ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">8</ref>) in Equation (4) and take logs, we obtain the following theoretical model specification that we set out to test in our empirical study:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ln Y i t = 0 + 1 a=0 0 t−a + 1 t−a CONTR t−a + 2 t−a CYC i + 3 t−a CONTR t−a × CYC i × ln ADV i t−a + 3 b=0 0 t−b + 1 t−b CONTR t−b × ln R&amp;D i t−b + C c=0 t−c ln CONTR t−c + 1 Size t + 2 InduCon t + 3 CYC i + i + i t−1 + i t (9)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Advertising Effectiveness in</head><p>Expansions and Contractions We find that in expansionary periods, advertising share has a positive contemporaneous effect on market share ( 0 year t = 0 0710, p &lt; 0 01) as well as a significant one-year carryover effect ( 0 year t−1 = 0 0529, p &lt; 0 05). Advertising also has a significant direct effect on contemporaneous profit ( 0 year t = 0 1459, p &lt; 0 05), as well as an indirect effect via market share ( = 0 0137, p &lt; 0 05) for a total contemporaneous effect of advertising on profit of 0.1596. 13 These findings support H1A for both performance measures. It clearly pays to advertise.</p><p>How is this picture modified when the economy is in contraction? We find that contractions offer courageous companies that maintain their advertising while others cut back (thus increasing their share) a unique opportunity to strengthen their market position. Advertising effectiveness increases in contractions, both for building market share ( 1 year t = 0 0024, p &lt; 0 01) and profit ( 1 year t = 0 0059, p &lt; 0 05). To get a sense of the magnitude of the effect, consider that year t was a typical contraction year, experiencing a median decline of 2.74%. Consistent with our model estimation, this median value is multiplied by 10. In a typical contraction year, the contemporaneous effect of advertising on market share is calculated as 0 1368 = 0 0710 + 27 4 × 0 0024) (p &lt; 0 01). This is nearly twice as high as the effect of advertising in an expansion year. Advertising's direct effect on contemporary profit in a typical contraction year (0.3076) is also considerably larger than advertising's effect in an expansion year (0.1459). Thus, H1B is supported. Advertising in contractions is significantly more effective than advertising in expansions in building market share and profit. Furthermore, we find that this increased effectiveness emerges in the same year in which the firm advertises. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Significance of the indirect effect is derived using the Aroian version of the Sobel test <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baron and Kenny 1986)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">R&amp;D Effectiveness in Expansions and Contractions</head><p>In expansionary periods, R&amp;D share has a positive effect on market share, which carries over for three years: 0 year t−1 = 0 0689 (p &lt; 0 01), 0 year t−2 = 0 0613 (p &lt; 0 05), and 0 year t−3 = 0 0589 (p &lt; 0 05). The contemporaneous effect is not significant. This is consistent with earlier work that suggests that firms expect a lag of at least one year before revenue returns to R&amp;D spending start to emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pakes and Schankerman 1984)</ref>. We further find that R&amp;D has a positive contemporaneous effect on profit ( 0 year t = 0 1301, p &lt; 0 05), as well as a two-year lagged effect ( 0 year t−2 = 0 1789, p &lt; 0 05). The effect for year t − 1 is also positive but is not significant. These findings support H2A.</p><p>It is interesting to see that R&amp;D has an immediate effect on profit but not on market share. R&amp;D activities can have a short-term effect on firm profit (through cost-reducing process innovation), but their effect on sales (through product innovation) will usually take longer to materialize because it takes time before new products gain market acceptance.</p><p>R&amp;D effectiveness is systematically affected by economic contractions. When the economy is in a contraction, we find one-and two-year lagged positive effects on market share: 1 year t−1 = 0 0024 (p &lt; 0 05) and 1 year t−2 = 0 0024 (p &lt; 0 05). To illustrate, if the economy was in a typical contraction in one of those years, it would about double the effect of R&amp;D share for that year on contemporary market share. If the economy was in a typical contraction in both years t − 1 and t − 2, the total effect of R&amp;D share (aggregated across the three lagged years) on contemporary market share in expansions would be 0.1891, whereas the effect in a typical contraction for the past two years would be 0.3207, an increase of 70%. 14 Increasing R&amp;D share in contractions is also more effective in building profit than increasing R&amp;D share in expansions. Again, the positive effects take at least one year to materialize: 1 year t−1 = 0 0079 (p &lt; 0 01) and 1 year t−3 = 0 0064 (p &lt; 0 05). In sum, our findings support H2B. Increasing R&amp;D share has a greater effect on both profit and market share in contractions than in expansions, but these effects emerge only in subsequent years.</p></div>

In expansions, we find an effect (one-year lagged) both for market share ( 2 year t−1 = 0 0371, p &lt; 0 05) and profit ( 2 year t−1 = 0 1750, p &lt; 0 05). These results provide support for H3A.</p><p>The effect of cyclicality is strong. In expansions for firms in stable industries, all market share benefits of advertising accrue in the same year, the lagged effect being nonsignificant, for a total effect of 0.0671. In contrast, in industries of average cyclicality, the total effect of advertising on market share is 0.1239, whereas that effect increases to 0.1807 in highly cyclical industries. 15 Thus, in expansionary ("normal") times, advertising effectiveness in highly cyclical industries is approximately three times larger than advertising in stable industries and 50% higher than advertising in industries of average cyclicality. The findings for profit follow the same pattern and are even stronger. The total effect of advertising is 0.1459 in industries of average cyclicality versus 0.4140 in highly cyclical industries. In stable industries, advertising's effect of profit is negligible. Thus, the carryover effects of advertising are very dependent on the cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable industries, advertising effects are small and do not go beyond the year the firm advertises.</p><p>Consistent with H3B, we find that the effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions (market share: 3 year t−1 = 0 0020, p &lt; 0 01; profit: 3 year t−1 = 0 0058, p &lt; 0 01). These results unequivocally demonstrate that advertising is more effective in highly cyclical industries, and this increased effectiveness is even more pronounced in contractions than expansions.</p></div>

(2003)</ref>, high (low) cyclicality is operationalized as one standard deviation (1.532) above (below) the mean. We assume that R&amp;D share remains constant, which allows us to add the coefficients. The total (contemporaneous and oneyear lagged) effect of advertising in highly cyclical industries is 0 1807 = 0 071 + 0 0529 + 1 532 × 0 0371 versus 0 1239 = 0 071 + 0 0529 in industries of average cyclicality and 0 0671 = 0 071 + 0 0529 − 1 532 × 0 0371 in stable industries, i.e., industries characterized by relatively low cyclicality.</p><p>tions in systematically moderating R&amp;D and advertising effectiveness. A logical benchmark model is a model that does not include any effect of the business cycle. This benchmark FDL 1 3 model specifies that one needs only information on R&amp;D and advertising share (together with control variables) to explain firm performance. Thus, the benchmark model is nested in our model, in that our model adds eight interactions involving contraction (as well as the contemporaneous and lagged main effects of contraction). To compare the performance of our model versus the benchmark model, we randomly split our sample into an estimation sample of 850 firms (approximately 75% of the sample) and a validation sample comprising the remaining 325 firms. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We estimate the two models on the estimation sample and use the validation sample for out-of-sample forecasting.</p><p>We performed two model comparison tests. First, we performed an F -test on difference in model fit between the two models using the estimation sample. Our model has significantly better model fit (F 12 3 486 = 4 82, p &lt; 0 001 for market share; F 12 3 724 = 5 66, p &lt; 0 001 for firm profit). Second, we use the parameter estimates to predict market shares and profit of the firms in the validation sample. Mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean squared error (MSE) are used as model comparison measures. We find that our model consistently outperforms the benchmark model in out-of-sample forecasting: Because our data span multiple decades, it is possible that our substantive coefficients exhibit temporal variation, for example, because managers are starting to view marketing as a strategic investment. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> To assess the temporal stability of the parameter estimates, we divided the sample into two time periods <ref type="bibr">: 1971-1988 and 1989-2005</ref>. We estimated our model for both periods separately. The Chow test indicates that the null hypothesis of no difference in the vectors of parameter estimates cannot be rejected (F 23 4 384 = 1 052, N.S. for market share; F 24 4 618 = 1 213, N.S. for firm profit). Tests on differences between parameter estimates for individual predictors, using the Bonferroni correction with overall p &lt; 0 05, yield no significant results for either the market share or firm profit models. 4.4.3. B2C vs. B2B Firms. We examined whether there are systematic effects between B2B and B2C firms. We estimated our model for each group of firms separately. The Chow test is again not significant (F 23 4 755 = 0 828, N.S. for market share; F 24 4 851 = 0 962, N.S. for firm profit). Tests on differences between individual coefficients, using the Bonferroni correction, yield only one significant result for the market share model but none for the firm profit model. 4.4.4. High vs. Low Industry Advertising Intensity. We tested whether the effects of advertising and R&amp;D share are asymmetric between high and low advertising (R&amp;D) industries. For example, in high advertising intensity industries, a firm's advertising share can be low even if its absolute dollar volume is high. Conversely, in low advertising intensity industries, a firm's share can be high even though it does not spend much advertising dollars. We divided the industries into high and low advertising intensity industries, based on a median split on overall industry advertising dollar volume. We estimated our model for each group of firms separately. The Chow test indicates that the null hypothesis of no difference in the vectors of parameter estimates cannot be rejected (F 23 4 826 = 1 1065, N.S. for market share; F 24 4 965 = 0 689, N.S. for firm profit). Tests on differences between individual coefficients, using the Bonferroni correction, yield only one significant result for market share and none for firm profit.</p><p>We repeated this procedure with high versus low industry R&amp;D intensity. Again, the Chow tests are not significant (F 23 4 619 = 0 975, N.S. for market share; F 24 4 877 = 0 730, N.S. for firm profit). Tests on differences between individual coefficients, using the Bonferroni correction, yield no significant result for either market share or firm profit model. 4.4.5. Differential Duration of R&amp;D or Advertising Effects in Contractions. We finally investigated whether the duration of advertising and R&amp;D differs between expansions and contractions. It is possible that duration effects last longer when they occur in contractions. To test this idea, we added an additional lag to our model. More specifically, we included the interaction term between Contraction and R&amp;D share, between Contraction and Advertising, and between Contraction and Advertising × Industry Cyclicality one period beyond what is specified in the model (i.e., t − 2 for advertising, t − 4 for R&amp;D). None of these interaction terms is significant at the 0.10 level or better. This suggests that there is no compelling evidence that the duration effects of advertising or R&amp;D differ between expansions and contractions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Summary</head><p>The critical role of R&amp;D and advertising in the marketing strategy of a firm is well established. Consequently, these instruments have been the focus of considerable research attention. Therefore, it is surprising that little research has been conducted on their effectiveness in relation to the general economic conditions in which the firm operates. After all, companies do not operate in a vacuum but are rather part of our market-based economic system and hence are subject to its fluctuations. In this paper, we have attempted to contribute to filling this void.</p><p>We proposed a conceptual framework to explain why the effectiveness of marketing instruments differs between contractions and expansions, taking multiple supply-and demand-side factors into account. Using this framework, we developed hypotheses concerning the moderating role of economic contractions on the effectiveness of advertising and R&amp;D. We tested the hypotheses using a sample of 1,175 U.S. firms across a time span of more than three decades. Our time span includes multiple business cycles, with contractions of different duration and severity, that allow for a more precise test of the moderating role of economic contractions. We find that investments in R&amp;D and advertising pay off in expansions but even more so in contractions. Increasing advertising share in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than increasing advertising share in expansion years. Likewise, sustaining investments in R&amp;D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&amp;D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years.</p><p>We introduce the construct of industry cyclicality to explain differences across industries in advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions, in particular. We argue that different industries are not equally affected by economic downturns and that we need to take this into account to understand advertising effectiveness. We show that the carryover effects of advertising are very dependent on the cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. We also find that across the business cycle, advertising effectiveness is between 50% (market share) and 200% (profit) larger in highly cyclical industries than in industries of average cyclicality, whereas advertising has a small effect at best on firm performance in stable industries. Finally, the effect of industry cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Managerial Implications</head><p>In expansionary years, the higher a firm's advertising or R&amp;D share, the higher its market share and profit. These effects are increased considerably in contractions. To get a sense of the practical magnitude of the effects, we performed two simulation analyses where we consider a "typical" firm in a "typical" industry in an economic expansion versus an economic contraction. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> In our first simulation, we contrasted the performance outcomes of a strategy of increasing advertising share (AS↑ with a strategy of decreasing advertising share (AS↓ . In the former scenario, the firm increases its advertising share by three percentage points per year between years t − 2 and t. In the latter scenario, the firm decreases its advertising share by two percentage points annually over the same period. Our simulation takes interrelations between predictors into account as well as indirect effects of advertising on profit via market share. We find that the difference between AS↑ and AS↓ in expansions amounts to 58 basis points in market share (0.58 percentage points) and $3.33 million in additional profit. These are already meaningful outcomes. However, consistent with the results discussed in §4, in contractions the difference between AS↑ and AS↓ becomes even larger: 65 basis points in market share (12.3% higher than in expansions) and $3.92 million in profit (+17.8%).</p><p>We performed a similar simulation for R&amp;D↑ and R&amp;D↓. The R&amp;D↑ is operationalized as an increase in R&amp;D share by three percentage points per year between years t − 4 and t − 1, whereas R&amp;D↓ refers to a decline in R&amp;D share by two percentage points annually over the same period. We find that in expansions, R&amp;D↑ leads to an increase of 86 basis points in market share and $9.56 million in additional profit by year t versus an increase of 103 basis points and $12.04 million in contractions, a difference of 19.4% and 25.9%, respectively.</p><p>We previously examined the effects of changes in advertising share and R&amp;D share separately, keeping the other marketing instrument constant. However, from a resource allocation standpoint, a firm frequently has to make trade-offs between different investments, including R&amp;D and advertising. This is particularly true during contraction periods when resource constraints become a serious issue. To shed light on this issue, we conducted a third simulation study in which we contrasted the strategy of funding R&amp;D at the expense of advertising (i.e., R&amp;D↑ and advertising↓) with a strategy of funding advertising efforts by reducing R&amp;D (i.e., advertising↑ and R&amp;D↓). Again, we contrast contractions versus expansions. We find that in expansions, R&amp;D↑/advertising↓ leads to an increase of 45 basis points in market share and $5.23 million in additional profit, compared with the strategy of advertising↑/R&amp;D↓. In contractions, R&amp;D↑/advertising↓ leads to an increase of 62 basis in market share and $8.93 million in additional profit, compared with advertising↑/R&amp;D↓. These results suggest that if the firm faces tight resource constraints, a strategy of emphasizing R&amp;D at the expense of advertising generates higher profits and market share than the opposite strategy, and that this effect is more pronounced in contractions than expansions.</p><p>If increasing R&amp;D and advertising share in contractions has such beneficial effects, why is the dominant response of firms to cut back strongly on these activities? Deleersnyder et al. ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) provide an explanation. They argue that firms' marketing decisions remain subject to social influences. They use "information cascades" theory to show that herding behavior-where individuals rely on signals and information conveyed by the behavior of otherscan be rational when gathering information is costly. Herding leads managers to imitate the marketing behavior they observe from or expect of (because of overtime experience) their competitors during contraction and expansion periods. Given the dictum "Better be safe than sorry," potential career sanctions on deviating from others' marketing behavior may induce more managers to decrease advertising and R&amp;D expenditure during tough economic times and to expand expenditure on these activities when most other firms do. As such, they may imitate the heuristics that other firms use <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Deleersnyder et al. 2009</ref>) instead of conducting a formal and independent analysis. This tendency may be further strengthened by the fact that managers remain in their positions for only a few years. This even applies to the CMO, whose average tenure is 23 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Welch 2004)</ref>. Managers may feel that they do not have the "luxury" to take a long-term view.</p><p>Next to behavioral reasons, there may also be "financial" reasons why most firms do not use contractions to increase their advertising or R&amp;D efforts relative to competitors. If a firm has not reserved money in good times for the (inevitable) rainy day, it will have to cut costs no matter what, even if the long-term consequences are decidedly negative. The firms may also feel the pressure to meet the quarterly earnings expectations of Wall Street. Discretionary expenses that can be cut relatively quickly are prime candidates to cut if financial targets are not met otherwise.</p><p>Understanding why firms exhibit cyclical behavior does not make a wrong right. We hope that this study provides ammunition for executives who want to go against the grain. Our findings indicate that a complacent attitude toward the consequences of cutting back on relative R&amp;D or advertising intensity in contractions is not supported by facts. Our simulation results show that the benefits of R&amp;D and advertising are real and may materialize while the executives are in their current jobs, even if it is only three years or so. By including market share in our study, we show marketing managers that herding behavior may not be in their best interest. Our empirical finding that maintaining R&amp;D and advertising share yields greater returns in contractions than in expansions can be used by senior management as motivation to reserve money in good times to be spent in bad times. Furthermore, by including profit in our study, we show senior and financial managers that strongly cutting back on advertising and R&amp;D in contractions reduces rather than improves financial results. The positive net effects of advertising and R&amp;D in contractions on firm profit can be used as an additional reason to counter Wall Street's pressure to meet quarterly expectations, as it provides a view into future profit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>In this study, we focused on aggregate, macrolevel R&amp;D expenditure. We have no microlevel information on the type of R&amp;D activities on which the money is spent and whether the allocation of expenditures on (different subcategories of) NPD-focused R&amp;D versus process-focused R&amp;D projects changes across the business cycle. In contractions, cost cutting and risk aversion are important considerations. This would suggest that in tough times, firms shift R&amp;D resources from product to process innovation, and within product innovations from radically new products to (less risky) incrementally new products. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> However, it is not obvious that firms actually exhibit this behavior. Economists have argued that contractions are good times for developing major innovations because there is less interference with production <ref type="bibr">(Barlevy 2007, Francois and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lloyd-Ellis 2003)</ref>. Moreover, if firms would shift resources in contractions from product to process innovations, one would expect that the contemporaneous effect of R&amp;D on firm profit becomes larger in contractions. We find no evidence for this proposition in our study. Thus, the evidence is inconclusive. Future research should examine whether the mix of R&amp;D projects systematically differs across the business cycle and which type of project is most effective in contractions.</p><p>We need research on whether advertising content changes over the business cycle. It is plausible that in contractions, firms switch funds from differentiation-focused advertising to price-oriented advertising. Because price sensitivity is greater in contractions, it may further stimulate advertising effectiveness; this is exactly what we find. Future research could also investigate whether the effectiveness of other marketing-mix instruments such as price or sales force is systematically affected by adverse economic conditions. Our conceptual framework of specific supply-and demand-side factors is a good starting point for developing hypotheses.</p><p>One might wonder whether the 5% significance level employed in this study is too lenient, given the large number of observations. Although it would obviously be preferable to have even lower p-values, our simulation studies document that our effects are not "merely" statistically significant but also have practical significance. Furthermore, although the power of tests on our main effects is high, this is much less the case for the interactions, which, after all, are the main focus of our study. In a seminal paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McClelland and Judd (1993)</ref> show that a researcher needs about 20 times as many cases in a field study to achieve the same efficiency to detect a two-way interaction as in an optimally designed experiment. Finally, our validation analyses showed that the model with interactions substantially outperforms the benchmark (main-effects-only) model in out-of-sample forecasting.</p><p>In our theorizing, we use supply-and demand-side effects as an organizing framework to predict "net effects" for R&amp;D and advertising (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). However, we do not test the underlying effects per se. Future research could address this limitation. Because information of various demand-and supply-side effects may not be available on a consistent basis for a large number of firms over multiple decades, perhaps a deep case study involving one company, or even one industry, may be the way to implement this idea.</p><p>We study the effects of R&amp;D and advertising on market share, but we do not know whether these changes are due to changes in volume or price, or both. Changes may also be due to changes in a firm's own levels of these instruments or of competitors. Future research could attempt to disentangle these effects. Another limitation of our research is that our simulations do not include competitive reactions. If firms observe other firms making smart moves and increasing market share, they may be tempted to follow suit. On the other hand, the cyclical variation in R&amp;D and advertising has by now been observed for multiple decades. As such, it may be that at least in contractions, marketing myopia will still trump marketing acumen for most firms.</p><p>In sum, much remains to be studied, and we hope that our paper provides an impetus to other marketing researchers to make business cycles the focus of some of their own work. However, the core message of this paper is clear. Economic downturns offer a great opportunity for courageous firms to pull ahead of competitors. To paraphrase former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, you never want a contraction to go to waste.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>effectiveness because of contractions Contraction t × R&amp;D share t 0 0009 (0.0007) 0 0018 (0.0022) Contraction t−1 × R&amp;D share t−1 0 0024 (0.0011) * 0 0079 (0.0025) * * Contraction t−2 × R&amp;D share t−2 0 0024 (0.0012) * 0 0033 (0.0030) Contraction t−3 × R&amp;D share t−* * * p &lt; 0 05; * * p &lt; 0 01 (two-sided).</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">It is possible that in contractions, firms shift resources from radical to incremental innovations, which may offer more revenues in the short term (but less in the long term). However, we are not aware of "hard" evidence to support this proposition. In fact, economists have argued that contractions offer opportunities for firms to work on breakthrough innovations as there is less interference with production(Barlevy 2007, Francois and<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lloyd-Ellis 2003)</ref>. We will revisit this issue in the final section of the paper.5  We thank an anonymous reviewer for this insight.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">In our empirical study, we examined whether industry cyclicality moderated the effectiveness of R&amp;D share. None of the interactions was significant.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Through this operationalization, contr t will always be nonnegative.8  In 13 years of the 35-year period considered in our study, the U.S. economy was growing below its long-term trend, i.e., was in contraction. In the other 22 years, the economy was growing above its long-term trend.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="14">In this illustration, we assume that R&amp;D share remains constant, which allows us to add the coefficients.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="16">The empirical results reported in § §4.1.-4.3 are based on the full sample so as to present the most complete picture of empirical effects, using all observations. However, the parameter estimates based on the estimation sample are very close to the estimates reported in Table3, and the conclusions remained substantively the same.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="18">In our simulations, all other predictors were set at or close to their sample mean. For contraction, we used the median decline of 2.74% for all years. We kept the marketing-mix instrument that is not involved in the simulation in question constant over time.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="19"> See Srinivasan et al. (2009)  for a discussion on the importance of distinguishing between incremental and radically new products in the context of R&amp;D and innovation.</note>
