<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Howard and Sheth (1969)</ref>, the concept of "consideration set" (also referred to as "evoked set" or "choice set" in the literature) has gained considerable acceptance. Consideration set refers to the set of brands (a subset of all the brands in the product category) over which a consumer makes an explicit utility comparison or costbenefit trade-off before she makes her brand choice decision. The notion of consideration set has been rationalized in the literature on the basis of either limited information-processing ability or limited infor-mation acquisition ability on the consumer's part <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Manrai and Andrews 1998)</ref>. The basic idea behind the first rationale is that a consumer has limited information-processing abilities, and hence she cannot make explicit utility comparisons across all the brands (because that will entail her processing attribute information about all the brands). To reduce her processing task, the consumer limits this comparison to a subset of brands that is termed as her consideration set (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nedungadi 1990)</ref>. Note that this explanation implicitly assumes that all the relevant attribute information about all the brands are stored in the PRICE UNCERTAINTY AND CONSUMER SEARCH: A STRUCTURAL MODEL OF CONSIDERATION SET FORMATION consumer's mind; the only issue then is the cost of retrieving and processing this information. In contrast, the limited-information-acquisition-ability rationale for consideration sets involves the notion of consumer uncertainty about the surplus associated with different choice alternatives and, hence, the need for information search (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ratchford 1982, Feinberg and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huber 1996)</ref>. The idea here is that a consumer is uncertain about the attributes of the alternative brands and hence must actively gather information about these brands before making an explicit trade-off to arrive at brand choice. Because information acquisition is a costly and time-consuming process, the consumer approaches the decision-making task in a sequential manner that is described as follows:</p><p>• First, she decides the set of brands about which she will gather more detailed information to get a more precise estimate of the associated consumer surplus.</p><p>• Second, having obtained this information, she decides the utility-maximizing brand based on an explicit trade-off between these considered brands.</p><p>In sharp contrast to this conceptualization of consumer brand choice as a phased decision-making process, prior stochastic choice models, barring a few exceptions that we discuss in §1.2, typically assume that consumers use all the relevant information about all the brands in the product category on all the purchase occasions. Thus, in these models, consumers are assumed to be perfectly informed about the posted prices and other marketing-mix variables of all the brands; furthermore, consumer brand choice decision is arrived at by explicit utility comparison across all the brands in the product category. In addition, because these models take a reduced-form approach, they do not explicate the mechanisms through which point-of-purchase marketing activities, such as feature advertising and display activities, affect consumer brand choice.</p><p>Our objective in this paper is to propose a structural model of consideration set formation, based on the limited-information-acquisition-ability motivation alluded to earlier. If consumers are uncertain about the net utilities associated with the different brands, we need to address the following issues:</p><p>• What are the sources of this uncertainty about consumer surplus associated with the brands?</p><p>• What sources of uncertainty get resolved as a result of consumer information acquisition?</p><p>• What factors might influence the costs associated with information acquisition?</p><p>• What strategies and decision rules do consumers adopt while deciding how much and what type of information to acquire?</p><p>In the context of consumer durables (and other infrequently purchased high-ticket items), consumers can acquire information about the attributes of the different brands through explicit search, for example, through Consumer Reports, consulting experts, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Newman and Staelin 1972)</ref>. This, of course, assumes that the product category in question is a "search good" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nelson 1974)</ref>. However, in the context of frequently purchased products (FPPs), consumers can learn about product quality through consumption experience because these products are more "experience or credence goods" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kotler 1996)</ref>. As such, consumers cannot resolve quality uncertainty by engaging in explicit prepurchase search. Because the FPPs are frequently promoted, consumers do not have complete information about their price: Although they may know the range of possible prices, they do not know the actual posted prices on a particular shopping trip. This leads to uncertainty in consumer surplus associated with the different brands. However, by engaging in explicit price search, consumers can ascertain the posted prices and thereby reduce uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Brief Overview of the Econometric Specification and Main Empirical Findings</head><p>The key components of the proposed specification are as follows. Consumers are uncertain about the prevailing prices of the brands, although they are aware of the price distributions. Consumer rationality implies that consumers will engage in price search to reduce this uncertainty. However, because price search is costly, consumers make a trade-off between higher expected utility from a more extensive price search and the cost of search. In the proposed specification, we conceptualize the costs associated with price search as the "consideration costs" that lead a consumer to sample MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search only a subset of brands in the product category. This subset of sampled brands is conceptualized as the consumer's "consideration set." <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The consideration set formation and the final choices are modeled probabilistically. The optimal consideration set and search costs are endogenously estimated from a scanner panel data set. Also, consumers are uncertain about the quality of the brands in the product category, and they update their beliefs through consumption experiences in a Bayesian fashion. This component of the model draws on the approaches proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jovanovic (1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Miller (1984)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref>.</p><p>Our structural model yields the following insights about the size of the optimal consideration set and consumers' search behavior in FPP categories:</p><p>(i) Relative to consumers with low-price sensitivity, consumers with high-price sensitivity have larger consideration sets.</p><p>(ii) The intensity of consumer search is higher in product categories characterized by greater price variability. Thus, more frequent price promotions with deep discounts lead to large consideration sets.</p><p>We calibrate the proposed model using the ERIM data set for the liquid detergent product category. To analyze cross-category variations in consumer price search behavior, we also calibrate the model using the ketchup data set. Our empirical analysis yields the following key results: <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We recognize that the extant literature mostly deals with outof-store behavior in which consideration sets are linked to brand attributes. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gensch (1987)</ref> posits that consumers may use disjunctive rules ("elimination-by-aspect" heuristics) to limit the number of brands that they evaluate in detail. We agree it is possible that consumers follow more complex screening schemes. At the first stage, they select the subset of brands that meet the minimal criteria on a set of attributes. Let us denote this set as the "acceptance set." It is clear that, on a shopping trip, a consumer does not have any incentive to search for posted prices of brands outside this "acceptance set" (after all, why would I look for price discounts on a brand that I know I would never buy even if it was available for free?). However, if the "acceptance set" is large, a consumer might not consider all the brands in this set on all purchase occasions. Thus, at the second stage, the consumer decides on the "consideration set" based on information search considerations. Thus, we see the attribute-based "elimination-by-aspect" models and the proposed search-based consideration set model as complementary.</p><p>(i) There are significant search costs that consumers incur in discovering the actual posted prices of the brands at the store. This implies that consumers do not consider (i.e., search the posted prices of) all the brands on a shopping trip. For liquid detergents, the estimated baseline search cost is C 0 = 0 0472, and the average consideration set size is 2.31.</p><p>(ii) For the ketchup category, the estimated baseline search cost is C 0 = 0 0284, and the average consideration set size is 2.28. The reason that the consideration set sizes are the same in the two categories despite lower search cost for ketchup is that price variation in the ketchup category is less than price variation in the liquid detergent category. As a result, the expected benefit of search in liquid detergents is more than in the ketchup category. This factor offsets the lower baseline search costs in the ketchup category.</p><p>(iii) Although in-store display activities and feature ads do not influence quality perceptions, they do reduce consumer search costs for a brand, thereby significantly increasing the probability of the brand being considered. We find feature ads to be more effective than displays in influencing consumer search behavior for both liquid detergents and ketchup. Comparing across the two categories, we find feature ads to be relatively more effective in influencing search behavior for liquid detergents. In contrast, we find the impact of displays on the intensity of consumer search to be more for ketchup than for liquid detergents.</p><p>(iv) We find that, for the liquid detergent data set, per capita income significantly increases consumers' search costs. We also find that consumers tend to engage in more extensive price search during weekends than during weekdays.</p><p>(v) Prior consumption experiences influence quality perceptions of the brands for both the liquid detergents and the ketchup categories. However, consumption experiences yield only limited additional quality information. This is consistent with our expectation, because these categories are mature.</p><p>(vi) The consumers' price sensitivity is seriously underestimated if we were to assume that consumers get to know the posted prices of all the brands at a zero cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search</head><p>(vii) We find that models that ignore differences in consumer's intrinsic preference for the various brands seriously overestimate the consideration set sizes. Unlike the proposed model, extant models of consideration set (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews and Srinivasan 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Siddarth et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, and Bronnenberg and Vanhonacker 1996</ref> do not include the brand intercept term in the utilities in the consideration stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Related Literature and Research Contributions</head><p>Some recent studies have attempted to incorporate the notion of consideration or choice sets in the context of stochastic choice models. In a pioneering research effort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hauser and Wernerfelt (1990)</ref> propose a theoretical evaluation cost model of consideration sets. The basic idea here is that consumers face uncertainty about the utilities associated with the various brands and, furthermore, that by engaging in a costly preevaluation search, consumers can resolve (or at least reduce) this uncertainty about brand utilities. Thus, the consumer first decides how many brands to search and then evaluates these brands based on the information gathered at the search stage to make a brand choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roberts and Lattin (1991)</ref> propose the first empirically estimable model of consideration set formation, based on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hauser-Wernerfelt (1990)</ref> framework. The limitation of their econometric specification is that survey data, in addition to scanner panel data, is needed to calibrate the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews and Srinivasan (1995)</ref> extend the <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Roberts-Lattin (1991)</ref> specification to allow for probabilistic consideration sets that makes it possible to calibrate the model using scanner panel data alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bronnenberg and Vanhonacker (1996)</ref> extend the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews and Srinivasan (1995)</ref> framework by incorporating unobserved consumer heterogeneity using latent class approach. They also make an important observation that consideration set composition does not depend on actual posted prices, but on the brands' price range membership. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Siddarth et al. (1995)</ref> develop an alternative reduced-form specification of probabilistic consideration set that entails estimating individuallevel choice sets using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial Logit model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang et al. (1999)</ref> have recently proposed a model that accounts for consumer heterogeneity in consideration sets and in the parameters of the brand choice model.</p><p>The extant econometric models of consideration set formation, being reduced-form specifications, do not explicate the driving force behind consideration. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews and Srinivasan (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bronnenberg and Vanhonacker (1996)</ref> posit that all the brands whose "consideration utility" exceeds a certain threshold form part of the consumer's consideration set and, further, that a brand's "consideration utility" is a function of the marketing-mix variables. Thus, it is not immediately clear as to what consideration really means and why "consideration utility" should be different from "choice utility." Similarly, the specification from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang et al. (1999)</ref> takes a purely combinatorial approach to consideration sets and is not motivated by any behavioral assumption. Although this framework allows for consumer heterogeneity in consideration sets, the consideration set for an individual consumer remains stable throughout her consumption history. However, there is sufficient experimental (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mitra 1995)</ref> and empirical evidence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allenby and Ginter 1995)</ref> to suggest that consideration sets are not stable and are influenced by situational factors.</p><p>Another stream of literature has attempted to incorporate the notion of limited consumer search in a reduced-form approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bucklin and Lattin (1991)</ref> propose a two-state model of consumer brand choice that explicitly models two types of shopping behavior, namely, planned and unplanned purchases. They posit that, for unplanned purchases, consumers are influenced by marketing-mix variables; for planned purchases, consumers do not process instore marketing-mix information and hence are not influenced by point-of-purchase interventions, such as price promotions. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murthi and Srinivasan (1999)</ref> propose a complete-and limited-information model of brand choice and observe that there is considerable evidence that search cost substantially reduces the extent of evaluation of product category information. Note that, in both these models, consumers either engage in searching marketing-mix information about all the brands in the product category or they do not search information on any brand (although Murthi and Srinivasan 1999 allow for consumers to process information on only a limited set of marketing-mix variables).</p><p>We view our main methodological contribution as being the integration of these two research streams. The proposed model of consideration sets is developed taking the limited-information-acquisitionability perspective. The notion of limited-price search is central to our conceptualization of consideration set formation. Derived from the primitives of consumer utility maximization, our formulation also provides insights into variation in consumer search behavior across product categories in terms of consumer characteristics (e.g., price sensitivity) and firms' behavior (e.g., price promotion policy).</p><p>The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. In §2, we develop the model formulation. Section 3 describes the data set used for calibrating the proposed model, discusses the estimation method, reports the parameter estimates, and discusses the managerial implications of our findings. Section 4 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model Development</head><p>In this section, we lay out the model specification and discuss the main assumptions underlying the proposed formulation. Before developing the econometric specification, in §2.1 we provide a conceptual description of the model. Section 2.2 lays out the mathematical details underlying the proposed specification. 2 Section 2.3 discusses our approach to control for unobserved consumer heterogeneity. Section 2.4 discusses the necessity for explicitly modeling consumer quality learning to derive an identifiable statistical model of consideration set formation. Finally, §2.5 provides insights into some of the key determinants of the extent of consumer price search (and consequently the size of the optimal consideration set). Specifically, we provide the comparative statics results for the size of the consideration set with respect to (i) consumer price sensitivity and (ii) variability of prices.</p><p>2 Analytical details are more elaborately discussed in the Technical Appendix that is available from http://mktsci.pubs@informs.org.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Conceptual Description</head><p>The basic ingredients of the proposed model of consideration set formation are as follows:</p><p>(i) At the beginning of her consumption history, a consumer is uncertain about the intrinsic quality (and hence the associated utility) of the brands in the product category; this initial quality of uncertainty is captured by hypothesizing that the consumer has prior beliefs about the quality of the brands in the product category.</p><p>(ii) The consumer learns about the intrinsic quality of the brands in the product category through consumption experiences. Consumption experience does not fully reveal the intrinsic brand qualities. Thus, consumption experience only provides a noisy signal about the brand's intrinsic quality. Section 2.2.1 describes the Bayesian updating mechanism underlying the evolution of quality perceptions over a consumer's purchase history. Note that whereas brand qualities are uncertain and evolve over time, we assume that consumers cannot learn additionally about quality of the various brands while at the store through any conscious search/information acquisition effort.</p><p>(iii) Because the brands in the product category are occasionally on "sale," and because the depth of discount offered during price promotions varies across sale events, a consumer is uncertain about the posted price of the brands on any purchase occasion. However, we assume that through prior observation, the consumer is aware of the distribution of prices for the various brands that are assumed to be stationary. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> (iv) Before making her brand choice decision, the consumer can ascertain the posted prices of all the brands in the category or a subset thereof. However, this price search is costly to the consumer because it entails investment in time and effort. This implies that while deciding the number of brands to search on a given purchase occasion, a utility-maximizing consumer makes a trade-off between the potential gains from searching an incremental brand and the associated search costs. Thus, in the proposed formulation, MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search "consideration" is conceptualized as the process of price search and "consideration set" refers to the optimal subset of brands whose prices the consumer selects to search. Section 2.2.2 provides the analytical details of the consumer trade-off and the process of optimal consideration set formation.</p><p>(v) Given her consideration set, the consumer observes the posted prices of the included brands. The consumer then selects the brand that offers the highest expected consumer surplus. (Note that whereas the price uncertainty gets resolved as a result of price search, the consumer continues to remain uncertain about the intrinsic brand qualities at the brand choice stage.) Section 2.2.3 derives the brand choice probabilities based on the random utility-maximization paradigm (McFadden 1981).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model Formulation</head><p>2.2.1. Utility Specification and Evolution of Quality Perceptions. Consider a product category with j = 1 J brands. We assume that consumer i's (indirect) utility or surplus from brand j on purchase occasion t can be approximated as a linear function of brand j's perceived quality, q ijt , and price, p ijt , as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U ijt = q ijt − p ijt (1)</formula><p>The parameter denotes the consumer's intensity of preference for quality (alternatively, her marginal willingness to pay for quality). The above specification for the indirect utility can be derived from a direct utility specification called the "cross-product repackaging utility." 4 Such a specification has been used by <ref type="bibr">Blattberg and Wisniewski (1989)</ref> to explain asymmetric switching between brands and has been traditionally employed in the vertical differentiation literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Moorthy 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bagwell and Riordan 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Kalra et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Villas-Boas 1998</ref>.</p><p>We assume further that consumers are uncertain about the intrinsic qualities of the competing brands. This is modeled by positing that consumer i on any purchase occasion t, instead of being aware of the "true" quality of brand j, holds only subjective quality beliefs that are captured by her priors f q ijt . In particular, we assume a normal distribution for consumer prior beliefs, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q ij t H i t ∼ N ij t 2 ijt ∀i ∀j (2)</formula><p>Note that ij t denotes consumer i's current estimate of the expected quality of brand j given her consumption history, H i t . 2</p><p>ijt denotes the extent of consumer uncertainty about brand j's quality on purchase occasion t.</p><p>We assume that prior to any consumption experience in the product category (i.e., at purchase occasion t= 0), the consumer holds identical quality beliefs about all the brands in the product category. This belief is assumed to be identical across all consumers. Thus, we assume that initial quality beliefs are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q ij t H i t = 0 ∼ N 0 2 0 ∀i ∀j 5 (3)</formula><p>We assume that a consumer learns about the intrinsic quality of a brand through consumption experiences. We assume further that consumption experience provides only partial information about the brand's intrinsic quality. In other words, consumption experience is only a noisy signal of a brand's intrinsic quality. The rationale for this assumption is as follows. First, the noise in consumption experience could arise because of "inherent product variability" <ref type="bibr">Urban 1988, Moorthy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Srinivasan 1995)</ref>; i.e., the delivered quality of a brand fluctuates about its intrinsic quality. Second, consumers may misjudge the quality realization for the brand on a particular consumption occasion. Third, the consumers might even forget about the qualities of the brands they had learned during the previous consumption experiences. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The net impact of this assumption is that whereas a consumer's uncertainty MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search about a brand's quality reduces over her consumption history, the "true" quality of a brand does not get fully revealed <ref type="bibr">(Erdem and Keane 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">q ij t−1 ∼ N ij t−1 2 ij t−1</formula><p>be the ith consumer's perceived quality of brand j on purchase occasion t − 1. Further, let ij t−1 denote the (noisy) quality cue associated with consumption experience on t −1 occasion with ij t−1 = q j + ij t−1 (4)</p><p>In Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), q j denotes the "true" quality of brand j, whereas the random variable ij t−1 denotes the noise associated with consumption experience with ij t−1 ∼ N 0 2 . 8 Thus, by consuming brand j in period t − 1 the consumer gets to learn more about the "true" quality of the brand. However, because the signal is noisy, her expectation about brand j's quality, ij t−1 , does not get updated to q j . Note that 2 is a measure of the informativeness of consumption experience: 2 = 0 corresponds to the product category being a classic experience goods so that the consumer gets to learn the "true" quality after a single consumption experience <ref type="bibr">(Nelson 1974, Milgrom and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Roberts 1986)</ref>. For analytical tractability, we assume the variance of the noise term, 2 , to be the same across all the brands and over time.</p><p>We assume that the consumer uses the realized value of the consumption signal,ˆ ij t−1 , to update her prior beliefs about brand j's quality, q ij t−1 , in a Bayesian manner. Let d ij t−1 be an indicator variable such that d ij t−1 = 1 if consumer i purchases brand j on purchase occasion t − 1. Using the fact that normal density is self-conjugate (DeGroot 1970), the mean and variance of the posterior beliefs are related to the mean and variance of the prior beliefs as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ij t = ij t−1 ij t−1 + d ij t−1ˆ ij t−1 ij t−1 + d ij t−1 and ij t = ij t−1 + d ij t−1</formula><p>(5)</p><p>In Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), we use ij t−1 = 2 / 2 ij t−1 . <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We can interpret ij t as the inverse of signal-to-noise ratio for brand j's consumption experience. It measures the extent to which the uncertainty of a consumer exposed to successive t − 1 consumption experiences differs from the "inherent product variability." In particular, a high value of i t would suggest that additional consumption experiences are not very effective in further influencing her quality perception of brand j.</p><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) characterizes the law of motion of the mean of consumer i's subjective quality beliefs about brand j as she receives the consumption signals of brand j. As shown in the Technical Appendix, the mean of the consumer's quality beliefs converges to the true quality q j ; i.e., ij t → q j as t → . It is important to note that although the consumer observes the realizations of consumption signals ˆ ij s t−1 s=1 (and hence knows deterministically the values of ij t for all brands j at any time t , the analyst does not. In the absence of observations on ˆ ij s t−1 s=1 , from the analyst's perspective, ij t is a normal random variable that we denote by˜ ij t . Hence, the analyst can only make probabilistic statements about the consumer's consideration set and brand choice decisions. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> To help better understand the asymmetry in the information sets of the consumer and the analyst, we graphically represent the sequence of events in Figure 1.

These restrictions on the error space are discussed in detail in the Technical Appendix. Also, note that the second term in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) subsequently denoted compactly as N ij t−1 , is a normal random variable that can take both positive and negative values. Thus, as in <ref type="bibr">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref>, the proposed specification allows a very flexible quality-learning mechanism in which individual consumption experiences can have both favorable and unfavorable impacts on quality perception. This is distinct from the reduced-form operationalizations of "purchase-event feedback" or brand loyalty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Guadagni and Little 1983</ref>) that allows for only positive (or negative as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Seetharaman et al. 1999</ref>) updating of quality perceptions over successive consumption experiences. Note that the <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Guadagni and Little (1983)</ref> loyalty term allows for the loyalty to a brand to fall if the brand is not consumed. But, if the brand is consumed, then the loyalty of the brand will always increase (or always decrease depending on the sign of the loyalty coefficient). On the other hand, in the Bayesian updating model, the preference of the brand can increase, decrease, or stay the same when the brand is purchased (the increase or decrease depends on the magnitude of the noisy quality signal received from consumption).</p><p>We assume the initial values of ij t and ij t to be the same across all brands and across all consumers and without loss of generality set it to zero; i.e., MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search ij 0 = 0 and ij 0 = 0 , ∀i ∀j. Thus, from Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), the analyst's evaluation of consumer i's mean quality perception of brand j given her purchase history H i t , is given by˜ ij t = N ij t−1 + t−2 l=0 Truncated N ij l . We reiterate that the mean quality perception of brand j, ij t -being a sum of the realized values of t random variables--is not a random variable from the consumer's perspective, because she gets to observe these realized values of the consumption signals, namely, ij t−1 , ∀t. However, from the perspective of the analyst,˜ ij t is a random variable that captures that part of the consumer's preference that is unobservable and time varying. 11 This is analogous to the "random error component" in reduced-form specifications, such as Logit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Guadagni and Little 1983)</ref> or Probit (e.g., Chintagunta 1993) models. Another implication of Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is that the random error component exhibits serial correlation, i.e., "habit persistence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Roy et al. 1996)</ref>. Furthermore, because the variance of˜ ij t evolves over time, it is heteroskedastic as well.</p><p>In short, the proposed quality-evolution specification provides an intuitive interpretation of the "statistical error term" in the reduced-form choice models. It raises questions about the standard assumptions of homoskedasticity and absence of serial correlation routinely made in the literature.

Although we can introduce the additional error term assuming a known variance, as in <ref type="bibr">Erdem and Keane (1996)</ref>, it leads to estimation complexity without yielding any additional insights from the model. are denoted by q ij t ∼ N ij t 2 ij t , ∀j. In addition to quality uncertainty, the consumer faces uncertainty about the posted prices of the various brands on that purchase occasion. The basic idea here is that because retailers routinely offer price promotions of varying depths of discount, the actual price prevailing on any shopping trip is a random variable. Although the consumer does not know the actual posted price, we assume that she is aware of price distributions for the various brands denoted by p ijt ∼ f j p j 2 p j , ∀j, wherē p j is the mean or expected price and 2 p j is the variability in brand j's price. Note that 2 p j increases with the frequency of price promotions and the depths of discount offered when brand j is on "sale." To ensure that the net surplus or (indirect) utility function U ij t has a Type 1 extreme value (EV) distribution, we assume that the price of brand j has a Type 1 EV distribution. We further assume that the price distributions are stationary and do not change with time. These assumptions are needed to ensure a closedform expression for the expected maximum utilities given in Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) later.</p><p>Given the twofold uncertainty on both the intrinsic quality as well as the prevailing price, consumer surplus associated with brand j, U ijt = q ijt − p ijt , is a random variable with mean ij t − p ij t . In particular, the expected (indirect) utility associated with brand j, prior to the consumer discovering the actual posted price, p ij t , is a random EV variable with mean ij t − p ij t and variance 2 uj = 2 pj ; i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">U ij t ∼ EV √ 6 uj √ 6 u e c − ij t +p j (7)</formula><p>where e c is the Euler's constant. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Although the consumer cannot further reduce uncertainty surrounding brand j's quality during the shopping trip, she recognizes that she can ascertain the actual posted prices (and thereby eliminate price uncertainty) by engaging in search. Now, if price search was costless, the consumer's optimal decision would be to search the posted prices of all the brands in the product category. Then, having ascertained the actual posted prices, she would choose the brand that MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search yields the highest expected surplus. (Note that, even after the consumer has ascertained the posted prices, she still faces uncertainty about the net utility derivable from a brand because of quality uncertainty.) However, if searching for the posted prices involves costs, then searching for the posted prices of all the brands in the product category may not be an optimal decision. In the proposed specification, the process of price search is conceptualized as "brand consideration" so that the notion of "consideration set" is synonymous with the set of brands whose prices the consumer actually samples on that purchase occasion.</p><p>This raises the question: How does the consumer decide how many and which brands to consider on any given occasion? In this paper, we assume that the consumer's optimal consideration decision is based on expected utility maximization and arrived at by making explicit trade-off between the costs and benefits from price search. Let C ij t be the search cost that consumer i has to incur if she were to search the posted price of brand j on purchase occasion t, given her consumption history, H i t . The decision on the optimal size and composition of her consideration set would involve a trade-off between the benefit from including an additional brand j and the additional cost C ij t that she has to incur. Thus, the consumer selects those brands in her consideration set that yield the highest net expected surplus (net of the total search cost).</p><p>To derive the probability that any given set of brands, denoted by {k}, constitutes the consumer's optimal consideration set, we need to compute the expected (indirect) utility associated with this set and the total cost of searching for the posted prices of the brands in the set. We need to do this computation for all possible sets of brand {j}. Note that the expected (indirect) utility associated with any set {j} is the same as the expected (indirect) utility of the "best" brand in that set. Clearly, because quality perceptions evolve over the consumer's purchase history, the evaluation also changes over successive purchase occasions. Now, the maximum of a set of EV random variables is also an EV random variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Johnson and Kotz 1974)</ref>. To get a closed-form expression for the expected utility of the "best" brand in the consideration set, we assume that the variance of price dis-tribution 2 p j is the same across all the brands in the product category. The net impact of this assumption is that the variance of the (indirect) utility function, U ij t , in Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is the same across all the brands and remains constant over a consumer's purchase history; i.e., 2 ujt = 2 u = 2 p , ∀i ∀j ∀t. 14 Consider, hypothetically, the consumer selecting brands 1 to N with N ≤ J in her consideration set. It can be shown that the expected benefit (net of search cost) of including brands 1 to N in the consideration set {j} is given by 15</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">EB j i t = √ 6 u ln N l=1 exp √ 6 u il t −p j − N l=1 C il t (8)</formula><p>Note that the expected benefit in equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is concave in N , the number of brands in the consideration set.

However, we will not have a closed-form expression for consideration probability [Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)] that greatly simplifies the estimation. In the context of our empirical analysis for the liquid detergent category, we find the variance of the prices to be almost the same across the four brands (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1a</ref>). In fact, as pointed out by the area editor, we can demonstrate this using a simple F -test on the variances of the different brands. As a result, we have used Equation (8) to compute the expected benefit for liquid detergents. In contrast, for the ketchup data set, the price variances are not similar (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1b</ref>), and hence we have numerically computed the expected benefit to compute consideration probabilities. realized values of the quality cues). As such, given the consumer's consumption history at time t, H i t , we can only write the probability that the set {k} is the optimal consideration set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Pr k = Consideration Set = Pr √ 6 u ln l∈ k exp √ 6 u ˜ il t −p l − l∈ k C il t ≥ √ 6 u ln l∈ j exp √ 6 u ˜ il t −p l − l∈ j C il t ∀ j (10) 2.2.3. Consumer Brand Choice Decision.</formula><p>Once the consumer has selected her optimal consideration set, {k}, she gets to observe the posted prices of all the brands included in her consideration set. That is, prior to the consumer making a brand choice, the price uncertainty gets completely resolved for all the brands under consideration. However, she still remains uncertain about the intrinsic qualities of these brands. She then selects the brand in her consideration set that gives her the highest expected (indirect) utility. As before, because˜ ij t s are random variables from the analyst's perspective, the analyst can only make a probabilistic statement about the optimal chosen brand. In particular, because˜ ij t s are truncated normal random variables [compare Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)], <ref type="bibr">16</ref> the probability that the consumer selects brand j, given that j ∈ k , is given by a Probit probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pr ij t = 1 j ∈ k = Pr ˜ ij t − p ij t ≥ ˜ ih t − p ih t ∀h ∈ k H i t = p 1 ij t / − • • • p N ij t / − Truncated ˜ 1 ij t • • • ˜ j−1 ij t ˜ j+1 ij t • • • ˜ N ij t × h∈ k h =j d˜ h ij t (<label>11</label></formula><p>) <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In addition to the restrictions imposed because of the consumer's sequence of past choices, the variables˜ ij t also need to satisfy restrictions because brand j belongs to the optimal consideration set {k}.

Controlling for Unobserved Consumer Heterogeneity In the proposed formulation, because different consumers go through idiosyncratic consumption experiences, the quality evaluations are not the same across all consumers (as well as not the same across all the brands for the same consumer). In effect, this heterogeneity in quality beliefs corresponds to a richer specification of intercept heterogeneity than that in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chintagunta et al. 1991, Gonul and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Srinivasan 1993)</ref> as it allows for:</p><p>• Unobserved heterogeneity in intrinsic brand preference across consumers.</p><p>• Unobserved heterogeneity in intrinsic brand preference across purchase occasions for the same consumer.</p><p>We are able to accomplish this finer variance decomposition, because ijt needs to satisfy certain conditions over the consumption history H i t that are discussed in detail in the Technical Appendix.</p><p>To account for heterogeneity in the consumer's intensity of preference (marginal willingness to pay) for quality, we assume to be gamma distributed across the consumer population with mean and variance 2 . This ensures that the consumer's marginal willingness to pay for quality is positive, consistent with the vertical differentiation literature. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search</p></div>

Specifically, we would not be able to identify separately the baseline search cost C 0 (the component of search cost that is not time varying) and the true qualities of the brands q j .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Determinants of the Size of the Optimal</head><p>Consideration Set An insight that we obtain from the model regarding the size of the optimal consideration set is summarized in the following proposition: Proposition 1. The higher the variance of (indirect) utility, the larger is the size of the optimal consideration set.</p><p>An immediate implication of Proposition 1 is that if consumers in a product market exhibit higher price sensitivity, they will search the prevailing prices of more brands (i.e., will have larger consideration sets) before making a brand choice. This makes intuitive sense because higher price sensitivity implies that consumers will attach greater importance to discovering lower prices and hence will exhibit higher search propensity. As such, the intensity of competition in these markets will be higher. We summarize this discussion in the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 1. In product categories, where consumers have lower intensity of preference for quality (equivalently, higher price sensitivity), the size of the optimal consideration set would be larger compared with product categories with lower consumer price sensitivity. Further, a consumer with higher price sensitivity would tend to search the posted prices of a larger number of brands before making a brand choice decision.</p><p>Another implication of Proposition 1 is that if price variability is high, either because of frequent promotions or deep discounts offered on promotions, the incentive to engage in price search will be high. As such, the average size of the consideration set will be large. This has important managerial implications concerning the long-term impact of price promotions. This result demonstrates that a greater reliance on price promotions by firms induces more active price search by the consumers. That, in turn, would mean more intense price competition in the future. We summarize this intuition in the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 2. The greater the price variability in a product category, the greater will be the size of the optimal consideration set. Thus, in product categories where promotions are frequent and are of sizable depth, consumers will actively search across brands for low prices. In contrast, in product categories where promotions are infrequent or with shallow discounts, consumers tend to repeat buy a brand out of inertia or consumer "lock-ins."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data and Variable Definition</head><p>For model calibration and detailed analysis, we use the ERIM data set for liquid detergents. We have taken four national brands for the analysis: Wisk ® , Tide, Era ® , and Surf ® . These four brands account for a total of 81% of the market share in this product category. The data set comprises a random sample of 400 households with purchase observations extending from the 25th week of 1986 to the 34th week of 1988. The minimum number of purchase observations for a household was 12; the maximum was 81, with the mean being 21 purchases. We randomly picked 200 households for the purpose of parameter estimation; the other 200 households form the holdout sample to test the predictive validity of the proposed and competing specifications. The estimation sample had a total of 3,592 purchase observations, and the holdout sample had a total of 3,019 purchase observations. In both the estimation and the holdout samples, we take the first five observations for each household to initialize consumers' prior beliefs about the qualities of these brands and the store familiarity variable for the consumers. The summary statistics for the entire sample of 400 households are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1a</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we do a cross-category analysis using the ketchup data set. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> For our analysis, we have taken four brands: Heinz, Hunt's, Del Monte ® , and the generic brand. The data set is comprised of 150 randomly selected households with a total of 2,332 observations. The minimum number of purchase observations for a household was 7; the maximum was 62, with the mean being 16 purchases. We use the first five observations to initialize the consumers' prior quality beliefs and the store familiarity variable. Similar to the liquid detergent category, we picked out 100 random households with a total of 1,532 observations to test the predictive validity of the proposed and competing specifications. The summary statistics for the data set are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1b</ref>.</p><p>In the preestimation sample, we assume that consumers have the same quality beliefs for all the brands at the beginning of their purchase histories. In other words, we assume the initial values of the expected MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search quality beliefs to be the same across all brands and across all consumers and without loss of generality set this belief to zero, i.e., ij 0 = 0 ∀i ∀j. We then calibrate the model for the preestimation sample and calculate the posterior quality beliefs for all the brands and for every consumer at the end of their fifth purchase occasion. We then take these posterior quality beliefs as the initial prior beliefs for the estimation sample. The posterior quality beliefs for the liquid detergent data set are given in Table <ref type="table">TA</ref>.1 of the Technical Appendix and for the ketchup data set in Table <ref type="table">TA</ref>.2 of the Technical Appendix.</p><p>Factors Affecting Cost of Price Search. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The cost of searching the posted price of a brand (C ij t is the cost incurred by a consumer to ascertain the actual price of a brand on a given purchase occasion. The greater the time spent to do so, the higher will be the consumer's search cost. Similarly, the higher the consumer's opportunity cost of time, the higher will be her search cost.</p><p>We posit that consumer i's costs associated with searching the posted price of brand j on purchase occasion t depend on:</p><p>(i) Whether the brand is on display on that purchase occasion;</p><p>(ii) Whether the brand is feature advertised on that purchase occasion;</p><p>(iii) Whether the consumer is familiar with the store environment;</p><p>(iv) Whether the purchase occurs on a weekday or a weekend;</p><p>(v) Whether there is a full-time homemaker in the household;</p><p>(vi) Whether the per capita household income is high or low; and, (vii) Whether the brand was on display on the previous purchase occasion.</p><p>Thus, we assume that the search cost incurred by consumer i in including brand j in her consideration set on purchase occasion t is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">C ij t = C 0 + C 1 × DISPLAY ijt + C 2 × FEATURE ijt + C 3 × ST LOY i + C 4 × DOW it + C 5 × FTHM i + C 6 × INCOME i + C 7 × DISPLAY ij t−1 (15)</formula><p>In Equation ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), DISPLAY ij t = 1 if brand j is displayed on purchase occasion t and = 0 otherwise. The indicator variable FEATURE ij t is similarly defined. Because displays and feature ads give price information (Blattberg and Neslin 1990), they automatically reduce price search costs to zero. 20 However, we would not expect every consumer to observe displays and feature ads. Because we do not have the secondary data regarding the information a given individual shopper would acquire from a feature ad or a display, we must model each consumer as being exposed to the stimuli. Thus, at the aggregate level, we would only expect the search costs for ascertaining a brand's posted price to reduce by a certain fraction (and not to zero) in the presence of feature ads or displays.</p><p>The time spent by a consumer to ascertain the posted price of a brand would also depend on the consumer's familiarity with its shelf location. In Equation (15), we capture the consumer's familiarity with the shelf location of the brands through two variables, namely, ST LOY i and DISPLAY ij t−1 . The variable ST LOY i captures the store and category familiarity effects: The more familiar the consumer is with the store layout and the category shelf arrangement, the less time consuming is the price search process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Desai and Hoyer 2000)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murthi and Srinivasan (1999)</ref>, store and category familiarity is defined as the fraction of dollars spent in the product category in the store in the initialization period. We believe that this is a much better way of capturing store and category familiarity than defining two separate variables for store and category familiarity. DISPLAY ij t−1 is a dummy variable that indicates whether brand j was on display on previous purchase occasion t-1. The argument here is that because displays are usually placed in special locations, if on the previous purchase occasion the brand was on display, search for the brand will be more costly if it is not again displayed in the current period.</p><p>We capture the impact of opportunity cost of time on search costs through three variables, namely, DOW it , FTHM i , and INCOME i . DOW it is an indicator variable such that DOW it = 1 if consumer i undertakes the tth purchase during a weekend and is zero if the purchase was made during a weekday. It captures the shopping time available to the consumer. On weekends, because working households have more time available for shopping, we would expect them to engage in more extensive price search due to a lower opportunity cost of time. FTHM i is an indicator variable such that FTHM i = 1 if household i has a full-time homemaker and FTHM i = 0 otherwise. We would expect the presence of a full-time homemaker to reduce the household's opportunity cost of time and hence to reduce price search costs. INCOME i is defined as the per capita household income and is measured in dollars. The argument here is that a highincome consumer would have a higher opportunity cost of time and hence a higher search cost for comparing prices across brands in a product category.</p><p>Based on the above discussion, we would expect the signs of the parameters to be: 21 C 0 &gt; 0; C 1 &lt; 0 C 2 &lt; 0; C 3 &lt; 0; C 4 &lt; 0; C 5 &lt; 0; C 6 &gt; 0 and C 7 &gt; 0.</p></div>

In fact, we find that for the holdout sample Models II, AS (1995), and BV (1996) predict brand choice quite poorly.

We summarize our discussion under five broad substantive issues:</p><p>Perceived Quality Positioning of the Competing Brands. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we find the estimated mean perceived quality of Wisk, Tide, Era, and Surf to be 0.0097, 0.1729, 0.1135, and 0.0589, respectively. The fact that Wisk has the lowest perceived quality is somewhat surprising because it happens to be the MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search market share leader (31% share). This is because of the following two reasons: First, the average price of Wisk is the lowest among all the brands. Secondly, the average consideration set size when consumers buy Wisk is 2.21, which is significantly lower than the average consideration set size when consumers purchase other brands (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). Also, when consumers buy Wisk, their consideration set is of size one 32% of the time. On the other hand, when consumers buy brands other than Wisk, their consideration set size is of size one 20-25% of the time (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). It thus appears that many consumers buy Wisk out of inertia and that their purchase decision is not influenced by competitive promotions simply because they fail to notice the prices of the other brands. This is also consistent with the fact that Wisk is the most feature-advertised (frequency of feature ads = 0.14) and displayed (frequency of displays = 0.22) brand, and hence consumers incur much lower search costs for Wisk compared with other brands. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Consumer Learning and the Effectiveness of Quality Cues. The estimate of 0 -the initial value of precision of quality beliefs-is 2.6758 (assumed to be the same across all consumers and across all brands). Recall that a high value of 0 suggests a low variance in subjective quality beliefs held by the consumers at the beginning of their consumption histories. Thus, a value of 0 implies that the extent of quality learning that can occur through consumption experience is low. Our estimate of 0 suggests a moderate extent of quality learning happening in the product category. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the evolution of quality beliefs of the consumers across 15 purchase occasions. We can see that there is still a substantial amount of quality learning going on even after 15 consumption experiences. For Model II, the estimate of 0 is 1.4008. This suggests that, if we ignore consideration effects, we may overestimate the extent of quality learning happening in a product category. This makes sense because if we ignore heterogeneity in consideration set sizes (across consumers and over purchase occasions), all the variance is attributed to heterogeneity in subjective quality beliefs, thereby magnifying consumer-learning effects. As noted in §2.3, heterogeneity in subjective quality beliefs in the proposed specification is akin to intercept heterogeneity in the reduced-form specifications such as the Logit model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chintagunta et al. 1991)</ref>. Thus, we conclude that ignoring consideration effects may lead to overestimation of consumer heterogeneity, thereby confirming the conclusions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang et al. (1999)</ref>.</p><p>Recall that to ensure comparability of Models I and II, in Model II we allow displays and feature ads to affect intrinsic brand preferences (as in <ref type="bibr">Erdem and Keane 1996)</ref>. This is captured by f (the ratio of the noise-in-consumption signal to noise in the feature ad) and by d (the ratio of the noise-in-consumption signal to noise-in-display signal), respectively. High values of f and d imply that feature ads and displays have a strong impact on intrinsic preference. The parameter estimates of d = 0 041 and f = 0.062 suggest almost no impact of feature ads and displays on quality beliefs. This is expected because feature ads and displays primarily give price information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blattberg and Neslin 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Quality-Price Trade-off and Consumer Price Sensitivity. The estimates of the mean quality sensitivity parameter, , for Model I and Model II are 2.4168 and 4.7522, respectively. This suggests that ignoring consideration effects might lead to underestimation of price sensitivity (high-quality sensitivity or a high marginal willingness to pay for quality is synonymous with low-price sensitivity). This makes sense MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search because in Model II we assume that a consumer observes the prices of all the brands and hence whenever any brand is on sale, the consumer notices such sales promotion and responds to it. In contrast, Model I explicitly recognizes that consumers may not be aware of the posted prices of all the brands, and hence a nonresponse to ongoing price promotion need not necessarily imply low-price sensitivity. These insights are further reinforced by comparing the price elasticities implied by Models I and II (Tables <ref type="table">5a-5c</ref>). As expected, we find that the con- *Refers to the marginal impact of price change on brand choice probability, conditional on the fact that the brand is included in the consideration set. ditional price elasticities (conditional on consideration) are greater for Model I than price elasticities for Model II. However, we cannot make a general statement about the unconditional price elasticites for Model I. In particular, we note that the unconditional price elasticities from Model I are higher than the price elasticities from Model II only for the high market share brands (namely, Wisk and Tide). In contrast, the unconditional price elasticities for Model I are lower than the price elasticities for Model II for the low market share brands (namely, Era and Surf). <ref type="bibr">27</ref> For the model AS (1995), the estimated price sensitivity in the consideration stage is statistically insignificant. This suggests that posted prices may not have any appreciable impact on consideration probability. This finding supports the contention of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bronnenberg and Vanhonacker (1996)</ref> that it is the price range membership (high-price vs. low-price tier) rather than the actual posted prices that determine consideration set composition. The estimates of the variance of quality sensitivity, 2 , from Model I and Model II are 0.4251 and 1.219, respectively. This again highlights the fact that ignoring heterogeneity in consideration sets may lead to overestimation of consumer heterogeneity as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang et al. (1999)</ref>.</p><p>Determinants of the Costs of Price Search. The estimate for the baseline search cost C 0 is 0.0472. Thus, the average size of the consideration set is 2.30 in the absence of any marketing activity for a consumer with no store familiarity and who comes from a household with per capita income of $10,000 and with no full-time homemaker. Such a consumer considers only one brand during 23.4% of the purchase occasions, two brands during 32% of the purchase occasions, three brands during 35.3% of the purchase occasions, and four brands for the rest (9.1%) of the occasions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>). This implies that a consumer is likely to buy a brand repeatedly out of inertia, and not from actively comparing the prices of all brands in this product category.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> also summarizes the marginal impact of feature ads and displays on the average size of the consideration set. The reduction in search cost due to display, C 1 , is −0 0091. Thus, if all the brands were on display, the average size of consideration set increases  (By assumption) * Baseline search cost when there is no feature ad and no display for a consumer with store-category familiarity = 0; purchase is made on a weekday; per capita household income = $10 000; full-time homemaker = 0. from 2.30 to 2.50 (the increase is statistically significant at p &lt; 0 01). The reduction in search cost due to feature advertisements, C 2 , is −0 0197. If all the brands were to be feature advertised, then the average size of consideration set increases from the baseline case of 2.30 to 2.75 (the increase is statistically significant at p &lt; 0 01). This suggests that displays are not as effective as feature ads in influencing search behavior. This is an interesting finding: In this product category, except for Era, the other three brands (namely, Wisk, Tide, and Surf) seem to rely more heavily on in-store display than feature ads. This suggests that these brands need to rethink their promotional mix (unless otherwise justified by cost considerations).</p><p>The reduction in search cost due to store familiarity, C 3 , is −0 002 and is not significant even at = 20%. The reduction in search cost during shopping trips on weekends compared with those during weekdays, C 4 , is −0 0032 and is significant at = 10%. Thus, the average size of consideration set during weekends is 2.34 and during the weekdays it is 2.30, thus suggesting a very modest impact of day of the week (DOW) on search behavior. This conforms to our expectation that consumers engage in more extensive price search MEHTA, RAJIV, AND SRINIVASAN Price Uncertainty and Consumer Search during weekends because they have more time available for shopping (low opportunity cost of time).</p><p>Income has a significant impact on search costs. The increase in search cost for every $1,000 increase in per capita household income, C 6 , is 0.0018. In the data set, per capita household income varies from $1,000 to $33,000. Thus, the average consideration set size for a household with per capita income of $10,000 is 2.30. The average consideration set size corresponding to per capita income of $20,000 and $30,000 are 1.99 and 1.83, respectively (the decrease in the average set size is statistically significant at p &lt; 0 01). This shows that the intensity of price search decreases with income.</p><p>The increase in search cost due to previous display, C 7 , is 0.0009 and is not significant even at = 20%. Thus, previous displays do not significantly impact the costs of search during the current purchase occasion.</p><p>Consumer Search Behavior. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports the frequency of the consideration set sizes for the proposed model when each of the four brands (namely, Wisk, Tide, Era, and Surf) is chosen. We observe that the average size of the consideration set when Wisk was bought is 2.21; for Tide the average size is 2.42; for Era the average size is 2.27; and for Surf the average size is 2.35. Thus, it appears that despite its lower perceived quality, Wisk enjoys market share leadership primarily because a relatively high fraction of consumers who buy Wisk do not consider other brands.</p><p>Overall, we find that, in the liquid detergents category consumers consider one brand 26.2% of the time, two brands 28.7% of the time, three brands around 33.1% of the time, and four brands the rest (12)% of the time. This corresponds to an average consideration set size of 2.31. This indicates moderate intensity of price search in the product category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> compares the set-size probabilities predicted by the proposed model and the competing models: AS (1995), <ref type="bibr">SBM (1995), and</ref><ref type="bibr">BV (1996)</ref>. The average consideration set size for AS (1995), <ref type="bibr">SBM (1995), and</ref><ref type="bibr">BV (1996)</ref> are 2.494, 2.564, and 2.585, respectively. We observe that the proposed model predicts a statistically significantly smaller consideration set. The reason we get lower consideration set size is as follows. The models proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews and Srinivasan (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Siddarth et al. (1995)</ref>, and Bronnenberg and Vanhonacker (1996) ignore the brand intercept term in the consideration stage. This is because in their reducedform formulations, brand intercept is not separately identifiable. If we include intrinsic brand preference (through intercept) at the consideration stage, then some brands have a higher probability of entering the consideration stage. This would lead to smaller consideration set sizes comprising brands having large brand equities. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> Note that if we ignore intrinsic brand preference, we would get biased estimates of the distribution of consideration set sizes.</p></div>

This is to be expected because detergents are a higher expense item than ketchup, and there is greater price variability in the detergent category compared with the ketchup category. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> This may also suggest that through advertising, the leading brands in this category have been able to increase the intensity of preference for the differentiating attribute, thereby reducing price sensitivity. We find the variance of quality sensitivity, 2 = 0 4739 which is comparable with that for liquid detergents.</p><p>The value of the intrinsic search cost C 0 is estimated at 0.0284, which is lower than that for liquid detergents. This suggests that price search is less costly in the ketchup category. We conjecture that this could be because shelf space assigned to the ketchup category is much smaller than that assigned to liquid detergents, thereby making price comparisons easier for ketchup. Table <ref type="table">8a</ref> reports the average consideration set size of 2.25 under the baseline case where no brands are displayed or featured. Even though the baseline search cost for observing the price of a brand in the ketchup category is smaller than that in liquid detergents, we see a counterintuitive result that the average size of the consideration set is almost the same for both ketchup and detergents. The reason is that the variance of the prices of the brands is much higher on average in liquid detergents than in ketchup. This results in a larger propensity to search in liquid detergents than in ketchup, which further leads to larger consideration set sizes for liquid detergents. The reduction in search costs due to feature ads, C 2 , is −0 0142. Thus, if all the brands are feature advertised, the average consideration set size increases from the baseline case of 2.25 to 2.45. Further, a lower value of C 2 for ketchup relative to that for liquid detergents suggests that consumers are more likely to see feature ads for liquid detergents than for ketchup. The reduction in search costs due to displays, C 1 , is −0 0105 and is significant.

This corresponds to an average consideration set size of 2.28. This indicates that consideration sets for both liquid detergents and ketchup are almost the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we advance a structural model of price search wherein a consumer engages in an optimal trade-off between incurring costly search against the additional potential benefits arising from price search while deciding on the number of brands to search. This is motivated by the fact that because of frequent price promotions of varying depths of discount, there exists considerable price uncertainty; whereas consumers are aware of the distribution of prices, they do not know the actual posted price of a brand on a given purchase occasion unless they search. We conceptualize this price search as the basis for consideration set effects. Specifically, in our conceptualization, the set of brands that the consumer selects to sample the posted prices on any particular purchase occasion is termed as the consumer's optimal consideration set. After making the optimal consideration set choice, the consumer selects the brand (from among those in her consideration set) that yields the highest expected surplus. Our structural analysis of consideration set effects reiterates several important behavioral aspects of brand choice.</p><p>Our model captures consumer heterogeneity in the following three distinct ways: first, the stochastic Bayesian quality learning captures the heterogeneity in the consumers' quality beliefs. Second, the random effects specification on the consumer's marginal willingness to pay for quality captures the slope heterogeneity, and third, letting consumers differ in their search costs on the basis of their demographic profile captures the heterogeneity in search costs. In our empirical analysis, we find that consumers incur significant search costs to discover the posted prices of the brands, which implies that they do not consider all the brands on a specific shopping trip. Further, we find that, for the two product categories of interest, although in-store display activities and feature ads do not influence consumers' quality perceptions of the brands, they significantly reduce the search costs of the brands and thereby increase the probability of the brands being considered. Also, we find that in-store feature ads reduce the consumers' search costs more than in-store displays in both the product categories, and per capita income of the consumer's household significantly increases their search costs in the liquid detergent product category. Finally, while comparing our model with other competing models on consideration, we show that the consumers' price sensitivity is seriously underestimated if we were to assume that consumers get to know the posted prices of all the brands at zero cost, and the consideration set sizes can be seriously overestimated (as in other competing models of consideration) if we do not include the brand intercept term in the utilities in the consideration stage.</p><p>We consider this paper an important first step to in studying consideration effects in the context of FPPs from a structural modeling perspective using scanner panel data. Having said that, we realize the limitations of the proposed econometric specification. First, in our specification, as the number of alternatives increase, the combinatorial space of the number of consideration sets explodes, and the estimations become much more challenging. Nevertheless, having a large number of alternatives does not make it impossible to implement the model because we use the MSM methodology that considerably eases the estimation. Second, we assume that the consumer adopts the fixed-sample search strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Stigler 1961)</ref> in discovering the posted prices of the brands in her consideration set. It may be interesting to investigate the insights about consideration effects using a sequential search <ref type="bibr">(Roberts and Stahl 1993)</ref> framework. Third, we assume that the consumers know the true price distributions of all the brands. This assumption can be relaxed if we were to assume that consumers learn about the price distributions of brands from the observed posted prices. Fourth, although we recognize consumer uncertainty about brand qualities and model evolution of consumer quality perceptions, because our model is based on a static utility-maximization paradigm, it fails to capture the richness of variety-seeking behavior that can be obtained in a dynamic utility-maximization framework (the so-called multiarmed bandit problem). Fifth, we have used "brand composites" rather than stock keeping units (SKUs) as the discrete alternatives that consumers consider and select. In other words, all the UPC items sharing the same brand name are aggregated to create one single brand. However, if the analysis were done at the UPC level, several UPC items would share the same brand name. Therefore, even if a UPC item is never purchased, the consumer would still learn about its quality because of correlated quality learning. In that case, we would have to assume a correlated quality learning mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Erdem 1998)</ref>. Finally, our model raises the possibility that a brand with different sizes can influence the inclusion of one or more sizes of the brand in the consumer's consideration set by changing the prices of its offerings or selective promotion through feature or display. Such a strategic behavior may be an added reason for brand size/flavor proliferation. An analysis at the brand-size level will offer additional insights in to the issue. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gonul and Srinivasan (1996)</ref> show that future promotion expectations might affect current purchase behavior. Incorporating the implications for current consideration set is another significant issue. We hope to address these issues in a future research effort.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2Evolution of Mean Quality Beliefs for Fifteen Purchase Occasions (Liquid Detergents)Evolution of Quality Beliefs</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Clearly, this is a simplification for reasons of analytical tractability. One could potentially allow consumers to update their beliefs about the distribution of brands in their consideration sets.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">Please see R. D.<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Willig (1978)</ref> and W. M.<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hanemann (1984)</ref> for additional details.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We make this assumption for expositional simplicity. In our empirical analysis, we use an initialization sample to estimate consumers' initial quality beliefs and use these for the estimation sample.6  We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this as a possible reason for quality uncertainty.Marketing Science/Vol. 22, No. 1, Winter 2003</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">In this sense, the product category is more a credence good rather than an experience good<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Horstmann and</ref> MacDonald 1994, Kotler  1996).8  The assumption that the noise associated with consumption experience is normal is made to make use of the fact that normal density is self-conjugate.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">This is similar to the case of discrete choice models<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McFadden 1981)</ref>. The consumer knows her utility for the different brands and hence can deterministically determine which brand yields the highest utility. In contrast, the analyst does not know the random components of the consumer's utility function and hence can only make probabilistic statements about consumer brand choice.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="17">This is equivalent to allowing consumers to differ in their price sensitivity. Furthermore, assuming to be gamma distributed ensures that negative price sensitivity for all consumers.</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="19">We thank the area editor and two anonymous reviewers for several excellent suggestions on modeling consumer search costs.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="20">In the liquid detergent category, brands are often feature advertised and displayed. The frequency of feature advertisements varies from 7% to 14% across the four selected brands. Similarly, the frequency of displays varies from 6% to 22% across the brands.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="21">These represent our hypotheses about the impact of various factors on the intensity of price search behavior. The sign of the parameter is ultimately determined by the data.</note>

The test thus entails whether the proposed model (i.e., Model I) significantly outperforms the competing model. The test statistic is distributed 2 with 1 d.f.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="24">Note that, unlike the competing models, Model I draws on demographics and other situational factors. Therefore, to show that Model I outperforms the other models not because it draws on more information than them, we have tested a variant of Model I that uses the same information as the competing models. We still find that the variant of Model I outperforms all the competing models for both liquid detergent and ketchup data sets.</note>

We find that, in this case, consumers consider one brand 19.7% of the time, two brands 27.9% of the time, three brands around 30.1% of the time, and four brands the rest (22.3%) of the time. Thus, the predicted average size of the consideration set is 2.55, which is comparable with those from AS (1995),SBM (1995), and BV (1996).29  We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.Marketing Science/Vol. 22, No. 1, Winter 2003</note>
