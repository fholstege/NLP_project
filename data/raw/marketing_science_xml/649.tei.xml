<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Here are the answers to Eric Tsang's questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Tsang 2009)</ref> regarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Shugan (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Shugan ( , 2009</ref>. Can We Define Realism as the Extent to Which an Assumption Corresponds with the Real World?</p><p>Yes, but that's irrelevant. Realistic assumptions depend on context. It is not realistic to assume people act in their own best interest when formulating theories of dysfunctional behavior. The same assumption is usually realistic when formulating theories about market behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can We Test Assumptions as We Test Predictions?</head><p>Yes, but do not reject theories based on tests of assumptions. For example, do not reject the assumption that matter is composed of atoms because the assumption fails for plasmas. Do not reject the biological theory of cells because the assumptions fail for viruses. Do not abandon your clock because time depends on the observer's speed and location in a gravitational field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can the Same Prediction Be Generated by Completely Different Assumptions?</head><p>Yes, but different assumptions also generate conflicting implications. Test competing theories on the conflicting implications, not the common implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Can Unrealistic Assumptions Generate Dangerous Theories?</head><p>Yes, but so can realistic assumptions. For example, Aristotle's theory of five elements, Aristotle's theory of gravity, the emission theory of vision, caloric theory, humoralism, and many other theories all seemed realistic in their day, but were wrong and shown wrong by predictive testing.</p><p>It is dangerous to evaluate theories on arbitrary notions about the realism of assumptions rather than evaluating them based on the objective testing of predictions.</p></div>		</body>
