<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Advertising is paramount for most firms. In vertically differentiated contexts, firms often position themselves in the quality/price spectrum so as to create a stable image that is attractive to consumers. For example, a new automotive brand or a new supermarket may want to position itself in the "premium" category to attract high-value customers or in the lower-end market to attract customers looking for more affordable options. The goal of this positioning effort is to match products to buyers: an advertisement provides some information that is relevant to consumers before they have a chance to verify the product or service for themselves. This verification, or search, can take very different forms depending on the context of analysis: it may consist of a visit to a physical or online store in order to find more about a product or service, a tour of an open house while looking for a new home, or a test drive while looking for a new car.</p><p>Despite the informative value of advertising communication, a well-known tension arises: because the source of the information is an interested party, advertisements can be biased so as to cater to the interests of the firm. The automotive manufacturer may boast about the stability and driving comfort of a new model, the supermarket may claim to have the best prices or the best produce in town, and a real estate agent may highlight photos of the exquisite art nouveau handrails, digitally enhanced to look appropriately exquisite.</p><p>This paper investigates the conditions under which credible advertising exists in vertically differentiated markets when claims about quality can be verified by consumers through search. The result of advertising acting as a matching mechanism between products and buyers is extended to vertically differentiated markets with incentives for misrepresentation. Credibility arises because an advertisement can be attractive to a customer segment while unattractive to another one, leading the firm to make trade-offs across messages. For example, a claim of "high quality" is credible to higher-income customers (who have a high willingness to pay for quality) precisely because that statement simultaneously detracts other customers (in this case, lower-income ones). In this sense, high quality is not always "good news" for all consumers. Because the firm has an incentive to misrepresent itself, the question of what the optimal policy of advertising should be naturally arises. I find that the socially optimal advertising policy allows for a limited amount of misrepresentation by the firm.</p><p>A model of communication between a firm and consumers is analyzed in the context of a vertically differentiated market. The main advertising decision for the firm is the content of the message conveyed to consumers. The model is applied to a market for a "search good," where the goal of advertising is to Gardete: Cheap-Talk Advertising and Misrepresentation in Vertically Differentiated Markets 610 Marketing Science 32(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">609-621, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> induce consumers to become interested in the product to the point of spending some type of effort to find out more about it, much in the spirit of search goods as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nelson (1970)</ref>. Hence, the search cost can be thought of as any cost that consumers may incur to gain knowledge about the product. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The model is first applied to a setting where quality can be either high or low. In this case I find that advertising can play a role because the incentives of the firm and of the consumers match: the firm tells the truth about its quality, and consumers respond appropriately. A necessary condition for this outcome to hold is that the uncertainty over quality has to be high enough for the content of advertising to be credible.</p><p>The case of continuous quality is also analyzed. First, the outcome where the incentives of the firm and of consumers are aligned is replicated. Second, a new case where the firm may have an incentive to mask its true quality so as to induce consumer search is found: a semiseparating equilibrium takes place where some firm types are able to attract consumers through advertising even though the latter would be unwilling to search had they known the true product quality. This result is in contrast with the "bait-andswitch" practice (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lazear 1995)</ref> where the firm lures the unsuspecting (naïve) customer with an offer, only to trade the consumer up (in terms of quality and price) after the search cost has been sunk. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In contrast, I find that a low-type firm lures the forward-looking (strategic) consumer by communicating that product quality and price are moderate and then trades the consumer down toward a less desirable quality level (as well as lower price).</p><p>An important assumption in the current model is that different types of consumers have access to different outside options. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This assumption follows from the interpretation that the marginal utility of quality (parameter " " in some vertical differentiation models) is proportional to the inverse of the consumers' marginal utility for income (cf. <ref type="bibr">Tirole 1988, pp. 96-97)</ref>. In that case, higher consumer types (in ) hold higher incomes and may have access to different outside alternatives than those accessible to lower consumer types. This assumption implies that only the firm holding a product of high enough quality prefers to serve the high-end consumers, because it competes with a high outside option. It follows that whenever significant demand heterogeneity exists (i.e., marginal valuations for quality differ significantly in the market), low-type consumers may not always want to search if they believe that the quality of the product is high. Instead, they will anticipate that the firm selling such a product is focusing on high-type consumers and setting a high price. In this sense, high quality is not always good news for the lower type consumers. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> This setting reveals a matching problem between the firm and the consumers. The firm makes a strategic choice with its advertising message, which may or may not be truthful. Consumers are not required to believe the claim of the firm. Instead, they update their beliefs about the quality and the price of the product and decide whether to undergo search.</p><p>The present analysis describes how advertising can be credible because of its content (i.e., its message). It differs from the classical approach considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kihlstrom and Riordan (1984)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Milgrom and Roberts (1986)</ref>, where the observable cost of advertising serves as a credible signal for consumers. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The cheap-talk literature (mainly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crawford and Sobel 1982)</ref> provides the underlying framework for costless (or cheap) communication between agents. The current work endogenizes the "sender bias" presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crawford and Sobel (1982)</ref> by considering that the firm may want to misreport its product quality so as to attract different consumers and increase profits. The result that communication is found to be informative as long as the bias for misrepresentation is not too high holds in the current analysis.</p><p>The advertising literature includes only a small number of references that focus on the content of advertising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagwell and Ramey (1993)</ref> initiate this work by proposing that in certain conditions firms may prefer to advertise truthfully if they share similar interests with consumers. In their paper, firms have preferences over consumer types because of a quantity/margin trade-off. Credibility occurs when the preferences of the firms and of the consumers match. For example, high-type consumers may prefer a firm with high quality, but low-type consumers may become discouraged because of price. In addition, high-type firms would rather attract high-type consumers who buy a few units at a high price, whereas low-type firms may prefer to attract low-type consumers and sell more units at a lower margin. A firm undergoing misrepresentation would attract undesirable customers and would thus become worse off. <ref type="bibr">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagwell and Ramey (1993)</ref> show that "costless" communication may not always suffice to match products to buyers; in this case firms have to resort to dissipative advertising when the incentives of consumers and of the firms' are not aligned: "Incentives for misrepresentation may exist [ ] and, thus, costless quality claims will not always suffice to communicate quality." In contrast, this paper finds that costless quality claims can be informative despite the existence of incentives for misrepresentation. It considers the case of unattractive firm types, which may be better off from misrepresentation. The rationale is as follows. Although customers understand that there is a likelihood of the firm to be unattractive, they may be willing to search if they are not fully certain of its true quality. Misrepresentation is profitable for the firm first and foremost because it conveys that the product is affordable. Second, such a firm benefits even if consumers "regret" their decision of visiting the store. At that point, the search cost has been sunk, and consumers may prefer to purchase after all. The model predicts that unattractive firm types induce consumer search by associating with higher types, but not too high, and the information conveyed by advertising becomes sparser as quality decreases because of lower-type firms pooling upward. Finally, a very low-quality firm would not like to attract the high-end customers because it will compete with a higher outside option. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2010)</ref> consider the case of unverifiable advertising of products with multidimensional attributes. They show that when consumers are uncertain about both horizontal and vertical characteristics of the product, the firm can benefit from communication by emphasizing one of such dimensions (but not both). In particular, the firm partitions the message space so as to become indifferent between messages and attain credibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2013)</ref> apply this result <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In particular, credibility takes place when the fixed costs of both types of firms are relatively similar, and so the expected number of customers served by each firm is approximately the same. Whenever the fixed costs are very different, there exists a profitable deviation through misrepresentation: because the firms with low entry costs have little ability to attract their preferred customers because of competition, they may be better off by changing their advertising message and instead attract a higher number of customers of their least desirable type. In the current model, consumers buy only one unit of the good and costs are constant across types, so no quantity/margin trade-off occurs. Instead, the preferences of the firm over different consumer segments are driven by the fact that consumers have access to distinct outside options. In this case, a low-type quality firm may prefer to attract low-type consumers so as to compete with a lower outside option.</p><p>to advertising in the context of discrete choice models and also extend the analysis to comparative advertising. Unlike the applications by Chakraborty and Harbaugh, the current model focuses on a market for a "search good" in which consumers have a chance to gather information about the product before buying. Communication requires only one dimension of uncertainty, and informativeness is attained because of the trade-offs that the firm has to face due to demand heterogeneity and because of endogenous pricing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Renault (2006)</ref> investigate advertising strategies in horizontally differentiated settings. They find that when the firm can disclose the product fit to the consumer through advertising, forcing the firm to reveal its type may be socially harmful. I find a similar result holds in a vertically differentiated market under cheap-talk communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson and Renault (2013)</ref> extend the analysis to a vertically differentiated setting. However, advertising credibility depends on the firm not being able to misrepresent itself. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anand and Shachar (2007)</ref> provide a model of advertising in which firms decide how much to invest in the precision of their messages, which may or may not be interpreted correctly by consumers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mayzlin and Shin (2011)</ref> consider the advertising disclosure decisions of firms and show that they may choose uninformative advertising in the context of bandwidth-limited communication. A review of research in advertising in its role of matching products to buyers is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bagwell (2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and defines the equilibrium concept. Section 3 presents and discusses the main results. Section 4 analyzes the welfare effects of allowing misrepresentation, and §5 considers the case of costly advertising coverage. Section 6 provides a discussion and concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A Model of Advertising and Search</head><p>Consider the case of a monopolist firm endowed with a product of quality q ∼ F • , where F • is a cumulative distribution function with a discrete or continuous bounded support Q. The product quality is the firm's own private information. After the firm observes its product quality, it decides its price and its advertising strategy. Its message space coincides with Q, and its advertising message is observed Marketing Science 32(4), pp. 609-621, © 2013 INFORMS by consumers prior search. Production costs are normalized to 0 and assumed independent from quality. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Two segments of consumers exist (denoted by subscript S ∈ L H ) each of size 1, who differ in their marginal valuations for quality H L , such that H &gt; L ≥ 0, and in their outside options t H t L , where t H &gt; t L ≥ 0. Consumers observe the advertising strategy of the firm and decide whether to search or not by incurring a search cost k &gt; 0. Their utility from buying is given by S q − p + i , where q is the product quality, i is a preference shock distributed U − , and p is the price of the product. Consumers learn each of these elements in case they decide to search. 9 If consumers decide not to search or decide not to buy after the search cost has been incurred, they get some utility t S from their outside option. The search cost is assumed to be relevant in the sense that it is not too low that consumers would always like to search or too high that advertising could not change their search decisions; is assumed to be large relative to the remaining parameters so that the pricing analysis relies on a linear demand function where the firm chooses interior prices. The assumption that i is uniformly distributed with large support (i.e., is large) is not necessary, but it greatly simplifies the analysis. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The support of the distribution function F • is assumed to be bounded such that the seller is willing to cater to all customer segments in case all of them search. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> All proofs are presented in the appendix.</p><p>Two comments about the basic setup of the model are in order. First, I assume prices are unobservable to consumers prior to search, and second, I limit the message space to the quality space Q. Both assumptions are also present in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagwell and Ramey (1993)</ref>. The first assumption is consistent with the fact that final prices are often unavailable to consumers before search. Even when the final prices are available, firms often offer extra conditions, warranties, and add-ons that are unavailable to consumers until search is realized. Other times, extra negotiations take place during the transaction phase. This is the norm for some products such as real estate and automobiles. It is possible, however, to consider more complex models where prices could also be used as signals of quality together with the advertising message. Second, limiting the communication space to the quality space Q is assumed for simplification purposes. Consider the case where price is also communicated. If the message m = q p is internally consistent (i.e., p = arg max q p ), then the quality component is a sufficient indicator for the price (consumers will have correct beliefs over prices given the communication). On the other hand, if the message is not internally consistent (i.e., p is not profit maximizing given the quality component q), then consumers would have to construct reasonable beliefs to account for such contradictory messages. In the current model, consumers interpret message m ∈ Q as a claim of a pair q p * q , expecting to see high (low)-quality claims associated with high (low) prices according to the nature of the firm's profit maximization problem.</p><p>Finally, the requirement about the amount of information that consumers learn upon searching can be easily relaxed. For example, the results do not depend on the ability of customers to separately identify the quality level from the preference shock in S q + i . In fact, the results hold even if there is minimal learning about the composite S q + i . The underlying intuition is that even a little learning is enough for consumers to care about which type of firm they decide to search and, consequently, for the firm to care about the type of consumers it will attract. The model results are also robust to consumers learning with some strictly positive probability. In this case search affects consumers' information on average, and the firm's communication and pricing incentives are driven by the mass of consumers who end up learning after searching.</p><p>The timing of the model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Purchase and Search Decisions</head><p>In this section I describe the stages of the model that are relevant for the purchase decisions of consumers, conditional on their search decisions. If the consumers of segment S decide to search, each consumer will then decide to buy if and only if S q − p + i ≥ t S . Consider first the case where product quality q is known to customers before visiting, and price p is anticipated correctly. After searching, consumers decide whether to buy the product or not. For the ones who decide to buy, their expected surplus becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E S q − p + i i ≥ − S q − p − t S = 1 2 S q − p + t S + (1)</formula><p>Consumers search if and only if the ex ante consumer surplus unconditional on buying is higher than their Firm is endowed by nature with product of quality q</p></div>

When consumers hold beliefs = q ∈ Q 1 about quality, the expected net consumer surplus of segment S is given by E q CS S q .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Pricing Decision and Comparative Statics</head><p>Consider first the case where only one segment of consumers S visits the firm. The only candidate equilibrium price, p * , maximizes the expected profit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q S = p S q − p + − t S 2 (3)</formula><p>where q S denotes the profit of the firm from serving solely consumer segment S. In this case the firm faces a linear demand function. The equilibrium price depends on the quality level of the firm and on the consumer segment that decides to search. The only candidate equilibrium price consistent with only customer segment S visiting is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p * S q = 1 2 S q + − t S (4)</formula><p>The following propositions follow from the consumer and firm-side behavior and are valid independent of quality being discrete or continuous.</p><p>Proposition 1 (Ex Ante Consumer Surplus Comparative Statics). A segment's ex ante equilibrium surplus from searching conditional on quality level q is increasing in both q and S , and it is decreasing in t S .</p><p>Proposition 1 makes intuitive sense: the product of the firm becomes more attractive as quality increases; in addition, as the outside option t S increases, the search option loses value because both the probability of purchase and the expected surplus from purchase decrease. Finally, the expected surplus is not necessarily increasing with type S (because S increases with S but so does t S ), which means that depending on the product quality, the low-type consumers may be interested in searching but the high types may not be, and vice versa.</p><p>Propositon 2 (Ex Ante Consumer Surplus Comparative Statics for Nonparticipating Consumers). When the equilibrium price targets the low-type consumer segment, the ex ante surplus of the high-type consumers conditional on quality level q is increasing in q. However, when the equilibrium price targets the high-type consumers, the ex ante surplus of the low-type consumers conditional on quality level q is decreasing in q for consumers of the low segment.</p><p>The intuition for the second part of Proposition 2 is that the firm draws a substantial amount of profit from the high-type consumers as quality increases. If the firm sets a high price, the benefits from quality increase slower than price for the low-type consumers and ultimately leads them to avoid a product with too much quality.</p><p>The helix-shaped graph in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> summarizes the findings presented until this point. The consumer surplus for the high-type consumers is always Notes.

However, the surplus for low-type consumers decreases in quality if the firm has set price level p * H . All consumer surplus curves intersect at quality threshold q = t H − t L / H − l . This occurs becauseq equates the benefits of quality and opportunity costs across consumer segments. When q &lt;q, the firm prefers to attract the low-type consumers. This happens because it would have to set a very low price p * H in order to profitably sell its product to the high-type consumers. Similarly, when quality is high q &gt;q , the high-type consumers are relatively more attractive to the firm.</p><p>Because of firm incentives, notice that p * H &lt; p * L whenever q &lt;q and p * H &gt; p * L whenever q &gt;q. This is primarily because different consumer segments have access to different outside options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Equilibrium Concept and Its Implications</head><p>The equilibrium concept I use is that of perfect Bayesian equilibrium. I focus on equilibria in which advertising is informative and decisive. Informative means that the consumers' prior beliefs are updated by the existence of communication; decisive means that communication induces search for at least one consumer segment that was previously unwilling to do so. An important point is that there cannot be an informative and decisive equilibrium in which both consumer segments want to visit when exposed to a given advertising message. In this case all firm types would like to use the attractive message, and credibility would break down.</p><p>An implication of the equilibrium concept is that the set of candidate equilibrium prices is reduced to the ones that maximize profits when only one segment of consumers has visited, either L or H. 12</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Market Outcome</head><p>This section outlines the market outcome under two possible scenarios. The first describes the case where quality can take only two values and serves as an introduction to the incentives of agents in the market. This case replicates the finding of matching products to buyers proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagwell and Ramey (1993)</ref>, in which the interests of consumers and of the firm match. The second scenario considers the case where quality is continuous and uncovers the possibility of the firm gaining from misrepresentation. In both cases equilibrium can be characterized by a set of participation and incentive compatibility constraints for the firm and consumers. The following property must hold for informative and decisive equilibria.</p><p>Proposition 3 (Two Regions in Equilibrium). Any informative and decisive equilibrium is composed of two regions L and H , such that only the low-type consumers are willing to search if they believe that q ∈ L and only the high-type consumers are willing to search if they believe that q ∈ H .</p><p>Proposition 3 follows from the fact that if a region that is attractive to both consumer segments in equilibrium exists-say, LH -then all firm types would like to claim to be of that region and increase profits. Similarly, if an unattractive region existed in an outcome, the firm type in that region could do better by changing its message. Hence, the union of L and H spans the entire quality space Q. An equilibrium outcome satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E CS * L q q ∈ L ≥ k (5) E CS * H q q ∈ H ≥ k (6) E CS * L q q ∈ H &lt; k (7) E CS * H q q ∈ L &lt; k (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where conditions ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are participation constraints and conditions ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">8</ref>) are incentive compatibility constraints.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Discrete Quality Case: Two Levels</head><p>Let quality assume two values, q L and q H , with equal probability, and consider the quality thresholds q 1 to q 3 (explicit expressions are provided in the appendix):</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">CS L q 1 p * L = k (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">CS H q 2 p * L = k (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">CS L q 3 p * H = k (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">CS L (p * L ) CS H (p * H ) CS H ( p * L )</formula><p>The thresholds in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> denote quality levels at which consumers change their decision of searching.

However, the lowtype consumers are willing to search if they believe that quality is higher than q 1 and the firm is practicing price p * L . Note that no informative and decisive equilibria can exist in the two-type case if quality falls between q 2 q 3 . In that range the quality/price relation is attractive to both consumer segments prior search, and hence both firm types would like to claim to be in that interval. Another case where no informative and decisive equilibria occur is when q L &lt; q 1 .

Under C 1 , there is an informative and decisive equilibrium where the interests of the firm and of consumers are aligned. Firm q L sets price p * L , and firm q H sets price p * H . Firms announce their types, and beliefs are Pr q L q m L = Pr q H q m H = 1. The intuition for this result is that the possible levels of quality match those sought by different consumer segments: low-type consumers are willing to visit a low-quality firm, and high-type consumers are willing to visit the high-quality firm. Advertising brings value to the market by inducing one or both consumer segments to search. The low-type consumers are now informed that the product is affordable and the high-type consumers are informed that the quality of the product is high enough. In fact, the overall existence of the market may depend on the capacity of the firm to advertise to consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Continuous Quality Case</head><p>It is worth considering the case where quality is continuous-in particular, q ∼ U q L q H . <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The message space is assumed to be the same as the support of quality, Q = q L q H . Suppose a firm type is believed to belong to some quality space Q 0 ⊂ Q. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crawford and Sobel (1982)</ref>, I look for equilibria where the firm randomizes its advertising message uniformly within the space Q 0 = a b , b &gt; a and beliefs are such that consumers believe the claim. In this case, it follows that in equilibrium L = q L q and H = q q H , because firm types to the left ofq prefer to attract the low-type segment, and firm types to the right ofq prefer to attract the high-type segment. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Given these beliefs, it is also clear that all informative and decisive equilibria can only occur when q L &lt; q 2 and q H &gt; q 3 . Otherwise, there would be regions where a firm type would effectively attract both consumer segments, and informative advertising would break down.</p><p>Focusing on the case of mixing over messages introduces some complexity to the analysis. Although it is not necessary, it ensures that all messages are sent in equilibrium and there is no need to specify beliefs off the equilibrium path. It also carries a straightforward interpretation: a firm may provide signals of a larger or smaller support so as to induce more or less uncertainty about its precise quality level. Other approaches are also possible and often preserve the informational and matching nature of the case of message mixing. One such approach would allow only one message per interval of quality cutoffs to mean that the firm belongs to that interval, and all remaining messages would mean the lowest possible quality, q L . In this case the matching and informational results would be similar to the case of mixing over messages; however, the interpretation of the advertising technology would differ. Such a model would suggest an interpretation of Marketing Science 32(4), pp. 609-621, © 2013 INFORMS message clustering, as only a few messages would be used in equilibrium. For example, a firm wanting to pool with a certain type could do so by simply imitating its advertising message. Yet another approach is to restrict the number of messages that the firm can use. In particular, it is possible to show that constraining the message space to two elements (low and high quality) yields the same matching and informational results as those provided by advertising mixing. The resulting advertising messages could be interpreted as a result of constraints related to language not being able to partition the quality space finely enough or consumers/firms having bandwidth-limited communication.</p></div>

The firm types below the quality thresholdq are attractive for the low-type consumers, and the firm types above it are attractive to high-type consumers. In this case advertising leads one or both consumer segments to search and increases the ex ante welfare of the firm and of consumers. Although there exist multiple possible configurations of advertising messages, the regions L and H are unique. For example, one can consider the case where firm types with lower-quality levels pool only with nearby types or do not pool at all. However, all such arrangements yield the same profits for the firm types and the same search decisions for the consumers, independently of the particular advertising configuration.</p></div>

Notice that in this case firm types in the interval q 1 q 2 have no incentive to "burn money" to signal their type, because they would have no gain from separation. Finally, the overall welfare effects of allowing misrepresentation are not clear: there is a chance lowtype consumers search a product they may not like because some firm types with very low quality are now able to enter the market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Welfare Analysis</head><p>This section analyzes the welfare implications of allowing a firm with very low quality to attract consumers through advertising. In particular, I compare the scenario of the firm with quality less than q 1 revealing its type (and being excluded from the market) with the scenario where it pools with types of higher quality and induces search. The surplus of the low-consumer segment unambiguously decreases when the firm is allowed to misrepresent its type. However, the fact that these firm types can now enter the market generates profits, which may outset the consumer loss. Let B = q ∈ q L q 1 be the fact that product quality is unattractive.

The second row displays the expected profits of the undesirable firm when its type is known (profits = 0) and when it is not known (profits &gt; 0) to be of very low quality.</p></div>

This happens as long as the quality or the search costs are high enough or as long as the utility from the outside option is low enough. A policy implication for advertising regulation is that it may be optimal to allow unattractive firms to use advertising in order to induce consumer search. However, this should be allowed only to an extent: when there is a chance firms are of very low quality, it is best to implement a "truthin-advertising" policy that forces them to reveal their true quality.</p></div>

In this case the firm has no incentive to manipulate its advertising intensity to change consumer beliefs, as coverage is not directly observable by consumers. However, the fact that consumers receive an advertisement may be informative in itself. Because advertising intensity is associated with higher levels of quality, receiving an advertisement shifts consumers' beliefs about quality upward. This gives rise to the following result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 8 (Scope for Misrepresentation</head><p>Increases with Advertising Costs). As the cost of advertising coverage increases, the lower bound for quality q L supporting an informative and decisive equilibrium with mismatch of interests decreases.</p><p>This follows from the fact that firm types with higher quality levels spend more on advertising coverage. Two results follow: First, a firm with very low quality will cover only a small fraction of the market. Second, because the odds of being advertised by Marketing Science 32(4), pp. 609-621, © 2013 INFORMS a firm with very low quality are lower than being advertised by one with higher quality, consumers shift their beliefs about quality upward upon being covered by advertising, and thus the scope for misrepresentation increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>This paper describes how advertising can be informative through its content in the context of a vertically differentiated market, even when incentives for misrepresentation from the firm exist. The fact that different firm types may have different preferences over consumer segments in a vertically differentiated market is central for credibility, and no money burning is required for informative communication to take place. In the present setting, a firm with a low-quality product may not want to exaggerate its claims considerably, because doing so can simultaneously scare away potential consumers (who now expect high prices) and attract mostly consumers who would be disappointed with the quality upon search and could decide not to buy. Similarly, a firm with a high-quality product may not want to understate its true quality level because that statement would attract consumers unwilling to pay enough for quality while discouraging others willing to pay more.</p><p>When incentives to misreport exist, effective advertising communication can still take place. In this case the firm with very low quality will associate its advertising message with others right "above it." This has two effects for consumers. First, they cannot tell how low the quality of the firm is. Second, they still learn that the quality is not too high, and so the product is likely to be affordable.</p><p>Allowing misrepresentation in advertising has varying effects on welfare. Although misrepresentation always hurts consumers, it may benefit the firm to the extent that the net effects may be positive. This is especially true if the lowest possible quality level is high enough when compared with the outside option of the low-type consumers or if the search cost is high enough. Surprisingly, I find that the existence of unobservable investments in advertising coverage can lead to existence of a higher degree of misrepresentation, albeit to fewer customers.</p><p>Although the current model is static, the same results apply to the case of repeated interaction. In that case it suffices to verify the incentives for search in the first period, because the option value of searching decreases over time. When deciding whether to search or not, consumers evaluate the scenario of learning about quality today and the probability of purchasing in each of the subsequent periods versus the utility of the outside option over time. The case of a two-period model is presented in the appendix.</p><p>The model is also applicable to online search advertising. For example, a consumer may search online for "fine pens" or "golf clubs." Then, an online search advertisement may provide her some information and induce further search online through a click, or further search off-line through a store visit. For example, the customer can click the ad and then buy a fine pen after inspecting its quality and fit or go through further off-line search and visit the pro shop to try out the set of golf clubs.</p><p>Whereas the analysis above considers the case of a single advertising channel, the case of competition may yield interesting results. Another avenue for future work is the interaction of the advertising message and the availability of multiple advertising channels: the firm may signal its preference over multiple consumer types through its observable allocation of advertising budget across channels. In this case media choice may interact with the role of the advertising message. For example, the use of different media may increase the advertising appeal because of increased fit, but it may also hurt credibility because consumers understand that the firm has an incentive to customize its message according to the advertising channel.</p><p>Similarly, the auxiliary upper bound for quality levelq solves</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">q H = q L H ⇔ Hq + −t H 2 8 = H + L q −t H −t L +2 2 16 (25) ⇔q = √ 2 − 1 t H − t L + 2 − √ 2 √ 2 − 1 H − L (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where the profit expressions come directly from substituting the optimal price from Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) into (3), and the analogue procedure is done for the case where the firm serves both consumer segments.

Consider the case where misrepresentation can occur; i.e., q L &lt; q 1 . As shown in Proposition 6, the advertising content separates q &lt;q from q &gt;q. In addition, the advertising coverage has further implications. Let us focus on the case where the firm draws a product with quality q &lt;q and q L &lt; q 1 . Misrepresentation occurs if quality level q is very low. Consumers use the fact that they are covered by advertising as an informative signal. Define Covered = u &lt; , u ∼ U 0 1 such that is the probability of covering a consumer. Upon being exposed by the advertisement, covered consumers form belief E q Covered . For the low segment, being covered is equivalent to because increasing c is equivalent to stating that quality is above a higher (probabilistic) threshold. Because higher quality is always good news in this region, as the cost of advertising increases, so too does the expected surplus of the consumer. It follows that an informative and decisive equilibrium with misrepresentation can admit a wider support for quality (i.e., lower q L ) as the cost of advertising increases. Welfare effects are not clear, however, because as the cost of advertising increases, the number of consumers exposed to advertisements of the unattractive firm decreases.</p><p>Two-Period Interaction Suppose a two-period setting where consumers can decide when to search. Once they do, they learn the product quality q. Idiosyncratic shocks are assumed to be independent over time. Because the option value of search is higher in the first period (because it can affect decisions in both periods), one only needs to inspect the case of searching in the first period. When q and p are known, the expected utility from searching w.r.t. independent shocks i1 and i2 is given by</p><p>Pr Buy 2 units E 2 units Buy 2 + 2 Pr Buy 1 unit</p><p>• E 1 unit Buy 1 + Pr Not Buy E Not Buy The two-period case yields the same surplus inequality condition for consumers as the one-period case. Although the search decision provides the option value of buying over two periods instead of one, now the consumer trades this benefit to purchasing two units of the outside good or, alternatively, one unit of the good and one unit of the outside good. The simultaneous increase in both options provides the equivalence between the single-period case and the case with multiple periods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Timing of the Model</figDesc></figure>

Hence, one needs not take into account the beliefs of consumers who did not receive the advertising message. Although an interesting analysis, it would also be rather complex.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>As discussed in §2, a product quality range is imposed such that the firm is better off serving both types of consumers rather than just serving one and that all price equilibria are interior. Let such a range be q q . I equate the profits of serving the low (high) customer segment to those of serving both customers in order to find some preliminary bounds on quality, q q while assuming that the optimal prices are interior at such quality levels. I then check for the conditions for interior price solutions to exist. Throughout this analysis, it is assumed that &gt; t H such that consumers are willing to buy the product at zero cost as long as they get the highest possible utility draw. This condition is not required, but when it is assumed it greatly simplifies the relevant parameter space for q.</p></div>
