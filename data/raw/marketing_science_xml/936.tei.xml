<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Store brands, also known as private labels, have enjoyed increased attention in recent years. In the 2001 Progressive Grocer annual survey, retailers rated higher store brand focus as their "most likely action," before efficient assortment and category management. Currently, store brands are the share leaders in about 20% of all food categories, accounting for at least 20% of total store sales in the United States and Europe <ref type="bibr">(Hoch 1996, Steenkamp and</ref>. Moreover, revenues from store brands are expected to grow to an average of 23.9% of total retailer revenues (Kurt Salmon <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Associates 1998)</ref>. In this context, researchers and managers alike underscore the importance of store brand entry in a category. From a strategic perspective, three sets of players are affected by store brand entry and interact to create its net impact: (i) the retailer, (ii) the manufacturers, and (iii) the consumers.</p><p>For the retailer, store brands are the only brands that require taking full responsibility for product introduction, product sourcing and warehousing, advertising, and promotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dhar and Hoch 1997)</ref>. In contrast to the shared risks and returns for national brands, the retailer plays a critical role in the success of the store brand. Moreover, the entry of a store brand changes the retailer-national brand manufacturer interaction from one of cooperation to one of competition for consumer dollars. As retailer performance is linked to all the brands in the category <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Raju 1992)</ref>, this new competitive environment may induce reconsideration of consumer prices for all brands. Finally, entry of the store brand may have store-traffic implications for the retailer <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Walters and Rinne 1986)</ref>. The relevant question for retailers, then, is what is the impact of store brand entry on category and store performance?</p><p>For the national brand manufacturers, the new competitive element in the manufacturer-retailer relationship may change the strategic interaction between the two parties. For example, the incumbent national brand manufacturer may respond to store brand entry with changes in regular prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hauser and Shugan 1983)</ref> and with changes in price promotions <ref type="bibr">(Lal 1990, Quelch and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Harding 1996)</ref>. If store brand and national brand promotions attract the same consumers, intensified competitive reactions could emerge in a battle for market share between manufacturers and retailers. The relevant questions, then, are how national brand manufacturers are affected by store brand entry and how they respond to the new competitive environment.</p><p>The responses of consumers define the demand side. For one, the introduction of a new product such as 365 a store brand may increase primary demand, creating room for win-win scenarios among entrant and incumbent brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hauser and Shugan 1983)</ref>. Alternatively, store brand entry may result in brand switching, drawing buyers away from the existing brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dekimpe et al. 1997)</ref>. Moreover, long-term price sensitivity may change due to the different competitive market structure in the pre-and postentry periods, and the direction of this change may depend on the incumbent brand's position. From a consumer benefits perspective, relevant questions are whether the entry of a store brand increases consumer choice (category product assortment) and whether it lowers retail prices.</p><p>While multiple papers have studied the motivation for store brand entry (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Scott-Morton and Zettelmeyer 2001)</ref>, the strategic positioning of store brands <ref type="bibr">(Sayman et al. 2002, Scott-Morton and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Zettelmeyer 2001)</ref>, the market success of the store brand itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Raju et al. 1995, Dhar and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hoch 1997)</ref>, and the impact of store brands on retailer profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ailawadi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harlam 2002, Kadiyali et al. 2000)</ref>, there is only limited research on the impact of store brand entry for the market players. A notable exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chintagunta et al. (2002)</ref>, who assess the effect of store brand introduction on (1) the retailer in terms of national brand margins and category sales, (2) the manufacturer of the dominant brand(s) in terms of wholesale prices and competitive intensity, and (3) the consumer in terms of (short-term) price elasticities and equilibrium prices. They find that store brand introduction increases national brand margins for the retailer and increases consumer price sensitivity for the dominant brands. Several questions remain, however. First, are these effects of store brand entry permanent or temporary <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dekimpe and Hanssens 1995)</ref>? Second, does the increased price sensitivity and equilibrium price changes generalize to all national brands in the category, or does it depend on their positioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gruca et al. 2001</ref>)? Third, do retailer benefits extend to overall category and store performance? Finally, which of the store brand effects generalize (e.g., to nonfood categories) and which are category specific?</p><p>Our study addresses these questions as follows. First, we take a dynamic approach that assesses whether the beneficial (damaging effects) of store brand entry are permanent or temporary. While promotional activity by existing brands creates at best temporary benefits, new product introduction is likely to create a permanent impact and lead to a new dynamic competitive equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bronnenberg et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Nijs et al. 2001</ref>. A primary contribution of our study, therefore, is to focus on the dynamic impact of store brand entry on manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, and to test whether store brand entry has created such a permanent impact on performance variables by comparing the multivariate equilibrium in the pre-and postentry period. For each period, we also examine the long-term price response of brand and category performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pauwels et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Srinivasan et al. 2001</ref>. Consequently, our approach is complementary to the structural, short-term model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chintagunta et al. (2002)</ref> because we use a dynamicsystems model to assess the long-term impact of store brand entry on the three market players-retailers, national brand manufacturers, and consumers. Second, we expand our discussion to all brands in the category and investigate whether their (price tier) positioning affects changes in long-term price sensitivity, equilibrium prices, and ultimately manufacturer revenue. Third, we test for changes in retailer gross category margin, store traffic, and store revenue. Finally, we analyze four categories (one food and three nonfood products) that experience store brand entry in our dataset, in the spirit of exploratory replication and wider validation of our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ailawadi 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, the introduction of a store brand may impact the performance of and the response from the retailer, the manufacturers, and the consumers and may have temporary or permanent effects, which may well vary across brands and categories. To answer these questions, we conduct an econometric investigation in the four product categories in our retailer dataset that feature store brand entry, such that we have several years of weekly time-series data before and after the introduction. For the retailer, we consider five performance variables: (i) category sales, (ii) category revenue, (iii) category margin, (iv) store traffic, and (v) overall store revenues. Manufacturer performance variables include (volume) sales and manufacturer revenues. For the consumer, we assess the impact of store brand entry on price levels and product assortment. Finally, we estimate and contrast long-term price sensitivity in the pre-and postentry period.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In §2, we review literature on the impact of store brand entry for all three parties. Next, in §3, we describe the testing framework for structural break analysis, the vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX), and their associated impulse response functions. In §4, we give a description of the retailer dataset covering seven years of weekly price and product activity in a regional market for the four categories-hot breakfast cereal, toothbrushes, paper towels, and soap. In §5, we report and interpret the results, and we present the conclusions in §6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background on the Introduction of Store Brands</head><p>The focus of this study is on understanding the impact of store brand entry for all three market play- ers. Therefore, we review the existing literature for the retailer, for the manufacturers, and for the consumers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes our hypotheses.</p><p>2.1. Impact of Store Brand Entry for the Retailer Store brand entry may benefit the retailer in several ways, all of which represent reasons to become a player in the category. First, store brand entry can enable retailers to strengthen their bargaining position vis-à-vis national brand manufacturers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Narasimhan and Wilcox 1998)</ref>. In general, the channel power of the retailer is believed to increase as a result of store brand entry, which changes the nature of manufacturer-retailer interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoch and Banerji 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Raju et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Hoch 1996</ref>. Specifically, store brands may allow the retailer to negotiate lower wholesale prices on national brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mills 1995)</ref>. Moreover, retailers can strategically position store brands in the product space to strengthen their bargaining position when negotiating supply terms with manufacturers of national brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Scott-Morton and Zettelmeyer 2001)</ref>.</p><p>A second benefit of, and motivation for, store brand entry is category expansion. If the store brand is more attractive than the best incumbent brand for certain shoppers, store brand entry may increase category value and thus expand category sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mason 1990)</ref>. Moreover, store brand entry may shake up a "dormant" category <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hauser and Shugan 1983)</ref>. Competitive reactions of incumbent brands include price reductions and higher promotional activity, which could in turn stimulate primary demand.</p><p>Third, the store brand itself may generate profits because of its high unit margin and potentially high volume. As for the former, store brands typically carry higher retailer margins than national brands do, even after accounting for direct product costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ailawadi and Harlam 2002)</ref>. As for the latter, the retailer may introduce a store brand to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Connor and Peterson 1992)</ref>. Finally, potential retailer-demand benefits at the store level include increased store traffic and store revenues. Recent research suggests that store brands make shopping easier for consumers, and that they increase store image and store loyalty by improving store differentiation vis-à-vis other retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hoch and Lodish 2003)</ref>. Recent empirical findings indeed connect store brand use and store loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Ailawadi et al. 2001, Corstjens and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lal 2000)</ref>. However, it appears unlikely that store brand entry in any one category would significantly increase store traffic, given at best modest store-switching effects reported in previous literature <ref type="bibr">(Walters and McKenzie 1988)</ref>. Therefore, we do not expect the introduction of a store brand in a single category to influence store performance.</p><p>In summary, we expect the retailer to benefit from store brand entry through (1) higher unit margins on the national brands, (2) category expansion from the store brand itself and/or from higher volumes on the national brands, and (3) higher gross category margin, as a result of (1), (2), and retailer margin on the store brand itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Impact of Store Brand Entry</head><p>for Manufacturers When the retailer enters a category with a store brand, the retailer changes from being a customer to being a competitor for the national brand manufacturers. Consequently, it is important for national brand manufacturers to understand how store brand entry affects their own performance and how they should react to this event. Previous literature suggests that the relative positioning of the incumbent brands visà-vis the new entrant affects both the incumbent's performance impact and the incumbent's optimal defensive reaction. We discuss these topics in turn.</p><p>In the broader context of defensive strategies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hauser and Shugan (1983)</ref> proposed the Defender modeling framework to understand how a brand ought to respond to competitive entry. Later expansions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. 2001</ref>) agree that the first consideration is the extent to which the entrant is competitive with the incumbent brand and thus will affect the incumbent's performance. This degree of competition depends on the relative positioning of the brands, with price and perceived quality as key dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989)</ref>. In the case of store brand entry, consumers are typically willing to pay more for national brands versus store brands based on perceived quality differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mills 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Narasimhan and Wilcox 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Raju et al. 1995</ref>. The literature on asymmetric and neighborhood price effects indeed confirms that while premiumtier national brands are relatively insulated from store brands, consumers of lower-priced national brands are more likely to switch to store brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blattberg and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wisniewski 1989, Sethuraman et al. 1999)</ref>. Therefore, the store brand is more likely to compete with second-tier brands than with premium-tier national brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hoch 1997, Hoch and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lodish 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Besides the performance impact, the incumbent's positioning also affects their optimal defensive reaction. In their expanded framework of discrete market segments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. (2001)</ref> find that the direction of optimal price changes depends on the degree of overlap among the segment's choice sets. If the entrant brand does not fully compete in all consumer segments, the optimal incumbent brand's reaction depends on its closeness to the entrant's position.</p><p>On the one hand, incumbents closest to the entrant should reduce prices. Indeed, incumbents often intensify price competition by offering temporary price promotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lal 1990)</ref> or by introducing lower-priced varieties <ref type="bibr">(Hoch 1996, Quelch and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Harding 1996)</ref>. On the other hand, incumbents furthest away from the entrant should raise prices. Intuitively, this price increase is optimal because the entrant drives the incumbent out of price-sensitive segments, but leaves the incumbent's core segments untouched <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hauser and Shugan 1983)</ref>. Store brand entry and the prospect of a resulting price war at the lower end of the market may indeed lead premium national brands to abandon (occasional) attempts to attract priceconscious consumers and to focus exclusively on their core quality-conscious consumers. This renewed focus allows a price increase, especially when combined with quality improvements. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hauser and Shugan (1983)</ref> recommend product improvement and repositioning away from the entrant's strength. Because store brands usually compete on price, premium-tier national brands could build on their strength by introducing high-end product varieties, which increases average brand price. As these potentially different incumbent reactions play out, entry of a store brand may redefine competitors in the market, with price competition intensifying between some brands but not between others <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gruca et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we expect the relative positioning of the incumbent national brands to affect both the impact of store brand entry on performance and the defensive strategy followed by these incumbent brands. First, store brands are more likely to compete with, and hence hurt, the performance of second pricetier national brands rather than first price-tier (premium) national brands. As a result, second-tier brands will adopt a more retaliatory defensive strategy (such as decreasing the average brand price) than other national brands. In fact, premium national brands may well accommodate the store brand entry by maintaining or even increasing average brand price. Evidently, the key to defensive action is knowledge about how consumers react to store brand entry, the issue to which we turn next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Impact of Store Brand Entry on Consumers</head><p>The responses of the consumers to store brand entry and the resulting category environment are of crucial importance for both the retailer and the manufacturers. First, the new store brand may create additional demand for the product or share the existing market by drawing buyers from existing brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dekimpe et al. 1997)</ref>. Second, store brand entry may change consumer price sensitivity in the category. In assessing the impact of entry on incumbent price sensitivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Huber et al. (1986)</ref> categorize brands as "bracketed" (in the middle of the pricequality continuum) versus "boundary" (at the high or low end of the continuum). Brands that switch from a boundary to a bracketed condition should experience increased price sensitivity (as supported in simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. 2001)</ref>. In our case of store brand entry, incumbents with relatively low price points may change from a boundary to a bracketed brand and thus experience increased price elasticity. As higher price sensitivity implies a lower optimal price, these incumbents are likely to increase discounting. In contrast, high-end incumbents will not switch from boundary to bracketed and may even experience reduced price sensitivity as they focus on their core quality-conscious consumers. Therefore, their optimal price does not decrease and may even increase. These predictions have yet to be empirically confirmed.</p><p>Store brand entry may benefit consumers in several ways. First, the presence of a new brand increases consumer choice in the category and thus may improve category attractiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mason 1990</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoch and Banerji 1993)</ref> may convert some priceconscious shoppers who normally do not buy in the category into regular category consumers. Third, the competitive reactions of national brands may include product improvements and price reductions, both of which in turn increase category value. However, several theoretical frameworks shed doubt on a categorywide decrease in retail prices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">In Mills' (1995)</ref> model, wholesale prices fall more than retail prices do, as store brand share increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lee and Staelin (2000)</ref> argue that store brand entry does not lead to lower retail prices, but does reduce wholesale prices, especially when the national brands are undifferentiated. Therefore, it remains an empirical question whether store brand entry actually benefits consumers through lower retail prices on national brands and lower average price paid in the category.</p><p>In sum, the impact of store brand entry for the retailer, the national brand manufacturers, and consumers remains an empirical puzzle in existing marketing literature. We seek to fill this void by assessing the transitory versus permanent financial impact of store brand entry on manufacturers, retailers, and consumers by using data for seven years from four categories and examining the impact of store brand entry on long-term price sensitivity. In the next section, we introduce time-series techniques to address these questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In recent years, time-series methods such as unit-root tests and cointegration tests, vector autoregressive models (VARX) and vector error-correction models (VECM), have emerged to quantify the long-run impact of marketing activity <ref type="bibr">Hanssens 1999, Bronnenberg et al. 2000)</ref>. However, these studies examine the performance implications of temporary price promotions or gradual increases in distribution rather than the structural changes that occur as a result of store brand entry. An event such as store brand may result in a market shake-up, changing the underlying data-generating process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pesaran and Samiei 1992)</ref>. Therefore, we use structural break analyses in conjunction with VARX models to assess (1) to what extent store brand entry created a permanent (structural) change to the level, trend slope, and variance of each variable; (2) whether interactions among performance and marketing variables differ before versus after store brand entry; and (3) how long-term price response differs in the new competitive environment.</p><p>Our methodological approach consists of three steps. First, we introduce structural break unit-root tests to investigate whether store brand entry created structural change to each variable (univariate). Next, we analyze how performance and marketing variables interact in a vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and how these interactions changed with store brand entry (multivariate). Finally, we contrast long-term price sensitivity in the pre-and postentry periods by estimating and comparing price impulse response functions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> summarizes and integrates these methodological building blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Permanent vs. Transitory Impact of Store</head><p>Brand Entry: Structural Break Unit-Root Tests Our analysis proceeds sequentially. First, we test for evolution versus stationarity of all performance and price series by applying the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) procedure <ref type="bibr">(Enders 1995, p. 257)</ref> to check for the presence or absence of unit roots. While the ADF test is the most widely used unit-root test in marketing, several factors may bias its results <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Maddala and Kim 1998)</ref>. Specifically in our context, store brand entry may induce changes in the level, trend slope, and the error term of Equation (1). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> As for the latter, we perform Brown-Forsythe (modified Levene) tests for a significant difference in the variance of each series in the pre-versus postentry period. When there is heteroskedasticity in the error term, the appropriate unit-root test to use is the Phillips-Perron (PP) test <ref type="bibr">(1988)</ref>. Moreover, because both ADF and PP unit-root tests are known to be biased towards finding evolution when there is a structural break to the level and/or trend slope of the studied variable, we subject all the series to the innovational-outlier (IO) test of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Perron (1990)</ref>. Finally, we acknowledge that the exact date of store brand entry is only one candidate for a structural break in the performance variables, as manufacturers and consumers may react with lead/lags to store brand entry. Therefore, we perform the endogenous break test <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zivot and Andrews 1992)</ref>, which endogenously determines breakpoints over the data period.</p><p>In case more than one variable is found to have a unit root, we test for a long-run equilibrium, known as cointegration, among those variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Maddala and Kim 1998)</ref>. Consistent with our research focus, we apply the recent extension to the Johansen cointegration test <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Johansen et al. 2000)</ref> that accounts for structural breaks. Finally, we test for the possibility that store brand entry affects the long-run relationship between variables by performing the test in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gregory and Hansen (1996a, b)</ref>, allowing structural change in the cointegrating relationship.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dickey and Fuller (1979)</ref> Are performance and marketing variables stationary (mean-reverting) or evolving (unit root)?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Vector Autoregressive Model with Exogenous Variables (VARX)</head><p>We extend the vector autoregressive modeling approach to capture (i) the long-run impact of store brand entry into the market and (ii) the dynamic interactions between performance series and marketing variables before and after store brand entry. Previously, VARX models have been used to assess the long-run effects of marketing activity such as advertising, distribution, and price promotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Srinivasan et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Pauwels et al. 2002</ref>. Such models are especially well suited to measure dynamic interactions between performance and marketing variables and to estimate dynamic market response <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dekimpe and Hanssens 1995)</ref>. Tractability and reliable estimation of this highly flexible model requires selectivity in the number of variables to include in one VARX model, and whether to treat them as endogenous or exogenous <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pesaran and Smith 1998)</ref>. For each category, we simultaneously model brand volume sales, VOL i t , together with the retail prices P i t , the wholesale prices (WP i t for all major brands and an "other brands" composite. From these variables, we can reconstruct our performance measures detailed in §4: sales and manufac-turer revenues at the brand level; and sales, retailer revenues, and retailer margin at the category level.</p><p>To investigate store-level effects, we replace the brand volume series with store traffic and average shopper spending.</p><p>The treatment of prices as endogenous implies that they too are explained by their own past and the past of the performance variables. Specifically, the VARX model accounts for dynamic performance response to marketing, for lagged effects of performance on own prices (performance feedback), and for dynamic interactions with competitive prices. The contemporaneous effects among the endogenous variables are modeled through the residual covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lütkepohl 1993)</ref>.

The second set of exogenous variables includes (i) feature (FT) activity, (ii) display (DP) activity, and (iii) product variety (PV) for each brand. We choose to include these marketing actions as exogenous variables because (1) we want to avoid overparametrization bias to affect our estimates of the price coefficients, the focus of our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pesaran and Smith 1998)</ref>,</p><p>(2) recent research has shown little is gained by allowing for more intricate feature and display dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Nijs et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Srinivasan et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Van Heerde et al. 2000</ref>, and (3) the measurement, and hence the time series, of these variables typically differs substantively from those of prices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Parameter Stability and Structural Change in</head><p>the Multivariate Equilibrium Given the specified VARX model, we are now able to assess whether store brand entry changed the dynamic interactions in this multivariate system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>371</head><p>First, we assess whether store brand entry affected the stability of the model's parameters. Because this change date is known, we use the Wald test of structural change <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kornelis et al. 2001</ref>). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Next, if the parameter stability tests show structural shifts in the data-generating process of the key variables, we assess the sign, size, and significance of the structural change. A first option is to include interaction terms of the store brand entry dummy with each of the model components, which is appropriate in the absence of a strong hypothesis that only some model components change <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kornelis et al. 2001)</ref>. Such a procedure would drastically reduce the degrees of freedom in the VARX model, especially when one also needs to account for variance changes in the endogenous variables (as revealed by the Brown-Forsythe tests of our first methodological step). An equivalent and efficient way of capturing these phenomena is to estimate pre-and postentry VARX models separately and to compare the multivariate equilibrium levels and the long-term price response of the performance variables. Note that "equilibrium" is defined in a statistical sense as the matrix of stable means to which the variables revert after being shocked. This multivariate equilibrium is calculated from the data and does not have a theoretical economic interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Srinivasan et al. 2000</ref>. Specifically, we calculate the multivariate equilibrium levels-based on the VARX model-for the pre-and postentry periods. In addition to the preentry variables, the postentry VARX model includes the store brand's volume, retail price, and wholesale price as endogenous variables and its display, feature, and product activity as exogenous variables.</p><p>To formally compare the pre-and postentry equilibrium, we obtain standard errors by the Monte Carlo simulation approach. Specifically, we sample 250 draws of the estimated VAR parameters using the means and covariances, and then calculate the equilibrium levels associated with each set of draws. We then use these 250 draws to compute the empirical means and standard errors for the equilibrium values for all endogenous variables and hence conduct stringent tests of differences in the pre-and postintroduction periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Impulse Response Analysis of the Over-Time</head><p>Impact of a Price Shock on Performance The estimated VARX models allow us to simulate the over-time effects of a marketing action on each performance variable . Note from Equation (1) that VARX models capture immediate as well as lagged, direct as well as indirect, interactions among the endogenous variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Srinivasan et al. 2001)</ref>. Our main interest lies in the net result of all these actions and reactions over time, which can be derived from a VARX model through its associated impulse-response functions. These impulse-response functions estimate the incremental effect of a "shock" to a marketing variable on the performance variables relative to their baselines (their expected values in the absence of the marketing shock). Specifically, we measure the long-term performance response to a oneunit price shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Pauwels et al. 2002</ref>). Because we did not have prior information on leaders versus followers in promotional decisions, we adopted the simultaneous-shocking approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Evans and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wells 1983, Dekimpe and</ref>, in which the information in the residual variancecovariance matrix of Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is used to derive a vector of expected instantaneous shock values. Standard errors are subsequently derived using the Monte Carlo simulation approach with 250 runs in each case . We estimate impulse response functions on the pre-and postentry VARX models. Next, we accumulate all significant impulse response coefficients to compute the long-run (cumulative) impact of a price shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pauwels et al. 2002)</ref>. The difference between the performance impact before versus after store brand entry represents the change in long-run price sensitivity in the new multivariate equilibrium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Level of Analysis</head><p>Because the retailer's costly decision to introduce a store brand is typically a chainwide initiative, we want to assess the economic consequences for all parties at the chain, instead of at the store, level. We guard against aggregation bias (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allenby and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rossi 1991, Pesaran and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Smith 1998)</ref> by performing a pooling test and by estimating a pooled fixedeffect model that accommodates heterogeneity among stores (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Horváth and Wierenga 2002)</ref> to validate our chain-level findings. Potential loss of efficiency is limited because of the large number of time-series observations in our dataset. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Description</head><p>The time series we use are based on scanner data from a large Midwestern supermarket chain, Dominick's Finer Foods. With 96 stores in and around Chicago, this is one of the two largest chains in the area. The relevant variables include unit sales at the SKU level, retail (consumer) prices, feature and display activity, 5 store traffic, and store revenue. Additionally, retail Marketing Science 23(3), pp. 364-390, © 2004 INFORMS margin data allow us to calculate the average acquisition cost of each SKU to the retailer. Because the retailer herself uses this data to judge profitability, the average acquisition cost is a useful, though imperfect, 6 measure of the wholesale price of the manufacturer to the retailer, given the purpose of our paper (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chevalier et al. 2003 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chintagunta 2002</ref> for a detailed discussion). All price data are appropriately deflated using the Consumer Price Index; the base ( = 100) is week 1 of our observation series, beginning in September 1989. A total of 399 weeks of data are available for the time period from September 1989 to May 1997. As we are studying the chainwide impact of store brand entry, we aggregate sales volume data across stores and the SKU data to the brand level using constant weights (average share across the full sample period; see <ref type="bibr">Pauwels et al. 2002, Footnote 2)</ref>. Potential store aggregation bias is limited because Dominick's adopts a uniform product strategy and conducts a chainwide promotional strategy in which prices are lowered by a uniform percentage across all stores in the chain <ref type="bibr">(Hoch et al. 1995, pp. 27-28)</ref>.</p><p>Out of a total of 25 product categories, five feature store brand entry within the available data period: hot breakfast cereal, toothbrushes, paper towels, bath (bar) soap, and frozen pasta. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The latter category is shaken up by two highly successful national brand entries right before store brand entry, with an explosion in category volume as a result. Moreover, we have only 36 weeks of clean data in the postentry period, resulting in insufficient observations to estimate the VARX models. For these reasons we do not study the frozen pasta category. Within the four remaining categories, we focus on the major national brands and the store brand. For hot breakfast cereal, we consider premium brand Nabisco, 8 with average preentry retail price of $1.28, and second-tier uchicago.edu/research/mkt/Databases/DFF/W.html). Following <ref type="bibr">Chintagunta et al. (2001)</ref>, we refer to these marketing activities through the more common labels of "feature" and "display." <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The acquisition cost averages wholesale prices over time, which induces additional autocorrelation as the measure only slowly adjusts to manufacturer deals. By the same token, however, the acquisition cost incorporates forward buying, which makes it an attractive measure to compare retailer margins before and after store brand entry. Finally, the average acquisition cost does not include manufacturer allowances or other side payments to the retailer.</p><p>7 Store brand entry is simply defined as the fact that the retailer starts offering at least 1 SKU of the store brand during the data period, irrespective of whether the store brand was still offered at the end of the data period or of its achieved market share. Therefore, the results do not appear to be subject to survivor bias as were, for example, early studies on first-mover advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lieberman and Montgomery 1988)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out that Nabisco's product form is wheat, while Quaker's and the store brand's is oat. Our reasons for including Nabisco are twofold: (1) The retailer  Note that, as expected, the store brand enters as the lowest-priced brand in each category. Moreover, each category includes premium-priced brands (Nabisco, Oral-B, Bounty, Viva, Dove, Lever 2000) and secondtier-priced brands (Quaker, Reach, Colgate, Scott, Dial, Ivory). In the remainder of this paper, we therefore refer to the former as "premium national brands" and to the latter as "second-tier national brands." includes this brand in the hot breakfast cereal category, both physically (shelf placement) and conceptually (in the dataset); and (2) our analysis shows that Nabisco has significant cross-price elasticities with both Quaker and the store brand.  Performance Measures. For the manufacturer, we consider brand sales as well as manufacturer revenues, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">MR i t = VOL i t × WP i t</formula><p>where VOL i t refers to sales volume of brand i at time t, and WP i t is the wholesale price of brand i at time t <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Srinivasan et al. 2001)</ref>. For the retailer, a more extensive set of performance measures is considered. In addition to category sales, we also derive the total category revenue:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">RR t = n i=1 VOL i t × P i t</formula><p>where P i t refers to the price of brand i at time t and n is the total number of brands in a category. Additionally, we compute retailer total category margins (defined in dollars) as: For a similar operationalization of retailer performance measures, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Srinivasan et al. (2001)</ref>. We also analyze two store-level performance variables-store revenue and store traffic. The feature and display promotional variables for each brand are operationalized as the percentage of SKUs that are promoted in a given week. Product variety is operationalized as the number of SKUs for each brand in a given week. Finally, promotional frequency and depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jedidi et al. 1999</ref>) are defined consistently with the impulseresponse functions that estimate the incremental effect of a "shock" to price: A promotion week is defined as a week in which the price shock is at least two standard deviations below the mean shock. We define the brand's price-promotion frequency as the proportion of promotion weeks (as defined above) for the brand and the brand's price-promotion depth as the (percentage) difference between a brand's promotional price shock (in a promotion week) and the brand's average price averaged across all nonpromotion weeks.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">RM t = n i=1 VOL i t × P i t − WP i t</formula><p>It is important to note that our data cannot yield an exhaustive account of all effects of, and reactions to, store brand entry. Specifically, we do not observe trade deal activity, advertising, and interretail competition. Moreover, we do not have a direct measure of quality and quality changes. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Still, we feel that the length and breadth of the available time series, together with the distinction between wholesale and retail prices, allow us to answer important questions on the long-run impact of store brand entry for the retailer, the manufacturers, and the consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>In correspondence with our methodology discussion, we first examine whether store brand entry structurally changes each of the manufacturer and retailer performance and marketing variables (Univariate Result Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">3-6</ref>). We then discuss who benefits from store brand entry, based on the VARX multivariate equilibrium levels of these variables (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">7-10</ref>). Finally, we contrast long-term price sensitivity in the pre-and postentry periods (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Unit-Root and Structural Change</head><p>Test Results For each manufacturer and retailer performance and marketing series, we discuss (1) whether a structural change occurred to the level or trend slope (evidenced by evolution results for the ADF and PP unit-root tests, but stationarity results for the Perron or Zivot-Andrews tests that allow for a structural break)  and (2) whether a structural change occurred to the variance.</p><p>Hot Breakfast Cereal Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">3</ref> reports the test results for the hot breakfast cereal category. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For second-tier brand Quaker, store brand entry produces a structural change in performance. First, both brand share and revenue are classified as evolving by the ADF and the PP unit-root tests. The Perron tests confirm that a structural break occurred at the time of store brand entry. Both series are classified as stationary after allowing for this break. Second, the variance of all performance series shows a significant increase after store brand entry. Finally, Quaker's wholesale price variance shows a significant increase after store brand entry.</p><p>In contrast, the manufacturer performance series for premium brand Nabisco are all classified as stationary, while its wholesale price is classified as trend stationary (trending up). No variance change occurs for Nabisco's wholesale price, but its performance series do experience a variance increase after store brand entry.</p><p>For the retailer performance series, category revenue, store traffic, and store revenue are stationary. In contrast, category sales experiences a structural break at store brand entry, and category margin shows a structural break eight weeks after store brand entry (as identified with the Zivot-Andrews test). We verified that this endogenously determined breakpoint is also valid for the other series, and use it, instead of the entry date, in subsequent analysis. The variance increases for all category performance series. As for pricing, Quaker's retail price is stationary, while Nabisco's retail price is trend stationary (trending up). The Brown-Forsythe test for retail price variance indicates an increase for both brands. Finally, feature and display activity do not show a structural break at store brand entry, but category product variety and average price do. Toothbrush Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">4</ref> reports on the test results for the toothbrush category.</p><p>Second-tier brand Reach experiences a structural break in brand sales and brand revenue, and a significant increase in wholesale price variance. In contrast, manufacturer performance is stationary for Colgate and premium brand Oral-B. Moreover, wholesale price variance does not change with store brand entry. All three brands experience a structural change to product variety. Turning to the retailer, all the performance seriescategory sales, category revenue, category margin, store traffic, and store revenue-are stationary. With respect to retail prices, prices of Colgate and Reach are trend stationary (trending up), while Oral-B's price is stationary. Feature and display activity are stationary, whereas category product variety and average price experience a structural break. Finally, retail price variance increases for all three brands.</p><p>Paper Towels Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">5</ref> reports on the test results for the paper towels category.</p><p>While second-tier brand Scott's share and revenue experience structural change, all manufacturer performance series are stationary for premium brands Bounty and Viva. Performance variance is lower for all three national brands. Wholesale price is stationary for all brands, whereas product variety experiences structural change for Scott and Bounty.</p><p>For the retailer, all category and store performance series are stationary. We also find that the retail prices of Bounty and Viva are stationary. Retail price variance increases for Bounty, decreases for Viva, and remains unchanged for Scott. Finally, feature and display activity, and average price, are stationary, whereas category product variety experiences a structural break at store brand entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Soap Category. Table 6 reports on the test results for the soap category.</head><p>Second-tier brand Ivory experiences a structural change to performance at store brand entry. Moreover, its wholesale price variance increases. In contrast, the other brands have stationary performance series. Wholesale price variance does not increase for Dove, and decreases for Lever 2000 and Dial.</p><p>Turning to the retailer, all the performance seriescategory sales, category revenue, category margin, store traffic, and store revenue-are stationary. With respect to retail prices, prices of Dial and Ivory are stationary, whereas prices of Dove and Lever 2000 experience a structural break. Retail price variance  increases only for Ivory. Again, feature and display activity, and average price, are stationary, whereas category product variety experiences a structural break. In summary, the unit-root and structural break tests indicate that store brand entry does create a persistent, structural change in at least some performance and price variables in all four categories. Closer inspection reveals systematic variation in these structural change findings. On the one hand, second price-tier brands such as Quaker hot breakfast cereal, Reach toothbrushes, Scott paper towels, and Ivory soap experience a structural change in their sales and revenues. Moreover, Quaker, Reach, and Ivory increase their wholesale price variance, suggesting a structural increase in their price promotional frequency to the retailer. This finding is consistent with Narasimhan and Wilcox's (1998) assertion that store brands improve the bargaining position of the retailer vis-à-vis the manufacturer. On the other hand, the manufacturers of premium brands in all four categories-Nabisco, Oral-B, Bounty and Viva, Dove and Lever 2000-do not see a structural change in performance nor an increase in the wholesale price variance. Moreover, some second-tier brands (Colgate and Dial) do not experience structural change either. From the retailer's perspective, only the hot breakfast cereal category experiences a significant structural change in category sales and category gross margin. From the consumer's perspective, product variety, but not average price paid, experiences a structural break for all categories. To assess the extent of the reported changes after store brand entry, we next turn to estimating the VARX models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Parameter Stability Tests of the VARX Models</head><p>The parameter stability tests for the full-period vector autoregressive models represent a multivariate test on structural change at the time of store brand entry. The Wald tests <ref type="bibr">12</ref> show that structural shifts occur in the data-generating process of virtually all performance variables. Therefore, we capture all these changes by estimating pre-and postentry VARX models separately to compare the multivariate equilibrium levels and the long-term consumer and competitive response estimates. The former reveal who is better off after store brand entry; the latter indicate how consumer and competitive response are different in the pre-and postentry periods. The pre-and postentry equilibrium levels are reported in Tables 7-10</p><p>for the four categories. Our discussion focuses on the changes for the manufacturers, for the retailer, and for the consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Do the Manufacturers Benefit from Store Brand Entry?</head><p>Hot Breakfast Cereal Category. The pre-and postequilibrium levels of manufacturer performance are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">7</ref>. First, we find that Quaker's share and revenue experience a permanent, structural change after store brand entry: Its weekly revenues decline from $44,435 to $36,200. In contrast, Nabisco's performance is slightly improved after store brand entry, for both sales and revenue. The sales results occur despite Quaker's lower (wholesale and retail) prices after store brand entry, and despite Nabisco's higher (wholesale and retail) prices. Both changes  1 Because all series are stationary after allowing for the structural break, these multivariate equilibrium levels equal the mean of each series in each period.</p><p>* Significant at the 10% level; * * significant at the 5% level; * * * significant at the 1% level.</p><p>are in line with our expectations for second-tier and premium brands. On the one hand, Quaker now directly competes with an entrant that is both lower priced and favored by the retailer in terms of feature and display activity. On the other hand, premium brand Nabisco gradually increases price (by introducing higher-priced varieties) without incurring volume loss. The implied decrease in price sensitivity is formally tested below.</p><p>Toothbrush Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">8</ref> shows that secondtier brand Reach is adversely affected on all three performance measures-sales, share, and revenue. Its (wholesale and retail) price increases, and its product assortment grows by 10 SKUs. In contrast, premium brand Oral-B's performance is slightly higher in the postentry period. Oral-B introduced a large number of product-line extensions, increasing its product assortment by 16 SKUs. Finally, Colgate's performance remains unaffected despite a modest price increase. A possible rationale is the strong increase in product variety by 13 SKUs. Overall, only Reach-but not Colgate or Oral-B-is worse off after store brand entry. Interestingly, the retailer does not appear to favor the store brand in terms of feature and display decisions. Apparently product innovation plays a major role in the toothbrush category, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and Colgate <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Studies by Colgate show that toothbrushes is one of the few supermarket categories in which consumers feel that substantial and Oral-B seem to have done a better job than Reach in this respect.</p><p>product improvement has occurred in the nineties and still expect substantial future improvements (personal conversation with Jim Figura, Vice President of Consumer Insights, Colgate).  Paper Towel Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">9</ref> shows that manufacturer performance decreases for second-tier brand Scott, but not for premium brands Bounty nor Viva. Scott loses five share points and manufacturer revenue decreases despite a price decrease and a spectacular increase in product variety from 11 to 26 SKUs. We infer that Scott is mainly introducing lower-priced varieties, in contrast to Bounty, which doubles its assortment with higher-priced varieties. As in the hot breakfast cereal category, the retailer clearly favors her own brand in terms of feature activity: The store brand becomes the most featured brand and all national brands, especially Scott, lose in this respect.</p><p>Soap Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">10</ref> shows that second-tier brand Ivory is adversely affected on sales and revenue. In contrast, premium brand Dove's performance is slightly higher in the postentry period, despite a modest price increase. Dove sees an increase in SKUs from 8 in the preentry period to 13 in the postentry period. Lever 2000 shows a similar pattern, increasing its assortment from 2 to 9 SKUs. Interestingly, second-tier brand Dial doubles its assortment and does not experience performance decline. Here too, as in the toothbrush category, product variety plays a major role with Dove, Lever 2000, and Dial doing a better job than Ivory.</p><p>In sum, our results indicate that there are significant differences among brands in terms of the effects of store brand entry on manufacturer performanceentry is beneficial to some brands and detrimental to others. A striking consistency across the four categories is that store brand entry is typically beneficial for premium price national brands (Nabisco, Oral-B, Bounty and Viva, Dove and Lever 2000), but not for second price-tier national brands: Quaker, Reach, Scott, and Ivory lose, whereas the performance of Colgate and Dial is unaffected. These results largely confirm Hypotheses 4-6. In particular, note that the premium-price brands are able to maintain or even increase market share, often despite higher prices, while most second-tier brands lose market share, often despite lower prices. Overall, most incumbents behave according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. (2001)</ref> and their prescriptions for situations without complete segment overlap.</p><p>On the one hand, premium brands accommodate store brand entry in the price variable: retail and wholesale prices increase. On the other hand, second price-tier brands typically retaliate against store brand entry with lower prices and/or increased promotional activity. Previous findings in line with our results include <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoch and Banerji (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ailawadi et al. (2001)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Quelch and Harding (1996)</ref>, Procter and Gamble phased out White Cloud toilet tissue and Oxydol because these second-tier brands could not profitably compete with the store brand. The notable exceptions in our dataset are Colgate and Dial, which raise average price by successfully introducing higher-priced varieties and maintain performance in the postentry period. These observations reflect the recommendation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tyagi and Raju (2001)</ref> that incumbent national brands should focus on differentiation when faced with store brand entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Does the Retailer Benefit from</head><p>Store Brand Entry?</p><p>Hot Breakfast Cereal Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">7</ref> shows the pre-and postequilibrium levels of retailer performance for the hot breakfast cereal category. Consistent with the unit-root and structural break tests, category sales and category margin increase after store brand entry. The increase in category margin is due to the increased margin on the store brand as well as to the lower wholesale price that Quaker charges the retailer. The retailer unit margin on premium brand Nabisco also increases, as the wholesale price increases less than the retail price does. There are no effects of store brand entry on store performance-store revenue and store traffic are relatively stable in the pre-and postentry periods. Apparently, the revenue increase in the hot breakfast cereal category is (1) not sufficient to significantly increase store revenue or (2) is a result of category switching. Toothbrush Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">8</ref> shows that all retailer performance series are relatively stable for the toothbrush category. In the postentry period, the category margin is slightly higher, reflecting significantly increased unit margins on all national brands, category sales, and category revenues. These changes occur gradually, as the unit-root test did not show a structural change at store brand entry.</p><p>Paper Towels Category. Similar to the toothbrush category, we find no structural change in any retailer performance measure due to store brand entry. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">9</ref> shows that all retailer performance series are lower for the paper towel category in the postentry period. Category margin decreases despite significantly higher unit margins on premium brands Bounty and Viva (the retailer unit margin decrease for Scott is insignificant). The key reason is the decline in category sales, which is not offset by increased retail prices of the brands in this category. These changes occur gradually as the unit-root test did not show a structural break at store brand entry.</p><p>Soap Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">10</ref> shows that all retailer performance series are relatively stable for the soap category. In the postentry period, category sales and revenues are slightly lower. As in the case of toothbrushes and paper towels, these changes occur gradually and are not significant. Unit margins are significantly higher for Dove and Ivory, but not for Lever 2000 and Dial.</p><p>In summary, we find support for Hypothesis 1: Store brand entry structurally benefits the retailer by increasing unit margins on national brands in all four categories. In the case of increasing wholesale prices, retail prices increased more. In the case of decreasing wholesale prices, retail prices decreased less. Only 2 out of 12 national brands did not experience increased retailer unit margin in the postentry period. However, these increased unit margins do not translate into structurally higher retailer performance in the toothbrush, paper towels, and soap categories. For all three nonfood categories, neither category sales nor retailer gross category margin significantly increases in the postentry period.</p><p>In contrast, both primary demand and retailer category margin increase for the hot breakfast cereal category. This intriguing difference could be due to characteristics of the store brand, the product category, or the competitive reactions. First, the store brand itself is only expected to increase category demand if it is more attractive than the best incumbent brand for a substantial number of shoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mason 1990)</ref>. Second, consumption appears more flexible in a food category such as hot breakfast cereal, as consumers can easily substitute away from other food products <ref type="bibr">(Bell et al. 1999, Ailawadi and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Neslin 1998)</ref>. Third, the hot breakfast cereal category shows the largest decrease in average price paid after store brand entry, which provides an additional motivation for category expansion. Moreover, competitive forces besides store brand entry may drive category performance such as product innovation, combined with higher prices, in the nonfood categories.</p><p>Finally, store brand entry does not have a significant effect on store traffic and store revenue for any category. While this finding is expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Walters and MacKenzie 1988)</ref>, it remains possible that store brands have an effect in aggregate across categories on store traffic. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Overall, our results suggest that while the entry of a store brand is a profit contributor, taking advantage of the lower variables costs and higher perunit margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hoch and Lodish 2003)</ref>, these category benefits are insufficient to significantly increase traffic building or revenues at the store level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Does Long-Term Price Sensitivity Differ</head><p>After Store Brand Entry? Based on the preentry and postentry VARX models, we estimate the long-term response of brand volume <ref type="bibr">15</ref> to a price shock by, respectively, each national brand and the store brand. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">11</ref> reports these long-term elasticities, reversing the sign for ease of interpretation (i.e., higher value for higher price sensitivity).</p><p>Hot Breakfast Cereal Category. After store brand entry, the brand volume price elasticity is significantly higher for Quaker and other brands, but significantly lower for premium brand Nabisco. These findings are consistent with the lower price for Quaker and the higher price for Nabisco after store brand entry.</p><p>Toothbrush Category. Consistent with the hot breakfast cereal category, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">11</ref> shows increased brand volume price sensitivity for second-tier brand Colgate and other, but not for premium brand Oral-B. Surprisingly, second-tier brand Reach does not experience increased price sensitivity.</p><p>Paper Towels Category. Consistent with the hot breakfast cereal and toothbrush categories, brand volume elasticities increase for second-tier brands Scott and other, but decrease for premium brands Bounty and Viva.</p><p>Soap Category. Brand volume elasticity decreases for premium brands Dove and Lever 2000, but increases for second-tier brand Ivory. Similar increases for second-tier brands Dial and other are not significant.</p><p>In summary, we find that long-term brand sales response to price shocks changes consistently after store brand entry. Premium brands maintain or even decrease price sensitivity, whereas second-tier brands typically experience increased price sensitivity, although such change is not always statistically significant. On the other hand, changes to the price response of other performance variables are typically insignificant.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Does the Consumer Benefit from Store</head><p>Brand Entry? Based on the information in our dataset, consumers may benefit from store brand entry in three ways. First, category choice may increase as more product varieties are offered in the postentry environment. Second, retail prices on national brands may decrease. Finally, increased promotions for national brands and the low store brand price may decrease actual price paid in the category, as consumers can switch to cheaper alternatives when they see fit.</p><p>Hot Breakfast Cereal Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">7</ref> shows that consumers enjoy increased product variety in the postentry period as both national brands offer more product varieties and the store brand becomes available in six versions. Moreover, second-tier brand Quaker's retail price is lower after store brand entry and the store brand is cheaper than either national brand. In contrast, premium brand Nabisco's retail price is higher in the postentry period. Finally, price promotional depth and frequency increases for both national brands. As a net result of these phenomena, average price paid is 5% lower in the postentry period. The structural increase in category demand is consistent with both increased product variety and the lower prices paid in this category. Toothbrush Category. Just as in the hot breakfast cereal category, product variety is higher after store brand entry in the toothbrush category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">8</ref> reveals a spectacular increase: All three national brands almost doubled their number of SKUs in the postentry period. As a result, the total product variety in the toothbrush category increased 80%; from 59 in the preentry period of the store brand to 105 in the postentry period. Retail prices are higher for all national brands. Together with the stable category sales, this phenomenon indicates that the national brands introduced higher (perceived) quality versions, for which consumers were willing to pay higher prices. On the other hand, price promotional-depth is higher for all brands, and price promotional frequency increases for Oral-B and Reach. Together with the success of the lower-priced store brand, this change accounts for a reduction in average price paid in the category.</p><p>Paper Towels Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">9</ref> shows that product variety increases for paper towels too. Both Bounty and Scott more than double their product assortment, while the store brand is offered in five versions. Retail prices are lower for Scott and Viva, but higher for Bounty in the postentry period. Price promotional frequency is higher for all brands, but price-promotional depth increases for Bounty and decreases for Viva. As a net result, average price paid is 12% higher, and category sales are 19% lower in the postentry period. Considering their net impact on average price, high-priced product introductions played a larger role in the paper towels category than store brand entry did.</p><p>Soap Category. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">10</ref> shows that consumers enjoy increased product variety in the postentry period. Retail prices are slightly higher in the postentry period for all national brands except Dial. Pricepromotional depth is lower for all brands, whereas frequency increases for Dove but decreases for the other brands. As in the toothbrush category, national brands introduce higher (perceived) quality versions, for which consumers are willing to pay more. The net result after store brand entry is a very slight decrease in the average price paid in the category.</p><p>In sum, our results indicate that there are some beneficial effects of store brand entry for consumers. First, in support of Hypothesis 10, product variety increases in all four categories, including more versions of all national brands. Second, average price paid is lower after store brand entry in three categories (Hypothesis 9). Third, in support of Hypothesis 8, retail prices only decrease for some second-tier brands, not for premium brands. This outcome logically follows from the increased price sensitivity estimates for second-tier brands after store brand entry. In contrast, price sensitivity typically decreases for the premium brands, in support of Hypothesis 7. The net result of these changes is a slight reduction in average price paid for hot cereal (−4 5%), toothbrushes (−1 8%), and soap (−0 7%). These results closely reflect the simulations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. (2001)</ref>, which predict average price decreases of between 0.4% and 3.6% for a market with four incumbents. In contrast, the average price-paid increases for paper towels (+12%) is driven exclusively by the increased popularity and price of Bounty (all other brands decreased their price).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Validation of the Results</head><p>Contrast with Categories Without Store Brand Entry. We acknowledge that care is needed in the interpretation of the VARX results of changes to equilibrium levels and to promotional response. After all, several exogenous factors may have caused the reported differences between the periods before and after store brand entry. For instance, consumers may have become more price sensitive over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mela et al. 1997)</ref>, their demographic and psychological profile may have changed, as could their patronage among stores. As a result, the reported changes in financial performance variables may be due to maturation factors that affect all categories in the retail chain. Therefore, we validate our findings by estimating split-half VARX models and their associated impulse-response functions for the 20 categories that do not feature store brand entry. If general maturation factors are responsible for the observed changes in the store brand entry categories, we should observe a similar change in mean performance and promotional response of the other categories.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">12a</ref> shows the mean results for the split-half (before versus after 11/25/1993) estimates of the multivariate equilibrium levels for these 20 categories. No patterns emerge for manufacturer revenues or for retailer category revenues. Interestingly, retailer category margin is on average lower in the second half of the data period for the categories without store brand entry. In contrast, two out of four categories with store brand entry, hot breakfast cereal and toothbrushes, show increased retailer margin. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">12b</ref> shows the mean results for the split-half (before versus after 11/25/1993) estimates of long-term price response for the 20 categories without store brand entry. Note that the promotional impact on all performance variables is slightly higher in the latter half of the data period. This trend is directionally similar to that observed for some second-tier brands, but not to that observed for premium brands confronted with store brand entry. Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">12c</ref> shows that the average increase in product variety is 22% for the 20 control categories versus 64% for the 4 categories with store brand entry.</p><p>In summary, we observe that the reported changes in categories with store brand entry do not generally apply to the categories without store brand entry.</p><p>Pooling vs. Aggregation. Finally, we guard against aggregation bias by performing a pooling test and by estimating a pooled fixed-effect model (FEM) that accommodates heterogeneity among stores (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Horváth and Wierenga 2002)</ref> to validate our chainlevel findings. The pooling test fails to reject the gains additional support (H6b), while no additional evidence is found counter to the hypotheses. The robustness of our substantive findings to pooling across stores is in line with (1) our choice of a linear model which has been shown to be the least sensitive to the store aggregation issue (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Christen et al. 1997</ref>) and (2) assertions of limited heterogeneity in marketing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allenby and Rossi 1991)</ref> as "DFF conducts a chainwide promotional strategy in which prices are lowered by a uniform percentage across all stores in the chain." (See, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hoch et al. 1995, p. 28.)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the impact of store brand entry on manufacturers, retailers, and consumers using data from four product categories over several years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of store brand entry with convergent evidence from modern time-series techniques. Specifically, both the structural break unit-root tests and the VARX parameter stability tests show that structural change occurred at the time of store brand entry in the four categories. We group our findings on the beneficial effects of store brand entry for manufacturers, the retailer, and consumers, and summarize as follows:</p><p>For the manufacturers, store brand entry is typically beneficial for premium-price national brands, but not for second price-tier brands. Interestingly, the premium brands accommodate store brand entry in the price variable; both retail and wholesale prices increase. Revenues improve because this price increase is not offset by volume loss. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that premium brands do not directly compete with the store brand, but instead focus on serving their core quality-conscious consumer segments with the introduction of new product varieties. In contrast, second-tier brands typically retaliate against store brand entry with lower prices and/or increased promotional activity. As price competition intensifies in the lower end of the market, other national brands differentiate themselves by raising prices (and presumably perceived product quality). Specifically, our results suggest that new product introductions at higher prices have a positive impact on manufacturer performance. Even in the particular situation of store brand entry, we find support for the general defensive product strategy recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hauser and Shugan (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gruca et al. (2001)</ref>. Investment in product innovations can enhance a brand's competitive advantage and provide a basis for a sustainable price premium over store brands-innovation and judicious pricing are the two important components of a successful manufacturer competitive strategy. Toothbrush brand Colgate offers a prime example of such strategy: Its significantly larger product assortment commands higher wholesale and retail prices in the poststore brand-entry period. We acknowledge, however, that the success of such strategy is not guaranteed: Similar increases in product variety and prices do not stop toothbrush brand Reach's performance decline.</p><p>For the retailer, we consistently find two beneficial effects of store brand entry: (1) high unit margins on the store brand itself and (2) higher unit margins on the national brands. In the case of decreasing retail prices, wholesale prices decrease even more. In the case of increasing retail prices, wholesale prices increase to a lesser extent, if at all. This increase in unit margins implies that the retailer indeed strengthened its bargaining position vis-à-vis national brand manufacturers. Moreover, these unit margin increases are typically not offset by volume loss for the retailer, as premium national brands maintain their sales level and second price-tier brands lose market share to the store brand. However, these benefits do not always translate into higher gross category margin. In fact, we only find a structural increase in retailer margin for the hot breakfast cereal category, which also experiences higher category demand. Our results support the empirical generalization that, despite their bargaining position, retailers have not been able to consistently increase category profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ailawadi 2001)</ref>. Moreover, any beneficial effects of store brand entry appear to be limited to the product category: We do not find any evidence of a structural boost to store traffic or store revenue.</p><p>Consumers do not see a general price decrease on national brands after store brand entry. Whereas secondtier brands often, but not always, become cheaper, premium brands become even more expensive. The most consistent consumer benefits are an enlarged product assortment by both store and national brands and intensified price promotional activity. While we do not observe all components of social welfare (product quality, manufacturer, and retailer costs), our findings on average price and category demand allow for some speculation. For both hot breakfast cereal and toothbrushes, average price paid is lower and category sales are higher after store brand entry. It appears that some social surplus is created, which benefits the retailer (higher category margin), the premiumtier national brand (higher manufacturer revenues), and the consumers (lower average price and enlarged product assortment). In contrast, the paper towels category experiences an increase in average price paid, while both the paper towels and soap category experience a decrease in category sales in the postentry period. In these categories, store brand entry does not appear to benefit the retailer (lower category margin) and the second-tier national brands (lower revenues for Scott and Ivory). Consumers still enjoy increased product choice, including the low-priced store brand.</p><p>Overall, our findings on category demand offer a potential "win-win" scenario for the retailer and premium brand manufacturers and invite national brands to rethink their perception of store brands as detrimental. While store brands and national brands Marketing Science 23(3), pp. 364-390, © 2004 INFORMS compete for market share, they may mutually benefit in the stimulation of primary demand in certain categories.</p><p>Despite providing a number of interesting insights, our study has several limitations that provide an opportunity for future research. First, we had data only from a single chain-Dominick's. Therefore, we could not study the impact of store brand entry on competition between retailers. Still, the potential for such impact appears limited, as we do not find any effect of store brand entry on store traffic and revenues. It would be valuable to extend our results with data from other retailers in other product categories. Second, other factors beyond store brand entry may influence our estimates in the pre-and postentry periods. As we have established that store brand entry did produce structural change, future research could compare this impact with the effect of other structural changes that may have occurred in the full time period. Third, our focus on pricing actions leaves other marketing variables such as product quality, packaging, and advertising as unexplored topics in the context of store brand entry. In particular, recent research suggests that store brands intentionally imitate the leading national brands, and thus are more likely to compete with the market leader <ref type="bibr">(Sayman et al. 2002, Scott-Morton and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Zettelmeyer 2001)</ref>. Our empirical findings do not contradict this phenomenon, as the market leader happens to be a second-tier brand in each of our categories. Future research could disentangle the price tier versus market leadership explanation. Fourth, we had information on retail prices and retailer unit margins, which allows calculation of average wholesale prices. While the empirical analysis did show evidence of wholesale price adjustment by some manufacturers, change may have occurred in other promotional expenses from manufacturers to the retailer, such as slotting allowances, buy-back charges, failure fees, etc. Fifth, we focused on the typical case of store brand entry in the lower price tiers. Full-scale entry by high price-tier store brands may well lead to different results, and remains an unresolved topic for future research. Finally, our dataset of four categories enables exploratory replication, rather than large-scale hypothesis testing to explain the cross-category variation in store brand entry effects. More extensive datasets would allow a test of the theoretical framework on cross-category differences, integrating previous literature on multiple category characteristics affecting consumer response (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Narasimhan et al. 1996)</ref>, competitive interaction, and store brand success factors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Raju et al. 1995)</ref>.</p><p>As a general conclusion, store brand entry impacts market players in complex ways. In order to be successful in the market, manufacturers and retailers need to find "win-win" situations with store brand entry. The findings in this paper are important because they show the empirical realization of mutual benefits and because they identify marketing strategies that lead to such win-win situations. Ultimately, the nature of the competitive/cooperative interactions between manufacturers and retailers helps determine success versus failure in today's marketplace.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Market Shares for the Hot Breakfast Cereal Brands Quaker, Nabisco, and the Store Brand</figDesc></figure>
