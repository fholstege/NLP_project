<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Managers, policy makers, and researchers are interested in understanding the effect of advertising on demand. A large number of response models have been proposed in the literature linking advertising expenditures to sales or market shares. These studies have focused on the shape of the response function (linear or S-shaped), the dynamic effects of advertising (carry-over effects or wearout), and interaction effects with other marketing mix variables, consistent with the desirable properties of advertising response models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Little (1979)</ref>.</p><p>In these response models, advertising expenditures are aggregated and there is an implicit assumption that advertising expenditure is spent on propagating one message or theme. In practice, firms concurrently run several themes in their advertising campaigns (for example, price and product advertisements). Each theme may have multiple versions, or executions, which are rotated over time. In effect, there is a portfolio of ads that is run in each week. Managers need to understand the individual effects as well as the interaction effects among the different versions of advertising on overall demand. Such an understanding then * Deceased.</p><p>would allow managers to allocate their budgets over multiple themes more effectively. Most of the published research on the impact of advertising themes is categorized under copy research and these studies have employed experiments. They have focused on the effects of different copy on individual consumer attributes such as brand awareness and attitudes toward the brand. The literature that links the copy effects to sales or market share is limited to experimental studies and does not consider wearout effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaker and</ref><ref type="bibr">Carmen 1982, Eastlack and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rao 1989)</ref>.</p><p>The substantial research issues that we address in this study focus on understanding the effects of different themes of advertising on demand and on how to allocate a firm's resources across different themes to improve sales performance. The specific research questions pertinent to the study of the effectiveness of multiple themes in advertising are: How different are the wearout effects for the different themes of advertising? How can researchers accurately assess the magnitude of such wearout effects? What is the nature of interaction between the different themes of ads? For a given advertising budget, what is a more effective way to allocate resources across different advertising themes?</p><p>Bass, Bruce, Majumdar, and Murthi: Wearout Effects of Different Advertising Themes 180 Marketing Science 26(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">179-195, Â© 2007 INFORMS</ref> Our response model extends the model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> to multiple themes of advertising. They estimate a dynamic model of the effect of advertising on consumer awareness, rather than on demand, using Kalman filtering methods. Their model captured decay effects in the presence and absence of advertising and found that a gap in advertising has the effect of restoring ad quality. They also separate out the effects of two different types of wearout: copy wearout and repetition wearout. However, in their paper, they study the effectiveness of a single ad campaign with a single message and do not consider multiple themes of advertising which may be scheduled by the manager for the same product category. Our study generalizes their advertising model to account for multiple thematic executions of advertising. In addition, there are a few other notable differences between the two models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> use brand awareness as the dependent variable while we use a measure of demand which is more managerially useful. We employ a different methodology, Bayesian estimation of a dynamic linear model (DLM) as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref>.</p><p>Our paper makes three contributions. First, we extend earlier research on advertising by developing a generalized model of multiple themes of advertising which are aired concurrently in a given week. Such a model can allow managers to assess the wearout effects of different themes of advertising as well as consider the interaction effects between these different themes. Second, we capture the dynamic effects of different advertising themes as a function of wearout and forgetting. In other words, the parameters of the model are time varying and we are able to capture the dynamic path of these parameters. To do this, we employ Gibbs sampling in estimating the state space model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref>. Two recent papers in marketing have also employed Gibbs sampling in a DLM framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Neelamegham and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chintagunta 2004, Van Heerde et al. 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Leichty et al. (2005)</ref> employed Gibbs sampling to study the dynamic development of consumer preferences in a conjoint application. Finally, we develop a model to help managers conduct a what-if scenario analysis so that they can allocate their resources over different advertising themes more effectively.</p><p>Our data are obtained from a major telecom company that is a monopolist in its category. We have data on demand in terms of calling time, prices per minute of calling, and advertising spending for each of the themes that are defined by the company. A unique aspect of our data is that advertising is measured in gross rating points (GRPs) and not in dollars. One GRP represents advertising exposure to one percent of the population that owns television sets as defined by the ACNielsen TV ratings. There are two advantages of using GRPs instead of advertising dollars. First, GRPs provide a more accurate picture of advertising input than advertising expenditures since it is not clear how much advertising exposure can be purchased for a given budget. Second, most media buying is done in terms of GRPs and managers evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns in terms of demand generated per GRP. The company classifies its advertising into five advertising themes: call stimulation ads, product offer ads, price offer ads, reconnect ads, and reassurance ads. We restrict our attention to these five themes.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Â§2, we provide a brief review of the relevant literature on estimation of advertising response with particular emphasis on wearout and dynamic effects. In Â§3, we present the details of our econometric model. In Â§4, we present the data and discuss the results of our estimation. Finally, we conclude with an overview of findings, the managerial implications, and the limitations of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>We present a brief overview of response models and review the literature on wearout effects and dynamic effects in greater detail. We also present arguments for studying the differences in wearout effects across multiple themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Response Models</head><p>In a seminal paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Little (1979)</ref> stated that aggregate advertising response models should have the following desirable characteristics: (a) the effect of advertising should be nonlinear, (b) the models should capture the dynamic effects of wearout and forgetting, (c) models should consider the effect of competitive advertising, and (d) the ad effects could change over time due to changes in media and copy. Most of the models in the literature have been developed consistent with some, if not all, of these principles.</p><p>Early aggregate advertising response models linked advertising expenditures to sales or market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bass and Clarke 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Blattberg and Jeuland 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Hanssens et al. 1990</ref>) and considered the carryover effects of advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bass and Leone 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Broadbent 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Clarke 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Srinivasan and Weir 1988</ref>. These models used distributed lag models to capture the carry-over effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Clarke (1976)</ref> showed that the magnitude of the effect of advertising and the duration of carry-over effects depended on the data interval used. The response models were then used to appropriate advertising dollars to maximize profits in both monopoly and oligopoly contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Simon 1965</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Nerlove and Arrow 1962</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Telser 1964</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Palda 1964</ref>). These models used aggregate advertising <ref type="bibr">Bass, Bruce, Majumdar, and Murthi: Wearout Effects of Different Advertising Themes Marketing Science 26(2), pp. 179-195, Â© 2007 INFORMS 181</ref> expenditures and did not consider the effect of multiple themes. A good recent review of the advertising literature is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vakratsas and Ambler (1999)</ref>.</p><p>Another stream of research discussed the shape of the advertising response function: whether it is concave or S-shaped. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wittink (1977)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rao and Miller (1975)</ref>, and recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Vakratsas et al. (2005)</ref> found evidence of an S-shaped function while <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon (1969)</ref> found no evidence for the S-shape. This was an important question because the theoretical models showed that the phenomenon of pulsing in advertising was related to the S-shape of the response function <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Simon 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Mahajan and Muller 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Feinberg 1992</ref>. In a recent paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> show that pulsing can occur due to ad copy wearout, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bronnenberg (1998)</ref> shows that pulsing can also occur in the context of a monopolist facing a Markovian sales response function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Wearin and Wearout</head><p>Wearin refers to the positive effect on consumers who are exposed to an ad <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Pechmann and Stewart 1990)</ref>. The term wearout refers to the decay in advertising quality of an ad over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Grass and Wallace 1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Strong 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Calder and Sternthal 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Simon 1982</ref>). An ad is worn out if it either does not have any significant effect on consumers or has a negative effect. Both wearin and wearout effects depend on factors such as whether the ad was based on an emotional appeal or a rational appeal, whether the persuasion in the message was strong or weak, whether consumers were motivated or not to process the ad, and whether the level of competitive ads was high or low <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Pechmann and Stewart 1990)</ref>. The wearout effects may also depend on the change in ad copy. This is based on research that suggests that variations in copy improve the effectiveness or, specifically, recall of ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Grass and Wallace 1969)</ref>.</p><p>In a series of experiments to study of the effects of repetition of ads, <ref type="bibr">Ray and Sawyer (1971a, b)</ref> found that the response functions for repetition varied across different measures (e.g., recall or intention), segments, brands, and type of advertising. They also studied the effect of different messages on repetition functions. Relevant to our study, they found that "grabber" ads were less effective over repetitions (i.e., had higher wearout) than "nongrabber" ads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">MacInnis et al. (2002)</ref> find evidence of a significant positive relationship between ad repetition and sales when emotional ads are employed, but not for rational ads. They argue that one possible explanation of the above finding is that emotional ads have less rapid wearout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> model two sources of wearoutrepetition wearout and copy wearout. When a customer is exposed to ads repeatedly, she can become bored, irritated, or simply lose interest as the benefits of processing the ad are perceived to be worthless <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berlyne 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Greyser 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Weilbacher 1970</ref>. This leads to repetition wearout, which depends on the amount of advertising that is done. Copy wearout, on the other hand, is the decay in advertising effectiveness due to the passage of time, which is independent of the amount of advertising. Such a decay may be the result of a change in consumers' conditions such as increased knowledge about product attributes over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Calantone and Sawyer 1978)</ref>. Other reasons for copy wearout include the imitation of an ad strategy by competing firms or by firms in other product categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Axelrod 1980</ref>) and an increase in ad clutter <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Corkindale and Newall 1978)</ref>. A good discussion of these two effects is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Forgetting</head><p>Another factor that affects quality dynamics is the effect of forgetting. Consumers tend to forget an ad when it is not being aired in a given period. Forgetting has a negative effect by reducing aggregate brand awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mahajan et al. 1984)</ref>. On the other hand, the literature also suggests that there is a rejuvenating effect of advertising when an ad is taken off the media <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Grass and Wallace 1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Greenberg and Suttoni 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Corkindale and Newall 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Naik et al. 1998</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grass and Wallace (1969)</ref> conclude that a period of no advertising enhances consumers' attention to ads. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Calder and Sternthal (1980)</ref> have found that the amount of cognitive responses increases when there is a break in advertising. The argument for improvement in ad quality, when it is not aired for a period of time, is that consumers may forget the particulars of a given ad and may feel that the ad is "fresh" when it is reintroduced. This suggests that as the period that an ad is pulled off the media is increased, there is a corresponding increase in forgetting and a consequent increase in the restoration of ad quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Corkindale and Newall 1978)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Differential Effects of Wearout Across Themes</head><p>As stated earlier, wearout is affected by several factors such as the type of appeal, level of competitive advertising, and strength of persuasion. Experimental evidence shows that emotional ads wearout more slowly than ads based on nonemotional or rational appeals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hitchon et al. 1988)</ref>. In this laboratory study, the dependent variables were attitude toward the ad, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions. The authors found that unemotional ads exhibited faster wearout in all of the three dependent variables when compared to emotional ads. This could be due to the fact that ads with emotional images elicit imagery processing while verbal arguments elicit cognitive processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(MacInnis and Price 1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silk and Vavra (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ray and Sawyer (1971b)</ref> also suggest that "soft sell" ads, which use emotional images, wear out slower Marketing Science 26(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">179-195, Â© 2007 INFORMS</ref> than "hard sell" ads, which are based on verbal arguments. These arguments highlight the need for studying the differential wearout effects of different themes of advertising and their effect on demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Need for Time-Varying Coefficients</head><p>Advertising effects accumulate over time, hence it is reasonable to expect that the response coefficients will also vary over time. Researchers have modeled the phenomenon of time-varying parameters using data from different time periods and estimating a separate coefficient for each time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Winer 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Bronnenberg et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Mela et al. 1997</ref>. Since only a part of the data is used in each estimation, these estimates are likely to be inefficient.</p><p>Other researchers have employed a random coefficients approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jedidi et al. 1999)</ref> where the parameter is assumed to be distributed according to a probability distribution over time. In these models, the variance of the distribution is estimated; thus researchers are able to control for the time-varying nature of the response parameters but are unable to recover the parameter paths over time. The model used in our research, the dynamic linear model (DLM), is able to estimate the dynamic path of the response coefficient over time and the estimates are efficient.</p><p>In a recent paper, DubÃ© and Manchanda ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>) study the differences in dynamics of marketing mix (price and advertising) across several markets. They conclude that a firm's current and past advertising has a larger effect on its own demand, especially in larger markets. They also conclude that competitors' advertising has a much smaller effect on a firm's demand than the firm's own advertising. This work suggests that ignoring competitive advertising while modeling a firm's advertising-to-sales relationship is unlikely to cause serious error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Need for Interactions</head><p>The interaction effects between advertising and other marketing mix variables, especially price, have been well-documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eskin and Baron 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Wittink 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Krishnamurthi and Raj 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, Winer and Moore 1989</ref>. Therefore, it is necessary to model the interaction between the different themes of advertising as well. A recent paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Naik et al. (2005)</ref> makes a strong case for modeling interactions between advertising and promotions in developing demand models in a competitive environment. In sum, our paper extends the literature on advertising response models by considering wearout effects, interaction effects, and dynamic effects of different themes of advertising while being consistent with prior research guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Montgomery et al. (2005)</ref> use a survey to provide evidence that managers, when making decisions, place considerably less weight on competitive reactions and strategic competitive reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model</head><p>We develop a model of advertising that links demand to the advertising expenditure that is incurred in airing multiple themes of advertising in a given week. Since advertising effects last longer than a week, we can assume that multiple themes are being aired concurrently. The model should consider the dynamic effects of wearout and forgetting as described earlier.</p><p>We begin by generalizing the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref>, who estimate a model that links awareness to the advertising expenditure data. Though they estimated a number of advertising models that have been proposed in the marketing literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nerlove and Arrow (1962)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vidale and Wolfe (1957)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Little (1975)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Blattberg and Golanty (1978)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blackburn and Clancy (1982)</ref>, they find that the Nerlove-Arrow model provides them the best fit. Given this information, we focus our attention in this paper on the Nerlove-Arrow model.</p><p>In the Nerlove-Arrow model, the rate of change in goodwill G t is a function of the advertising expenditure per week A t that can be measured either in terms of gross rating points (GRP) or in dollars. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dG t dt = qA t â G t (1)</formula><p>where q = effectiveness of ad spending (assumed constant, set equal to one in Nerlove-Arrow). = rate of decay of goodwill due to forgetting. A t = advertising spending in each time period t. G t = goodwill in each time period.</p><p>More generally, one can use a function of advertising expenditure f A t , which need not be linear as in the Nerlove-Arrow model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> extend the above model by making the advertising effectiveness parameter q to be time dependent. In other words, q is not assumed to be constant over time, but is a function of time as well as advertising expenditure. The rationale for such an approach is that it allows the capture of different types of wearout effects-copy wearout and repetition wearout. Copy wearout refers to the decay in advertising effectiveness over time due to the message becoming less effective, and this effect is assumed to be independent of the amount of advertising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> point out that copy wearout can occur due to several reasons: (1) the consumer becomes more knowledgeable about the product attributes, (2) the amount of competitive advertising in response to this firm's advertising can reduce attention, or (3) other firms imitate the advertising style. Repetition wearout, on the other hand, depends on the amount of advertising expenditure and occurs because consumers get bored of seeing the same ad or perceive the value of processing the ad a second time as being small. The greater the amount of advertising, the greater is the repetition wearout effect.</p><p>To describe the evolution of the effectiveness parameter q over time, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> propose a differential equation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dq dt = âa A q + 1 â I A 1 â q (2)</formula><p>where a A = c + wA t (3) c is the copy wearout parameter and w is the repetition wearout parameter.</p><p>In the above equations, there are two types of effects. When the advertising is "on" in a given time period, the indicator function I A takes the value = 1 and the second term on the RHS of Equation (2) becomes zero. The effect of advertising is captured by copy wearout parameter c and repetition wearout parameter w in Equation ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>). Note that repetition wearout depends on advertising level A t . When advertising is "off," there is a rejuvenating effect of advertising that is captured by the second term on the RHS of Equation (2).</p><p>We now generalize the Nerlove-Arrow and Naik models to accommodate multiple ad themes. A different combination of ad themes is aired in each week. We model the ad spending rate in Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) as an additive function of ad spending on individual themes. The modified equation of the rate of change in goodwill is given by a generalization of the Nerlove-Arrow model for advertising themes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dG dt = m i=1 q i g A i + i m j=1 j =i h A i A j â G (4)</formula><p>where q i is the effectiveness of ad theme i, g A i is a function of the advertising expenditure for theme i, m is the number of ad themes, G is the goodwill, and A i is the advertising expenditure for each ad theme. Note that both goodwill and advertising vary over time. Because of availability of data on several ad themes, we are able to understand the interaction effects among the different themes. The term</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">i m j=1 j =i h A i A j</formula><p>is an interaction effect for the ith theme. We estimate a separate interaction effects parameter i for each theme, thus allowing for possible asymmetric effects.</p><p>It is an overall measure of how the ith theme interacts with all other concurrent advertising themes at time t. We suppress the notation for time for ease of exposition. One can potentially estimate interaction param-eters for all pairwise combinations of ad themes, but we estimate only one coefficient for each theme for the sake of parsimony. Furthermore, we have no theory to explain the nature of pairwise interactions, which could depend on the nature of ad themes and their execution.</p><p>In the estimation, we use g A i = ln 1 + A i and h A i A j = ln 1 + A i ln 1 + A j . The justification for use of the semilog specification has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Doyle and Saunders (1990)</ref>. They rule out linear and exponential functional forms as they do not exhibit diminishing returns, which is a characteristic of advertising response models <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Simon 1970)</ref>. Polynomial functions exhibit supersaturation and do not fare well in optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Doyle and Saunders 1990)</ref>. The semilog specification has also been favored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lambin (1969)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carroll et al. (1979)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jagpal et al. (1979)</ref> also recommend using a log-log specification and consider the interaction term as the product of two ln A i terms as we have done.</p><p>The change in ad effectiveness q i is given by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dq i dt = âa A i q i + 1 â I A i 1 â q i i = 1 2 m (5)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a A i = c i + w i A it (6)</formula><p>Note that there are five different equations for Equation (5), one for each advertising theme. Further, for tractability we assume that the rate of change in ad quality for the ad themes dq i /dt are independent of each other. There is some support for the assumption of independence in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blair and Rabuck (1998)</ref>. Based on an analysis of over 500 case studies they conclude that commercials within a campaign wear out independently of their pool partners. Even though there may be similarities between some ad themes which could be modeled, such a dependency would complicate the estimation of the dynamic parameters in our model. We therefore leave the modeling of such dependencies between ad themes for future research.</p><p>Thus, our model allows for the estimation of dynamic effects of advertising themes in the presence of wearout effects. We control for cross-sectional heterogeneity between the ad themes by estimating separate dynamic parameters for each ad theme. We employ the Gibbs sampler for estimation of our parameters, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref>. There are two advantages of using a DLM model. First, we are able to provide an understanding of how the response parameters themselves change over time. To understand the differences in advertising effectiveness of two different ad themes, it is not enough to observe differences in mean parameter values because even Marketing Science 26(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">179-195, Â© 2007 INFORMS</ref> if the average effect of a particular response coefficient may be the same across two advertising themes, their parameter paths may be substantially different over time. Other researchers have employed a random coefficients specification to model time-varying parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jedidi et al. 1999)</ref>. Such models can control for the time-varying nature of parameters but do not provide an estimate of the parameter at a given point in time. DLM also handles missing observations in a trivial manner as no updating takes place.</p><p>Second, advertising response may be nonstationary. In time-series analysis, researchers filter the data (say, by taking first-or higher-order differences) in order to make the series stationary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref> point out that these filtering methods affect the interpretation of the model by confounding different model components. Further sources of nonstationarity that deviate from the process implied by the filter are not captured. They suggest that DLM presents a better method for handling nonstationarity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data</head><p>We obtained data for a major telecommunications services company in which the demand for residential telephone services has been measured in two We have used the total call time in millions of hours as our dependent variable. We aggregated demand for three call types-local, regional, and nationaleach of which are classified as weekday and weekend calls. We have not considered international calls.</p><p>The covariates that are available to model demand are the average price per minute of a call, the number of land lines available, and competitive advertising. We compute the weighted average price per minute over the different categories that we considered since the rates are different for these categories. In addition, we have data on the number of lines available to account for the increase in capacity over the 114 weeks under study. Note that the telecommunications company is a monopoly in the land line telecommunications business and competition exists only in the wireless markets. We group all competitive advertising expenditures into one category.</p><p>The company classifies its advertising into five themes-call stimulation ads, product offer ads, price offer ads, reconnect ads, and reassurance ads. Advertising expenditure for each theme of advertising is measured in terms of gross rating points (GRP). Advertising GRPs of different themes of advertising are available for a period of 114 weeks between 1995 and 1997. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we provide plots of GRPs for different advertising themes as well as for total GRP of competitive ads over the 114-week period. The total amount of GRP across all themes for the firm is given in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

We assume these omitted demand factors are perceived by the firm and can influence price, suggesting a potential endogeneity problem (Villas-Boas and Winer 1999). Therefore, we use instruments W to address this problem. We used retail price index, number of households, consumer sentiment, and household spending as instruments in addition to competitive advertising and number of lines:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p t = p t W + t (8)</formula><p>Another source of endogeneity bias could be due to the assumption of advertising GRP as an exogenous variable. If firms choose the level of advertising strategically (say, in response to competitors' advertising), then these variables are endogenous. This potential endogeneity bias could be mitigated if we had good instruments in our data. We leave the study of endoeneity bias as an issue for future research.

As shown above, t is the state vector whose first element is goodwill and remaining elements are m = 5 advertising qualities, one for each theme during time t. The m + 1 Ã m + 1 transition matrix H t captures the time-varying effects of ad spending, wearout, and forgetting on the portfolio of advertising themes and goodwill across time. The constant vector F t reflects the impact of goodwill on telephone usage. Error terms w t and t are assumed to be mean-zero independent normals. Thus, we can rewrite Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) in a more compact notation to obtain the  standard Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">y t = F t t + X t + t (11) t = H t tâ1 + u t + w t where t â¼ N 0 2 w t â¼ N 0 W (12)</formula><p>Gathering the parameters of the model together in a tuple constitutes the DLM specification F t H t 2 W . The model is then completed with specifications of: (i) prior distributions for the unobserved elements of the transition matrix H t , , c i w i i m i=1 , (ii) prior distributions for , the coefficient of other independent measures that affect the demand for telephone services, (iii) prior distributions for unobserved observation and system variances 2 and W, and (iv) initial guess for the state vector of containing goodwill and advertising quality 0 at time t = 0 based on initial information denoted by D 0 . We will assume standard conjugate forms for all priors in our analysis. Prior specifications are chosen to allow the data to dominate the results.</p><p>While many state space methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harvey 1994</ref>) rely on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for estimation, the DLM is based on Bayesian estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison (1997)</ref> suggest the use of traditional Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) techniques such as Gibbs sampling. There are several reasons why the DLM is particularly suited to studying time-varying advertising effects. Relative to the static Bayesian models seen in the marketing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allenby and Rossi 2003)</ref>, the DLM offers improved estimation via adaptation and Bayesian learning. Moreover, with suitable informative priors, relatively accurate forecasts can be produced from series too short for purely data driven (frequentist) analyses.</p><p>We estimate the above system of discrete Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and (10) by specifying priors for the model parameters and using MCMC simulation of the full posterior based on the entire data series t = 1 2 T . Let T = 0 1 2 T and y T = y 1 y 2 y T be the state parameters and telephone usage over the entire data set. Let = c i w i i m i=1 be a vector of forgetting, wearout, and interaction parameters defined in H t , and the coefficient for other explanatory variables that influence telephone usage. Now assume that the prior on 2 is inverse gamma and the prior on W is independent inverse Wishart. Then, by using a direct Gibbs sampling approach (Gelfand and Smith 1990), we can compute the complete joint posterior p T W 2 y T , iteratively resampling conditional posteriors p T y T 2 W and p W 2 t y T (see Appendix A for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Model Identification</head><p>To show identification in our DLM, we need to investigate whether enough prior structure exists in the system of Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>). First, we need to construct an observationally equivalent system M 1 = F 1t H 1t 2 W 1 , where observability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Crassidis and Junkins 2004)</ref> relates to our ability to recover all state vectors T = 0 1 2 T given observations y T = y 1 y 2 y T . An equivalent system is achieved by substituting the linear transformation 1t = L t into Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), where L t is a m + 1 Ã m + 1 nonsingular matrix. We obtain F 1t = F t L â1 , H 1t = LH t L â1 , u 1t = Lu t , and W 1 = LWL . Under this transformation, the model M 1 is indistinguishable from our system described in Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and (12). Thus, for identification it is sufficient to show that enough prior structure exists in F t and H t such that all transformations are precluded except L = I (the identity matrix). It turns out that L = I for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> and our model (see Appendix B for a proof).</p><p>Finally, for the incorporation of price endogeneity, we take a two-step approach. In the first step, we estimate a Bayesian regression model with all the exogenous variables and instruments as independent variables. In the second step, we replace prices in the For comparison, we also implemented a fully Bayesian instrumental variable procedure given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rossi et al. (2005)</ref>. Their approach is different from that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lancaster (2004)</ref>. An important distinction between these two treatments is the specification of the prior on the covariance matrix of the reduced form errors. This matrix is a function of the coefficient of the endogenous variable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lancaster (2004)</ref> assumes that the prior is independent of the coefficient of the endogenous variable while <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rossi et al. (2005)</ref> do not, which we believe is more reasonable. We find that our substantive results were unchanged. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>We report the results of our estimation in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3  to 9</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, we provide values of the log Bayes factors for comparing the model fits across alternate models. In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4 and 5</ref>, we provide estimates of our complete model with interactions between different themes. We also estimate a model in which there are no interaction effects between the different ad themes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>). To compare the results, we estimate another model in which we aggregate the advertising expenditures of different themes and treat the demand as a function of total advertising GRPs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref>).</p><p>To compare model fit across two models that differ in parameters, we employ Bayes factors or log Bayes factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(West and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harrison 1997, Congdon 2001)</ref>. A log Bayes factor of one or greater indicates evidence in favor of our model. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>(a), we see that a model with no advertising interactions is rejected in favor of a model with advertising interactions. Similarly, a model that considers aggregate advertising GRPs across the different themes as a dependent variable is also rejected in favor of our proposed model; this highlights the value of modeling different responses for different advertising themes. We also reject the linear and square root functional forms for g A it in favor of the ln A it specification.</p><p>We also compare the predictive performance of alternate models and compute the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean square error (MSE) between predictions of demand from the model and the actual demand. In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3(b</ref>) and 3(c), we compute MAD and MSE using data from all 114 weeks and use the parameters to predict demand for 1 to 114 weeks and 51 to 114 weeks. The MAD and MSE values in both sections are the lowest for the full model with interactions. We also provide out-of-sample forecast performance of alternate models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3(</ref> <ref type="bibr">d)</ref>. We estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and (10) using two sample timeframes (t = 1 60, and t = 1 100) and generate outof-sample (step ahead) forecasts for 10 time periods k = 1 2 3 10. We report MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) across the k = 10 time periods for all model forecasts. The evidence clearly supports the predictive performance of our proposed model.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, we present the estimates of our model and we see that the effect of price per minute on demand is negative. To obtain an understanding of the significance level, we report the 95% HPDI (highest probability density interval). We note that price per minute has a significant effect on demand at 95% confidence level. Further, capacity as measured by the number of lines also has a significant positive effect on demand, while competitive advertising has a negative but nonsignificant effect on demand. The lack of an effect due to competition may be due to the fact the firm is dominant in its category. These effects are consistent with our expectations. The forgetting rate is 0.034, significant and consistent with values obtained in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Naik et al. 1998)</ref>. This means that when an ad is taken off consumers tend to forget the message and this could lead to an enhancement in quality of the ad when it is aired again after some time. The copy wearout effects c are all positive and significant. The coefficients are different for different themes and range from a low value of 0.1625 for reassurance ads to 0.5725 for price offer ads. This suggests that price offer ads have a higher   rate of copy wearout than that of reassurance ads. We provide a discussion of these parameters later.</p><p>We find that the repetition wearout effects are negative and significantly different from zero. For instance, the repetition wearout effect for call stimulation ad is â0 0329. This suggests that there is no repetition wearout, but in fact there is wearin. It is important to note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> obtain positive and significant effects for repetition wearout while we get significant negative coefficients. This may be explained by the fact that the firm employed different themes and multiple executions within each theme. This rotation of ads across different themes could have the effect of keeping the ads fresh and may explain the wearin effect of advertising. This is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lodish et al. (1995)</ref>, in which they conducted a metaanalysis of a large number of split cable television experiments and concluded that an increase in sales due to an increase in media weight is more likely when copy strategy is changed. So while repeating the same ad might cause wearout, having different executions of the same message may contribute to a wearin.</p><p>Research in laboratory experiments also indicates that repeated ads using multiple executions lead to better recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Unnava and Burnkrant 1991)</ref>. Our results on wearout differ from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> and demonstrate the importance of considering the effect of different themes in obtaining correct wearout effects.</p><p>To understand the reason for differences in copy effects between different themes, we draw on the findings in the review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pechmann and Stewart (1990)</ref>. They suggest that emotional ads and ads with greater emotional imagery wear out slower than ads without emotional persuasion. We conduct an informal analysis of this argument as we do not have information about the actual content. We speculate that price and product offer ads have a more rational appeal and we suspect that call stimulation, reassurance, and reconnect ads have a greater emotional appeal. Based on this classification, we see in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> that rational ads have larger copy wearout parameters than emotional ads. These findings are consistent with the research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hitchon et al. (1988)</ref> and the verbal arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Silk and Vavra (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ray and Sawyer (1971)</ref> which suggest that "hard sell" ads wear out faster than "soft sell" ads.</p><p>Further, the literature review posits that wearout can be mitigated by using a number of different copy executions. We show the number of executions for each theme and the repetition wearout parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>. Within the category of rational ads, we see that as the number of executions increases, the repetition wearout decreases. We do not find the same  pattern within the category of emotional appeal ads; however, if we take the average number of executions across rational and emotional ads, there is a link between the number of copy executions and wearin. As the number of copy executions increases, the wearin is higher (i.e., wearout is lower). While these conclusions are not definitive evidence, they are consistent with what researchers have observed in laboratory settings and provide validity to our model and estimation. Note that the above analysis is based on our ad hoc classification of ads as either rational or emotional.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, we present the interaction effects of the various themes. We find that all the interaction coefficients are negative, and the interactions of call stimulation, reconnection, and reassurance ads are statistically significantly different from zero. Note that in our model we assume that the interaction of, say, a call stimulation ad with all other ads has the same coefficient. The negative parameters suggest that the interaction between the different themes mitigates the goodwill generated by the ad campaign. There is considerable evidence for negative interaction effects even among noncompeting advertisements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Calder and Sternthal (1980)</ref> show that when subjects are repeatedly exposed to an ad embedded in a collection of commercials over a period of time, they have negative evaluations of the ad and the associated product. Attention to a specific message theme is theorized to diminish if the message is dominated by a clutter of other message themes. Moreover, there is evidence that the persuasive impact of advertising is much less reliable when a target ad is presented in an environment that includes other ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Belch 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Burke and Srull 1988</ref><ref type="bibr">, Ray and Sawyer 1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Rethans et al. 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Malaviya et al. 1999</ref>. It is interesting to see that both price ads and product offer ads with rational appeal do not have significant interaction effects. This may be suggesting that attention to rational price offer or product offer messages is less diminished by message clutter. Emotional ads appear to have negative interaction effects on goodwill even though they reduce wearout.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, we present the estimates of our model without interaction effects. We find that this model is rejected by log Bayes factor criterion. The copy wearout and repetition wearout effects are consistent with those in the earlier model. We find that rational ads do have faster copy wearout but slower repetition wearin. The forgetting parameter is 0.0784, significant and higher than that obtained earlier. In fact, without the interaction terms all the wearout effects are larger in magnitude, thus suggesting bias if one does not capture these interaction effects. The magnitude of the bias averages 58% with a range from 21% to 146%.  In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref>, we present estimates of our model using aggregate advertising GRP instead of considering the GRP of the different themes separately. Using log Bayes factor (87.712), we can reject this model in favor of our proposed model. We find that the effect of price, competitive advertising, and capacity are consistent with earlier results. In the aggregate model, we find that the forgetting rate is 0.93, which is very high compared to estimates obtained in the above models as well as the estimates obtained in earlier studies. Note that the forgetting parameter is identified by periods when there is no advertising. When we add up the GRPs of all themes of ads (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), there are very few weeks in which there is no advertising. Thus, the aggregate model will provide a biased estimate. We find the copy wearout parameter is negative and the repetition wearout parameter is positive. These results suggest that when there are multiple themes being advertised, an aggregate model might provide misleading interpretation.  Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the evolution of the goodwill parameter G t and the five quality parameters q it .</p><p>To provide a measure of the model's predictive performance, we use the parameters from our proposed model in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> and predict the number of hours of talk time. The plot of predicted versus actual hours of talk time is given in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The plot indicates a very good fit of the model with the data across 114 weeks. The predicted values track the variations in actual data quite closely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Advertising Policy Implications</head><p>Given our estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, we can reconsider the advertiser's budget allocation decisions across the five advertising themes. For example, we estimated that over the 114-week period of our sample, price and product ads had the two highest copy wearout estimates but the lowest repetition wearouts. On the other hand, reconnection and reassurance advertising themes had the lowest copy wearouts and call stimulation and reassurance had the highest repetition wearouts. What are the implications of these results on budget allocation in each of the 114 weeks? More importantly, could the advertising have been more efficient in generating greater demand for telephone services?</p><p>To answer the above questions, we develop a model to reallocate the total advertising GRPs b t in each period across the five m = 5 ad themes to maximize total expected telephone service demand over 114 weeks. We solve the following large-scale nonlinear optimization problem P1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">max A 11 â¢â¢â¢A 1m â¢â¢â¢A T 1 â¢â¢â¢A Tm T t=1 E y t D tâ1 s.t. m i=1 A it â¤ b t A it â¥ 0 t = 1 T Var y t D tâ1 â¤ 2 t t = 1 T</formula><p>where E y t D tâ1 and Var y t D tâ1 are the expectation and variance of the one-step-ahead forecast distribution (see Appendix A, Equation <ref type="formula">A3</ref>) and A it the GRP for an ad theme at time t. Thus, we solve a program that involves 570 5 Ã 114 variables and 114 (114 weeks) linear constraints. The problem (P1) is solved in SNOPT, a set of Fortran routines developed by Stanford Optimization Laboratory. These routines are called within MAT-LAB. SNOPT is a general purpose system for solving optimization problems involving many variables and constraints, and so is particularly suited for our problem. It uses a sequential quadratic programming algorithm that obtains search directions from a sequence of quadratic programming subproblems <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gill et al. 2002)</ref>. Given the size of the problem it solves, SNOPT finds solutions that are locally optimal and, ideally, any nonlinear objective functions should be smooth. We use multiple start values and choose solutions that give allocations that represent an improvement in advertising efficiency. We caution the readers that the solution may not be optimal but provides a better allocation.</p><p>One such allocation is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref> and depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The horizontal bar graph compares the "improved" and the actual allocation of resources (measured in total GRPs) across the different themes. Our model suggests increasing advertising expenditure on reconnect and reassurance ads while decreasing on the other three themes. The percentage changes in allocation of GRPs are quite large as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">9</ref>. They range from a low of 50% to a high of 276% change.</p><p>A reallocation of advertising along the suggested lines would generate an additional 35.82 million hours of calling time which represents a 2% increase over the current level of demand. We thus demonstrate how our model can be used to reallocate resources over different themes to improve the desired outcome, whether it is awareness as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> or demand as in our case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have developed a model of demand that considers the dynamic effects of multiple themes of television advertising. We believe that this is a first attempt to help managers allocate their advertising resources across different themes of advertising. The model considers wearout effects-both copy wearout and repetition wearout-as well as forgetting. Advertising is assumed to affect goodwill which in turn affects demand for a product or a service. A modification of the Nerlove-Arrow specification is employed because it has been shown to perform the best <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Naik et al. 1998)</ref>. Our model extends the specification in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> by considering the evolution of goodwill and advertising effectiveness over time for Reassure ads 95% HPDI different ad themes. Further, we employ dynamic linear Bayesian estimation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(West and Harrison 1997)</ref>, a relatively new method, to estimate our model parameters. We also develop a model to show how reallocation of resources can be done using the parameters of our proposed model. We find that modeling different advertising efforts on different themes yields better insights and unbiased estimates relative to a model that aggregates the advertising effort. We find that copy wearout effects of different themes are positive and systematically different. Based on our ad hoc classification of ad themes as either emotional or rational ads, we find some support for the premise proposed in behavioral literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Pechmann and Stewart 1990</ref>) that emotional ads tend to wear out faster than nonemotional ads. Repetition wearout parameters are negative, suggesting wearin effects for this data. We find some evidence that repetition wearout is lower if the number of copy executions is higher.</p><p>Thus, changing the execution of the message appears to refresh the message and mitigates wearout. There is evidence of positive forgetting effects when there is no advertising. Thus, our model is consistent with earlier findings on the effects of advertising with repetition. The main value of our model comes from the fact that we have linked demand to the wearout and forgetting effects and so have provided a way for managers to use these parameters and insights in making allocation decisions. Our policy experiment suggests that a reallocation of advertising effort across the different themes could result in a higher payoff. There are a few limitations of our model. In the proposed model, we assume that advertising is an exogenous variable. Since managers allocate advertising in a strategic manner, one can make a case that it should be treated as an endogenous variable as we have done for price. This control for the endogeneity of advertising can be modeled if good instruments were available in the data. We have not considered the dynamic effects of competitive advertising, which could be modeled analogous to the different themes. Given data on competitors' demand, this extension can be attempted in future research. In our data, the firm is a monopolist in its business and so we have not modeled competition explicitly. In other product categories, this would be an area for future research.</p><p>Our model can be extended to account for changes in copy and a model can be developed for allocation of resources across different copy. This is a challenging problem since the number of executions even for a given theme can be large and one needs  to also find a way to incorporate content of advertising into the model. Other avenues for future research are to extend our model to develop a media allocation model and to also consider the interaction between different themes and different media. These are important issues and our paper presents a possible starting point to address them.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Plot of GRPs for Different Themes Over Time</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A</head><p>This appendix provides an overview of the posterior sampling algorithm. The sampling scheme shown in Â§A.1 is direct application of DLM theory <ref type="bibr">(West and Harrison 1997, Chapter 4)</ref> and Gibbs sampling for state space models developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Carter and Kohn (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fruhwirth-Schnatter (1994)</ref>. Our model belongs to the class of linear state space models in which components of the transition matrix H t and the variance components 2 W are treated as parameters to be estimated along with the sequence of state vectors t over time. We begin the forward filtering step with the most recent values of m 0 , C o , W, 2 , , and :</p><p>A.1. Sampling from p t D t Forward Filtering. We use the standard DLM framework (Equations A1 through A5) to infer the posterior distribution t D t over time, where D t = y t D tâ1 includes all information available to the researcher at time t. The posterior t D t is then determined using standard mutivariate normal theory: Backward Smoothing. We derive the backward smoothing algorithm by using (A1) through (A2) to write down the joint distribution of the parameters at t and t â 1, given information D tâ1 to obtain Equation (A6):</p><p>Then, using standard multivariate normal theory, we obtain the conditionals:</p><p>and t is a random draw from the posterior N t D t .</p><p>We can now do a retrospective analysis using results derived in Equations ( <ref type="formula">A6</ref>) and (A7). That is, we take expectations and variance over all possible draws of the posterior of t given information at time t, D t . In other words, at any time (say, t â 1) in the analysis the researcher can update his posterior belief about the effects of advertising spending given his new information at time t. The result is our backward smoothing algorithm:</p><p>and</p><p>We use the above (Equations A1 through A9) to sample the state vector of goodwill and advertising copy quality as follows:</p><p>T , compute the moments m t C t for the multivariate normal p t D t 2 W by applying the sequential updating procedure described in the above forward filter section (Equations A2, A3, and A5).</p><p>Step 2. At the end of the series t = T , sample T from the posterior distribution:</p><p>Step 3. For t = T 1, sample p tâ1 t 2 W conditional on the latest draw t .</p><p>The results are the draws</p><p>from the full conditional posterior.</p><p>A.2. Sampling from p W 2 T y T Conditional on all the states and the data T y T , our DLM Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) simplify to a linear multivariate system with unknowns, parameters , and variance components W 2 . Consequently, the Gibbs sampler step to estimate the joint posterior of the nonstate parameters conditional on the data and all states p W 2 T y T is very straightforward. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gelfand and Smith (1990)</ref> for an overview. For the interested reader, we note several DLM features that highlight the simplicity of this step:</p><p>(1) The observation Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and system Equation (10) errors are mutually independent (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">West and Harrison 1997)</ref>. Thus, conditional on , we can sample W 2 independently.</p><p>(2) Similarly, conditional on T y T , the states and the data are independent and are thus sampled separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B</head><p>To show identification in our DLM, we need to investigate whether enough prior structure exists in the system of Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>). First, we need to construct an observationally equivalent system M 1 = F 1t H 1t 2 W 1 , where observability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Crassidis and Junkins 2004)</ref> relates to our ability to recover all state vectors T = 0 1 2 T , given observations y T = y 1 y 2 y T . An equivalent system is achieved by substituting the linear transformation 1t = L t into Equations ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), where L t is a m + 1 Ã m + 1 nonsingular matrix <ref type="bibr">(West and Harrison 1997, Chapter 4)</ref>. Thus, we have:</p><p>We illustrate identification for a model with a single message theme (i.e., m = 1; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. 1998</ref>). We will show that enough prior structure exists in F t and H t such that all transformations are precluded except L = I. The results generalize to the multitheme case. Define the nonsingular matrix</p><p>and recall and note constraints in F t Equations (11).</p><p>From Equation (B1) we have</p><p>Thus, l 11 = 1, l 12 = 0, and l 22 = 0 (L is nonsingular). Now, recall and note the constraints in the system matrix H t from Equation ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), when advertising is off I A = 0. From Equation (B2), we have:</p><p>By inspection, H 1t = H t and l 21 = 0. Given our specification of the quality evolution ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and H 1t = H t , we must have u 1t = Lu t and as a result, l 22 = 1. That is, enough prior structure exists in F t and G t such that all transformations are precluded except L = I. QED Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naik et al. (1998)</ref> is a model of pulsing. We now consider identification if this model was applied to situations in which there is no pulsing I A = 1: l 22 w 21 l 2 22 w 22 Identification can be achieved if we restrict the system variance diagonal to be equal, giving l 22 = 1 or l 22 = â1. We reject l 22 = â1 since this implies H 1t 1 1 &lt; 0, which is impossible given the constraint in H t 1 1 &gt; 0. Thus, we have L = I. QED Note that imposing the above constraint leads to model identification.</p></div>			</div>
