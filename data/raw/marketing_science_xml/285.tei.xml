<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The position auction, typically a generalized secondprice auction, is the dominant format used by online publishers, such as search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, and Bing), social media (e.g., Facebook and LinkedIn), and media websites (e.g., <ref type="bibr">CNN.com and Fox.com)</ref>, to allocate advertising space in ranked listings. Advertisers are ranked in ad listings according to their bids; the highest bids receive the best ranks. Advertisers also pay a cost-per-click (CPC), which is determined by the bid of the subsequently ranked advertiser. An advertiser's total online advertising cost, however, depends not just on the CPC, but also on the volume of clicks made throughout the duration of the listing.</p><p>In these online bidding environments, which can generate thousands of clicks on high-traffic publishers, marketers can inadvertently spend more than they budgeted for online advertising. To help marketers control their ad spending, publishers require every advertiser to indicate the daily budget for each auction. This budget is the maximum amount of money the advertiser can spend in one day on a given position auction. If an advertiser's daily budget is depleted before the end of the day, she is removed from the listing and all lower-ranked advertisers move up one position.</p><p>Any advertiser who ascends in position correspondingly sees an improvement in her click-through rate (CTR), but still pays her original CPC. Theoretically, this feature may induce an advertiser to strategically bid in a way that raises the cost of the advertiser ranked just above her, deplete the above-ranked advertiser's budget, and subsequently move into a higher slot. Indeed, according to industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stokes 2010</ref>) and academic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lahaie 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Ganchev et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Zhou and Lukose 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Iyengar et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Bu et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, and Zhang and Feng 2011</ref> accounts, some advertisers bid aggressively with the explicit aim of depleting the budget of higher-ranked advertisers. Thus, in a position auction with budgetconstrained advertisers, there is a fundamental connection between an advertiser's choice of bid and the budget constraints of rival advertisers. This connection, between budgets and equilibrium bids, raises two questions about the impact of advertisers' budgets on their profits and on the publisher's revenue.</p><p>First, how does the size of an advertiser's budget affect its profit? Intuitively, a larger budget should bring more clicks and therefore higher profits. Yet <ref type="bibr">Lu, Zhu, and</ref> Dukes: Position Auctions with Budget Constraints</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>898</head><p>Marketing Science 34(6), pp. <ref type="bibr">897-905, © 2015 INFORMS</ref> this intuition can break down due to the connection between budgets and equilibrium bids mentioned above. In fact, an advertiser's bid can, in equilibrium, be a function of her rival's budget. To illustrate, suppose advertiser i is ranked just above advertiser j. If i's budget is insufficient to remain in a higher position, then j can target her bid to the budget of i to ensure that she eventually drives i out of the ad listing. In this case, advertiser i's CPC, which equals advertiser j's bid, increases in i's budget. Advertiser i's profit can, therefore, decrease as her budget increases. We call this situation a budget trap and identify the conditions under which it occurs.</p><p>The second question we address is: How do advertisers' budgets affect the publisher's revenue? We find that, in some situations, an advertiser with a larger budget will spend (weakly) more in the auction, which leads to (weakly) more revenue for the publisher. Yet in other situations, the opposite can occur. As noted above, an advertiser may bid aggressively to deplete a small daily budget of a higher-ranked advertiser. However, if the higher-ranked advertiser's budget increases beyond a certain level, the lowerranked advertiser will relax her bid because she has no chance of ascending in position. This suggests that an increase in an advertiser's budget can actually lower her CPC in equilibrium, thereby reducing the publisher's revenue. This result is important in light of Google's practice of offering credit services to help small-and medium-sized advertisers expand their budgets. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> This article adds to the growing literature on position auctions. Previous analytical studies have examined various topics such as firms' bidding strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Edelman et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Varian 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Börgers et al. 2013</ref>, the interplay between organic and sponsored links <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Katona and Sarvary 2010)</ref>, linking consumers' search patterns to advertisers' bidding strategies <ref type="bibr">He 2011, Athey and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ellison 2011)</ref>, the impact of uncertainty on bids <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Athey and Nekipelov 2012)</ref>, new pricing metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhu and Wilbur 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Dellarocas 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Liu and Viswanathan 2014</ref>, fraudulent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wilbur and Zhu 2009)</ref>, the effect of quality on advertising performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Even-Dar et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Jerath et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Feng and Xie 2012</ref>, the integration of advertising auctions and price competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Xu et al. 2011)</ref>, buying a competitor's keyword <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desai et al. 2014)</ref>, and cyclical bidding patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zhang and Feng 2011)</ref>. There is also a burgeoning empirical literature on paid-search advertising, which is often sold through position auctions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ghose and Yang 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Rutz and Bucklin 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Yao and Mela 2011</ref> Exclusive: Google offers credit card to advertisers.

A common feature of these studies is that they did not account for firms' budget constraints in position auctions. By introducing budget constraints into a comprehensive equilibrium analysis, we find significant strategic considerations for advertisers' bidding decisions. To our knowledge, these considerations have not been identified in earlier work.</p><p>Recent research has recognized the implications of budget constraints for strategies in position auctions. 2 3 One of the first articles to introduce budget constraints for advertisers in position auctions is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abhishek and Hosanagar (2013)</ref>. This article is aimed at helping advertisers determine an optimal bid strategy across multiple keywords for a given budget. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sayedi et al. (2014)</ref> studied advertisers' poaching behavior between online and offline channels under a fixed advertising budget. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amaldoss et al. (2015)</ref> found that search engines can benefit from the firstpage bid estimate when a high-value advertiser has a limited budget. In contrast to the above-mentioned research, we examine how the depletion of daily budgets affects an advertiser's exit from the listing as well as the corresponding aspects of strategic bidding.</p><p>Our article is closest to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shin (2015)</ref>, who independently examines the strategic aspects of budget constraints in position auctions. However, our study differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shin (2015)</ref> in terms of research focus and modeling approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shin's (2015)</ref> objective is to understand how the presence of budget constraints implies differences in positions and bidding behavior found in the previous literature. He examines a model with multiple advertisers and shows that advertisers can actually bid above their value-per-click in a variety of situations. By contrast, our research focuses on how advertisers' budget constraints affect their profits and the publisher's revenue. Therefore, we study a model with two strategic advertisers who are budgetconstrained, and characterize the equilibrium across a full range of budgets. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The auction theory literature in economics has considered the strategic implications of budget constraints for classic single-unit auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Che and Gale 1998)</ref> and sequential, multi-unit auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benoît and Krishna 2001</ref>). An important difference from these two articles is that our work focuses on the position auction, which has been shown to have distinctive strategic properties relative to these traditional auction settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Varian 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The mechanism design literature has assessed the efficiency of various auction mechanisms used for online advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borgs et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Chen et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Fiat et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, Dobzinski et al. 2012</ref>). Our research differs from this literature by taking the allocation mechanism as fixed and studying the position auctions as currently practiced. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Model</head><p>Our model is a simultaneous-move static game of complete information played by two budget-constrained bidders in a position auction. We model two focal advertisers competing for two ad positions (i.e., "slots") sold by a publisher. We allow advertisers to be different in two dimensions: k , B k , where k is the valueper-click and B k is the daily budget constraint defined as the daily spending limit in the position auction for advertiser k = i j. Budgets and values-per-click are exogenous and common knowledge to reflect the high level of competitive information available to advertisers. In §3.4 we relax the exogenous budget assumption by discussing a case wherein advertisers choose budgets before bidding in the auction.</p><p>The flow rate of clicks from consumers is assumed to be constant. Without loss of generality, we normalize the total daily click volume for the second position to be one and denote the click ratio between the first and second position as . We assume &gt; 1 to reflect the positive effect of a higher rank on CTR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ghose and</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang 2009, Agarwal et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Each advertiser chooses her bid b k ∈ 0 + , k = i j. Henceforth, we assume that i &gt; j to reflect potential differences in the advertisers' values-perclick. The advertiser with the highest bid initially wins the first position and pays the second-highest bid, whereas the second advertiser pays a reservation value r per-click. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The reservation value can be interpreted as the highest bid among a set of nonstrategic, lower-ranked advertisers. In this way, the level of r captures the intensity of external competition among other advertisers for this particular advertising space (e.g., a keyword). We assume that both advertisers' values-per-click are sufficiently large that they have incentives to bid in the auction: i &gt; j &gt; r.</p><p>Depending on the size of an advertiser's budget, the volume of clicks can deplete the budget before the end of the day. An advertiser whose budget has been depleted is removed from the listing. If the advertiser who was initially awarded the first position has her budget depleted, the second advertiser moves up to the first position, receives the improved CTR of , and pays her original CPC, which is r. Meanwhile, we suppose there is an unranked advertiser, z, filling the second position and paying the remaining click volume at a CPC of r with ∈ 0 1 . <ref type="bibr">5</ref> For simplicity, we assume this unranked advertiser z is nonstrategic and always bids r. See §3.4 for a discussion of the case with three strategic bidders.</p><p>Define t i , t j ≤ 1 as the portion of the day the budget of advertiser i or j, respectively, remains unexhausted. Whether an advertiser's budget is exhausted (either or both t i , t j &lt; 1 and the order of their departure (i.e., t i ≷ t j are determined by both advertisers' budgets and bids. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> presents the process of ranked listing when advertiser i wins the first position under two scenarios: (i) Neither i nor j has her budget depleted (t i = t j = 1); and (ii) Only i has her budget depleted (t i = B i / b j &lt; t j = 1 .</p><p>We characterize advertisers' payoffs in this oneshot game as functions of their bids b i b j given the exogenous parameters r i B i j B j .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">When b i ≥ b j i b i b j =        i − b j t j + i − r t i − t j if t i ≥ t j i − b j t i if t i &lt; t j (1) When b i &lt; b j i b i b j =        i − r t j + i − r t i − t j if t i ≥ t j i − r t i if t i &lt; t j<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where i stands for daily advertising return (Table <ref type="table">A2</ref> in the online appendix provides a detailed characterization of each advertiser's profit). Suppose advertiser i is initially awarded the first position (b i &gt; b j .

If the second advertiser's budget is depleted before the first advertiser's (t j &lt; t i ≤ 1 , the first advertiser's CPC reduces to r for the remainder of her time in the first position (t i − t j ). Otherwise, her CPC is b j for the duration, t i . <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The assumption that 0 ≤ r &lt; r captures the fact that another unmodeled advertiser rising to the second position has a CPC less than her bid of r. Because the parameter has no effect on focal advertisers' payoffs, it does not affect the equilibrium bids of advertiser i and j. It also does not affect our results.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i 1 b j i 1 Unranked t i b j j 2 r j 2 1 t i r + 1 − t i r z Unranked 0 z Unranked 2 1 − t i r</formula><p>Alternatively, suppose advertiser i is initially in the second position (b i &lt; b j . For each click she receives i less her CPC, which is r for her entire time in the listing. If the first advertiser's budget is not exhausted before the end of the day (t j = min B j / b i 1 = 1 ≥ t i , advertiser i receives a total of t i clicks. Otherwise, if t j &lt; t i , advertiser i occupies the second position, receives t j clicks, and ascends to the first position at time t j , where she receives t i − t j clicks.</p><p>Like many models of position auctions, our game has multiple Nash equilibria. To select the most intuitive equilibrium, we use the notion of an Undominated Nash Equilibrium (UNE). 6 A pair of bids b i b j is a UNE if it is a Nash equilibrium and neitherb i norb j is a weakly dominated strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Equilibrium Analysis</head><p>We derive our main results by studying the equilibrium outcomes of the game described above. Our derivation relies on an important implication of our equilibrium concept: For each B i B j ∈ ≡ B i B j ∈ 2 B i B j &gt; 0 , there exists a unique UNE outcome defined by (i) the ranking, and (ii) the CPC of both advertisers throughout the duration of the listing. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Sketch of the equilibrium derivation We use a series of indifference conditions that define advertisers' preferences over the two positions to solve for the UNE. For each B i B j ∈ , the indifference condition is characterized by an advertiser's willingness-to-pay (per click), which is defined as a CPC such that the advertiser is indifferent between initially staying at the first and second positions. We then partition the whole budget space into smaller regions based on the corresponding budget thresholds, defined as the smallest budget that is inexhaustible when paying the willingness-topay (per click) at the first position. Under such a partition, an advertiser's profit takes the same functional form in each region. This allows us to characterize the UNE in three steps: (1) Characterize the best-response correspondences of advertisers; (2) Eliminate weakly dominated bids; (3) Find the UNE as the intersection of the best-response correspondences. Because the detailed derivation of the UNE in the whole is quite involved, it is provided in the online appendix. Nevertheless, as Lemmas 1 and 2 will show, the set of all equilibrium outcomes can be categorized into four types. This allows us to partition into four regions, each of which has the same type of equilibrium outcome.</p><p>The first equilibrium outcome is the budget-independent equilibrium (BI). The set of budget-pairs B i B j leading to the BI equilibrium is defined as BI = L BI ∪ S BI ⊂ . Budgets in BI are either sufficiently large ( L BI or at least one advertiser's budget is so small ( S BI that budgets play no strategic role in advertisers' bidding decisions. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Henceforth, we ignore discussion of this region due to the lack of interesting interactions among advertisers. Please refer to the proof of Lemmas 1 and 2 in Section A of the online appendix for a formal definition of BI and all other regions.</p><p>In regions \ BI , there are three other types of equilibrium outcomes, which we call Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III. We superscript \ BI by the advertiser who is initially assigned the first position. We define and characterize these equilibrium outcomes in § §3.1 and 3.2. These outcomes depend on the level of the reservation value r. The full characterization of the UNE in is reported in Table <ref type="table">A4</ref> of the online appendix. In §3.3, we present the main results implied by the equilibrium analysis. Finally, we discuss the generality of our main results in §3.4 by considering two model extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Bidding Equilibrium with a Low</head><p>Reservation Value When the reservation value is relatively small, r &lt; min B i / B j / , advertisers initially in the second position can afford the highest possible daily expenses r. This implies that only the first advertiser may have her budget depleted before the end of the day. In this case, the second advertiser may bid one penny below the first advertiser's bid to accelerate the budget exhaustion. When this occurs, we call it a Type-I equilibrium. It is also possible that the first advertiser's budget is not depleted in equilibrium yet both advertisers' bids are a function of budgets. We call this a Type-II equilibrium. Lemma 1 provides a characterization of these two equilibrium outcomes.</p><p>Lemma 1. If r &lt; min B i / B j / , there are two classes of equilibrium outcomes in addition to the budgetindependent equilibrium. Let index k denote the advertiser initially in the first position, and &gt; 0 be a "penny", i.e., the smallest unit of payment.</p><p>(i) Type-I: Let I = i I ∪ j I be the set of budget pairs B i B j leading to a Type-I equilibrium.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">If B i B j ∈ k I , thenb I k &gt;b I −k =b I k − . Advertiser k's budget is depleted. (ii) Type-II: Let II = i II ∪ j II be the set of budget pairs B i B j leading to a Type-II equilibrium. If B i B j ∈ k II , thenb II k &gt;b II −k andb II −k = −k B −k / −k + B −k − r &lt; w * −k ,</formula><p>where w * −k is the equilibrium bid without budget constraints. 9 Advertiser k's budget is not depleted.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a) graphically depicts the equilibrium regions of Lemma 1. In region I , the high-value or low-value advertiser might take the second position and bid one penny less than the first advertiser, depending on their relative budget sizes. The Type-I equilibrium occurs under one of the following two conditions: (i) The discrepancy in budgets is small so that the competition for the first position is intense (the lower portion of i I and all of j I ; (ii) The lowvalue advertiser j has a larger budget and the highvalue advertiser i's budget is moderate (the upper portion of i I . In the latter case, advertiser i has a higher willingness-to-pay (per click) than advertiser j. This causes advertiser i to outbid j and initially stay at the first position. Furthermore, because i's budget is not too large, advertiser j can bid one penny less than i to quickly deplete i's budget and then ascend to the first position.</p><p>The Type-II equilibrium occurs for B i B j ∈ II . As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a), one advertiser's budget is sufficiently larger than the other's in this region. Consequently, the first-ranked advertiser's budget is inexhaustible in equilibrium because of her significant budget advantage. On the other hand, because of the second advertiser's relatively small budget, she shades her bid below w * , i.e., her willingness-to-pay (per click) without a budget constraint. Specifically, if B i B j ∈ i II , then advertiser j takes the second position with the bidb j = j B j / j + B j − r &lt;b i − 9 When both advertisers have unlimited budgets, our model reduces to a standard second-price auction with each advertiser k bidding her willingness-to-pay (per click), which equals w * k = 1 − 1/ k + r/ . In Claim 1 in the online appendix, we prove that w * k is the unique equilibrium bid.</p><p>to eliminate the incentive of advertiser i to bid one penny less thanb j and deplete j's budget. Therefore, in equilibrium, advertiser j's bid must equate her profit at the second position, j − r, with that of initially obtaining the first position and having her budget depleted at time t j j t j − B j , where t j = B j / b j . Note that the second advertiser's bid is always below w * in II because the potential threat of budget exhaustion drives her to bid cautiously. By bidding conservatively, the second advertiser provides the incentive for the large-budget advertiser to stay at the first position due to the lower CPC. In other words, the large-budget advertiser's willingness-to-pay (per click) is greater than that of the other advertiser; she therefore outbids the small-budget advertiser. This can happen even if the large-budget advertiser has a lower value-per-click. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jerath et al. (2011)</ref> call this a "position paradox."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Bidding Equilibrium with a High</head><p>Reservation Value We now investigate the instance wherein the reservation value is large, r ≥ min B i / B j / . In this case, the external competition in the position auction is so intense that at least one advertiser will drop from the listing before the end of the day. Furthermore, due to the larger reservation value, or equivalently, the higher CPC paid by the second advertiser, the second advertiser might not have enough remaining budget to digest the additional click volume should she ascend to the first position.</p><p>The potential budget exhaustion by the reservation value gives rise to a new Type-III equilibrium. Under this new equilibrium the initially secondranked advertiser bids proportionally to the firstranked advertiser's budget to deplete it at a slower rate than in the Type-I equilibrium.

By contrast to the Type-I equilibrium, the second advertiser in a Type-III equilibrium does not quickly drive out the first advertiser by bidding higher. This is because doing so brings no extra benefit to the second advertiser and provides the rival with the incentive to undercut her bid by one penny and deplete her budget. To reduce such an incentive, the second advertiser will choose the lowest bid among a set of bids that can achieve maximum profit. This suggests that the second advertiser bids proportionally to the first-ranked advertiser's budget so that the second advertiser's budget is depleted exactly at the end of the period (see a more detailed explanation along with a numerical example in Section A in the online appendix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Impact of Budgets on Advertiser Profits and</head><p>Publisher Revenue Based on the results from Lemmas 1 and 2, we now examine the impact of budgets on advertisers' profits and publisher's revenue. Formal expressions of each party's payoff are provided in Table <ref type="table">A5</ref> in the online appendix.</p><p>Proposition 1. If r ≥ min B i / B j / and B i B j ∈ III , the first advertiser's profit strictly decreases with her budget. Otherwise, each advertiser's profit weakly increases with her budget.</p><p>We find that an advertiser's profit always weakly increases with her budget except in III , where the external competition is intense (i.e., r ≥ min B i / B j / . To illustrate this intuition, suppose B i B j ∈ i III . According to Lemma 2, advertiser j bids proportionally to advertiser i's budget and initially occupies the second position. By bidding proportionally to B i , advertiser j depletes advertiser i's budget at a specific time point so that her remaining budget can afford the increased CTR from the time of ascension to the end of the day. This equilibrium bid choice of advertiser j links advertiser i's budget directly to advertiser i's CPC in equilibrium. In other words, advertiser i's CPC increases with her own budget, but her total click volume, B i /b III j = r − B j / − 1 r, does not. In this scenario, what we call a budget trap, an increase in the first advertiser's budget results only in a higher CPC and, therefore, a lower profit.</p><p>Outside of III , a larger daily budget brings an advertiser advantages in the position auction in two situations. First, for the second-ranked advertiser, a larger budget affords her the ability to bid more aggressively to exhaust the above-ranked competitor's budget and ascend in position sooner. Second, when the first-ranked advertiser's budget exceeds a threshold, the below-ranked competitor will shade her bid, and consequently reduce the first advertiser's CPC.</p><p>Next we summarize our finding of the impact of budgets on the publisher's revenue.</p><p>Proposition 2. The publisher's revenue weakly increases with an advertiser's budget except in the following two scenarios:</p><p>(i) Change in equilibrium type: An increase in the firstranked advertiser's budget causes the equilibrium to change from Type-I equilibrium to Type-II or BI equilibrium.</p><p>(ii) Change in ad position: An increase in the high-value advertiser's budget, B i , causes her initial equilibrium position to change from the second to the first.</p><p>Intuitively, an increase in an advertiser's budget should always benefit the publisher: For a fixed CPC, a larger budget means a larger amount of clicks an advertiser may receive, thereby transferring more surplus from the advertiser to the publisher. However, after accounting for the strategic impact of budgets on advertisers' bid choices, a counterintuitive result arises: The publisher's revenue can strictly decrease with an advertiser's budget. As indicated in Proposition 2, this can happen in two scenarios. The first is when the first advertiser has a more-than-necessary daily budget. In this case, the first advertiser's budget is no longer exhaustible even if the second advertiser bids one penny less than her bid. As a response, the second advertiser shades her bid in equilibrium. This reduces the first advertiser's payment and therefore hurts the publisher's revenue. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates this situation in which an increase in either advertiser's budget causes a switch from I into II or L BI . The second scenario is when an increase in the high-value advertiser's budget induces her to bid for the first position despite a disadvantaged budget. This corresponds to the case wherein an increase in B i causes a switch from j I to i I (for any r), from j II to i I (only for r &lt; min B i / B j / or from j III to i III (only for r ≥ min B i / B j / . In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, these are represented by an increase in B i , which crosses the boundary indicated by the dotted line or the vertical line that separates j II and i I . In all of these situations, the publisher benefits from the larger-budget advertiser staying in the first position because of the greater surplus transferred from advertisers' budgets to the publisher. Hence, when the high-value advertiser's budget increases to the level that forces the low-value, but larger-budget, competitor to step down from the top, the publisher suffers revenue losses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Extensions to the Basic Model</head><p>In our main model, we limited ourselves to only two strategic advertisers for simplicity. To determine whether our main results still hold when the number of bidders increases, we consider a model extension with three strategic bidders competing for two ad slots. This extension is analytically intractable and we resort to a numerical analysis in Section C in the online appendix. Consistent with our main findings, our simulation shows that there can be a negative impact of budgets on advertisers' profits and on the publisher's revenue.</p><p>Our main analysis focuses on advertisers with exogenous budgets to capture firms' liquidity constraints. Yet advertisers may have the flexibility to soften their budget constraints through the financial services, which are sometimes directly offered by the publisher (e.g., Google's credit card). To provide a deeper understanding of the strategic impact of budgets, we examine a model extension in Section D in the online appendix in which advertisers endogenously set budgets before bidding. Our finding from this extension echoes the result from Proposition 2: The publisher can be worse off by incentivizing advertisers to expand their budgets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Implications</head><p>This paper studies the impact of liquidity constraints on advertisers' bidding behaviors in position auctions. We conduct a comprehensive equilibrium analysis and our results provide several managerial insights for advertisers and publishers in the online advertising industry.</p><p>Our analysis suggests that advertisers in position auctions with budget constraints face complex considerations when determining their bids. For instance, an advertiser with a sufficient budget may consider bidding aggressively to deplete the budget of a higherranked advertiser. Indeed, as reported in §1, there is evidence of advertisers bidding one penny below the bid of the above-ranked advertiser, just as the bidder initially staying at the second position in a Type-I equilibrium (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ganchev et al. 2007)</ref>. Alternatively, an advertiser may play conservatively to avoid being aggressively driven out of the listing. Google's own AdWords advises budget-constrained advertisers to consider reducing bids, 10 which is in line with the smaller-budget advertiser's bid strategy in a Type-II equilibrium. To address such a complexity, advertisers should actively collect budget-related information and adjust their bids accordingly.</p><p>Advertisers should also be aware of a peculiar budget trap situation, in which an advertiser's CPC increases proportionally (and profit decreases) in her own budget. Our analysis indicates that a budget trap will arise when both advertisers' budgets are relatively small and the external competition is fierce. Recently some advertisers have stated that their CPC actually increases with their own budgets in a linear rate. This pattern is consistent with our prediction in a Type-III equilibrium. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> One major finding in this paper is that the publisher's revenue can be negatively affected by advertisers' budgets in position auctions. Thus, publishers should be careful when encouraging advertisers to expand their budgets by offering financial services. For example, Google recently offered small-sized advertisers a new credit card with a competitive interest rate and an ample credit line to promote larger budgets in position auctions. This credit card can only be used to pay for online advertising expenses and is exclusively offered to small advertisers selected by Google. This practice can be regarded as an effort to encourage advertisers to allocate more money to online advertising. However, as indicated in Proposition 2, a firm with a high value-per-click but a small budget may induce a higher bid from the lower-ranked advertiser. Easing the budget of the higher-ranked advertiser may provoke conservative Marketing Science 34(6), pp. 897-905, © 2015 INFORMS bidding by the lower-ranked advertiser and correspondingly decrease publisher revenue. Therefore, publishers may want to refrain from providing budget assistance if such a practice induces advertisers to bid less aggressively.</p><p>In this paper, we made several simplifying assumptions, which open directions for future research. First, we assumed that the advertisers' submitted budgets are real financial constraints. This simplification allows us to abstract away any strategic gaming by budget misreporting to focus on advertisers' interactions at the bidding stage. Future research can extend our study by considering whether/how this strategic decision may affect advertisers' incentive to bid. Second, we focused on understanding the role of budget constraints in advertisers' bidding strategies in a stylized setting. We did not consider the strategic role of a publisher in the model. A full analysis of the publisher's incentive in a position auction is beyond the objective of this paper, but it may point to a fruitful direction for future research. Finally, by relaxing our complete information assumption on values-per-click and budgets, an extension with a two-dimensional, incomplete information game for position auctions could be an interesting but challenging opportunity for future work.</p></div>
