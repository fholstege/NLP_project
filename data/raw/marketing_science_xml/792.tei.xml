<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper demonstrates that under relatively unrestrictive assumptions, tacit collusion becomes more difficult to sustain as the level of product differentiation increases when there are high enough costs associated with collusion. This lack of ambiguity contrasts with the previous theoretical literature on tacit collusion and product differentiation, which finds that the direction of the relationship between product differentiation and collusive stability depends on the particular model of product differentiation that is used.</p><p>At the heart of this issue is a simple trade-off: While firms selling homogeneous products have the most to gain from tacit collusion, they also have the most to gain from cheating on the collusive agreement. The result is that the exact demand specification determines which effect dominates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tyagi 1999</ref>). In contrast with the mixed results in the theoretical literature, 1 empirical studies consistently find that collusion occurs more frequently among firms selling homogeneous products. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Levenstein and Suslow (2006)</ref> examine the cartel literature and conclude that price fixing occurs more frequently in homogeneous product markets. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> These observations match the general findings among empirical papers testing for collusion: Those looking at homogeneous firms generally find tacit collusion, while those examining heterogeneous firms generally cannot reject that firms are competing using static Nash outcomes. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This paper proposes a general reason why it might be easiest to support tacit collusion among homogeneous firms-that there is a cost to maintaining or coordinating collusion. Costs of maintaining collusion could include monitoring costs, communication costs, or the continual potential of being caught and punished for illegally colluding. Costs of coordinating collusion could include costs of building collusionspecific infrastructure or the cost of negotiating the collusive outcome. We show that the presence of these costs increases the difficulty of sustaining collusion more for firms that are more differentiated.</p><p>To see the intuition behind this result, note that the ease of collusion is based upon the patience required to balance short-term gains from cheating with longterm benefits from colluding. Introducing costs of maintaining collusion increases the short-run gains from cheating (because the firm no longer has to incur the costs of colluding) and reduces the long-run benefits from colluding (by the amount of the costs of collusion), making collusion more difficult to support.</p><p>The degree to which collusion becomes more difficult is higher when the products are more differentiated because the sizes of both the short-run gain from cheating and the long-run benefit from collusion are smaller, so the percentage change of each effect from costs of collusion are larger. The effect of these costs is strong enough that collusion becomes monotonically harder to sustain as products grow more heterogeneous when these costs are large enough.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Costs of Collusion</head><p>The premise of this paper is that there are costs to coordinating and maintaining collusion. In this section, we discuss the sources of these costs along with empirical evidence of their existence. The costs that we focus on are costs of negotiating collusive outcomes, costs of building social and institutional structures needed to sustain collusion, costs of monitoring the other firms' actions, and costs from the risk of prosecution.</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that the costs of negotiating a collusive outcome are generally large. One reason is that there is often no focal point for the firms to select as the equilibrium when the firms are asymmetric. This lack of a focal point is reflected in the different choices academic researchers have made in selecting which collusive outcome they believe is most reasonable: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Donsimoni (1985)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Athey and Bagwell (2001)</ref> use joint profit maximization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jehiel (1992)</ref> uses the Nash bargaining solution, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Friedman and Thisse (1993)</ref> assume that collusive profits will be proportional to the ratio of the profits without collusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Knittel and Stango (2003)</ref> show that the lack of focal collusive outcomes can inhibit tacit collusion. They find that collusion is more prevalent in credit card markets where price ceilings have been enacted than in markets without such regulations because the price ceilings act as focal points for what the collusive outcome should be. Other studies of collusion have found that coordinating collusion requires face-toface meetings, which cost money, time, effort, andbecause these meetings are illegal-a probability of prosecution. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Connor (2001)</ref> discusses the difficulties in setting up overt collusion in the lysine and citric acid markets. Even once a collusive outcome is determined, many authors have shown that collusion can be maintained only with constant communication and frequent meetings to coordinate each period's actions. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> It has also been shown that collusion flourishes best when the interactions between firms have a social context, which requires an investment on the part of the firms. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In addition to building social infrastructure, firms often need to make institutional investments to support collusion. For example, firms participating in the lysine cartel had to figure out how to adhere to their quota without alerting either the middle managers or their salesforce that such restrictions existed. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Externally, collusion has often involved creating trade associations that coordinate the collusive schemes, and publish and verify the output of cartel members to facilitate punishing firms that violate the agreements. These trade associations also provide a forum for discussion and renegotiation.</p><p>Monitoring can be a significant cost of collusion. In cases of tacit collusion, monitoring can involve directly examining competitors' actions. For example, store managers might visit nearby stores to see their prices, or airlines might watch competitor's prices on a large search engine like Orbitz. <ref type="bibr">7</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Connor (2001)</ref> notes that monitoring for some formal cartels has involved opening up facilities and inventories to on-site inspections by competitors. Other common forms of monitoring involve using a trade association or third-party auditor to collect and verify prices or output, or, for some formal cartels, using a joint sales agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Levenstein and Suslow 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Finally, because collusion is generally illegal, setting up collusion involves indirect costs from the risk of prosecution. This risk increases as the collusion lasts longer, and as it involves more phone calls, communication, and documentation. This is both because of the increased risk of a mole or a leak of documentation and because the government is more likely to notice the collusion the longer it continues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Costly Collusion and Product Differentiation</head><p>In this section we demonstrate that it is more difficult to support tacit collusion as product differentiation increases when the costs of collusion are high enough. We limit our analysis by considering only the difficulty of sustaining full collusion between firms. 9 Also, we focus on punishments using Nash reversion grim trigger strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Friedman 1971</ref>). 10 Under this scheme, firms collude as long as no firm has deviated in the past. However, if a deviation ever occurs, then firms forever revert to playing the Nash equilibrium of the stage game. This punishment structure is commonly used, and there are reasons to believe it is reasonable in our context. First, implementing other punishments could require many of the same costs as collusion, while Nash reversion punishments are self-enforcing. Also, a firm could have the unilateral ability to get out of punishments that are more severe by notifying the government about the price-fixing scheme and demanding that the government investigate whether the actions of the other firm are consistent with competitive behavior. This is made credible by laws in many countries that grant amnesty to the first firm that confesses to a price-fixing scheme. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The model we use is very basic. For notational simplicity, we assume that firms are symmetric, although the model can easily be modified to handle asymmetric firms. Let d be an index that captures the level of differentiation. Denote the (assumed stationary expected value of) collusive profits of each firm as C d , the static Nash equilibrium profits as N d , and the profit that a firm derives from unilaterally deviating from a collusive agreement as D d . Let be the discount factor, which we, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lal (1990)</ref>, define as "the net present value of $1 received at the end of each period." We assume that C d , D d , and N d are continuous and once differentiable at all but a finite number of levels of differentiation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Note that D d ≥ C d ≥ N d .</formula><p>Given this, collusion can then be sustained under Nash reversion if 1/ 1−</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C d ≥ D d + / 1− • N d , or equivalently, if ≥ˆ d ≡ D d − C d D d − N d (1)</formula><p>Note thatˆ d will be continuous and differentiable at all but a finite number of levels of differentiation, given the assumptions on D d , C d , and N d . We say that collusion is easier to support as the discount factor required to sustain it becomes smaller. We make two assumptions: 12</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C − N d &lt; 0 (A1) D − C d &lt; 0 (A2)</formula><p>Assumption (A1) states that the gain from colluding is highest among homogeneous products and decreases with the level of product differentiation. Using collusion over price as an example, this is reasonable on an intuitive level because competition tempers prices less when products are more differentiated. Assumption (A2) states that the gain from deviating from a collusive agreement is also greatest among homogeneous products. Returning to the example with price, the intuition here is that a firm will gain fewer consumers from undercutting a competitor's price under greater levels of differentiation, so the one-time gain from cheating is smaller. These assumptions hold for the most common models of product differentiation-including all those cited in this article-and do not imply that collusion will be either easier or harder to sustain with increased product differentiation. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Now suppose that there is a recurring cost, C, of maintaining collusion. The profit accrued in each period under collusion becomes C * = C − C. Collusion is then more difficult to sustain as the level of product differentiation increases whenever the costs of maintaining collusion are high enough. To see this, note that the critical discount factor becomeŝ</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">* = D − C D − N + C D − N</formula><p>with these costs. The first term tends to determine the effect of differentiation on collusion when these costs are small; the direction of the effect is then ambiguous and dependent on the functional form of the model. However, when C is sufficiently large, the effect of the second term dominates, and the fact that the denominator shrinks with product differentiation causes the critical discount factor to increase. When the costs of collusion are large enough, collusion is monotonically more difficult to sustain as the level of differentiation increases.</p><p>Proposition 1. Assume that (A1) and (A2) hold.</p><p>Then there exists a level of costs for sustaining collusion, C, such that collusion is (weakly) monotonically more difficult to sustain under Nash reversion as the level of differentiation increases for any C &gt; C. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Proof. Collusion is monotonically more difficult to sustain if ˆ * / d &gt; 0, which holds if and only if lnˆ</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">* / d &gt; 0. Note that ln ˆ * d = ln D − C + C d − ln D − N d = D − C / d D − C + C − D − N / d D − N (2)</formula><p>where the second equality holds because of the chain rule. Assumptions (A1) and (A2) jointly imply that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D − N d = D − C d + C − N d &lt; D − C d &lt; 0 (3)</formula><p>Thus, Equation (2) is positive whenever C is large enough. A sufficient condition for this is that D − C + C ≥ D − N . This implies that C &lt; C 0 − N 0 , where o denotes the profit levels that arise when  <ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we see that the relationship between the level of product differentiation and the ease of tacit collusion is nonmonotonic. However, once a cost of collusion is introduced, it is apparent that the difficulty of colluding increases dramatically when products are differentiated, but that this difficulty changes only a little bit when the products are homogeneous. If costs are high enough, then a monotonic relationship between the level of product differentiation and the critical discount factor emerges. Figures <ref type="figure">2 and 3</ref> show similar effects for the other models. In these models, the ease of collusion increases with product differentiation in the absence of costs of maintaining collusion, but once the costs of collusion are large enough, the result of Proposition 1 is restored, and collusion becomes more difficult among firms selling products that are more heterogeneous. It is evident in these figures that the results for Proposition 1 generally hold for a wide range of costs and product differentiation, as noted in Footnote 15.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d = 0, because D − C + C 0 − N 0 ≥ D − N for</formula><p>Proposition 1 demonstrates that collusion is most easily supported among firms selling homogeneous products when maintaining tacit collusion involves recurring costs. It turns out that onetime setup costs of collusion have the same effect, although the mechanism is different. If it is sufficiently expensive to coordinate collusion, then firms will choose to compete through Nash competition and avoid this cost. Because the gains from collusion will decrease with greater product differentiation, this will affect firms selling heterogeneous products more than those selling homogeneous products. 18</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>Despite the result in the theoretical literature that the functional form of demand dictates whether tacit collusion is easiest to sustain for homogeneous or heterogeneous products, empirical studies have shown that collusion generally occurs among firms selling homogeneous goods. This paper bridges these results by noting that theory predicts that collusion will be easiest to support among homogeneous firms, regardless of the shape of demand, when there are large enough costs associated with collusion. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> In this paper, we assume that the costs of collusion are constant across levels of differentiation. However, this might not always be true. For example, monitoring costs could increase with the level of differentiation because it might be more difficult to observe prices or detect secret defections at outlets that are far away. Similarly, costs of setting up collusion may increase with the level of product differentiation because greater asymmetry between firms might increase the cost of negotiations. For example, when products are homogeneous, firms can agree on a single price or output level for the product; but when products are more heterogeneous it is possible that the firms would have to set a schedule of prices and output levels. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> While endogenizing these costs is beyond the scope of this paper, we note that the monotonicity of Proposition 1 is reinforced when these costs increase in the level of differentiation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Deneckere's Model with Bertrand Competition</figDesc></figure>

However, the events of September 11, 2001 three months after Orbitz's launch made a comparison of pre-and post-Orbitz pricing more difficult. See the U.S. Department of Justice press release at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/ 2003/201208.htm (accurate as of May 20, 2006).8 Some readers might be concerned about whether costly monitoring can be a credible equilibrium outcome. However, it is possible to work out a game-theoretic model where both players always abide by the agreement and yet pay to monitor on the equilibrium path. The essential kernel of the model is that a firm choosing not to monitor is effectively a signal to end collusion. We present the model in Technical Appendix 1 at http://mksci.pubs.informs.org.</note>

Thus, if the sufficient condition is binding, the only cost where collusion could be supported and where the monotonic relationship would hold would be C 0 − N 0 , and the region where collusion could be supported at this cost would collapse to d = 0 (no differentiation). However, in practice, this sufficient condition is far from binding for commonly used models of product differentiation, as illustrated in the next paragraph. Thus, the result usually holds for a wide range of costs, and the monotonicity applies over a wide range of product differentiation.</note>
