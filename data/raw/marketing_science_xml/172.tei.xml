<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We investigate the increasingly common business setting in which companies face the possibility of both observed and unobserved customer attrition (i.e., "overt" and "silent" churn) in the same pool of customers. This is the case for many online-based services where customers have the choice to stop interacting with the firm either by formally terminating the relationship (e.g., canceling their account) or by simply ignoring all communications coming from the firm. The standard contractual versus noncontractual categorization of customer-firm relationships does not apply in such hybrid settings, which means the standard models for analyzing customer attrition do not apply. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to capture silent and overt churn. We apply our modeling framework to two different contexts-a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. In contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two types of churn, we find that overt churners in these hybrid settings tend to interact more, rather than less, with the firm prior to churning; that is, in settings where both types of churn are present, a high level of activity-such as customers actively opening emails received from the firm-is not necessarily a good indicator of future engagement; rather it is associated with higher risk of overt churn. We also identify a large number of "silent churners" in both empirical applications-customers who disengage with the company very early on, rarely exhibit any type of activity, and almost never churn overtly. Furthermore, we show how the two types of churners respond very differently to the firm's communications, implying that a common retention strategy for proactive churn management is not appropriate in these hybrid settings.</p><p>History: K.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Understanding and managing customer retention is one of the most important aspects of customer relationship management <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blattberg et al. 2008)</ref>. As companies become more proactive in their management of customer retention, managers are increasingly interested in identifying those customers at risk of leaving the firm (i.e., churning) and in finding ways to reduce such churn. It is common to make the distinction between identifying and predicting churn in contractual versus noncontractual settings. In contractual settings, the existence of a contract between the customer and the firm means the firm will know when the customer has ended her relationship with the firm. By contrast, customers in noncontractual settings do not explicitly signal to the firm that they wish to terminate their relationship. As a result, the firm does not observe churn, only an absence of behavior.</p><p>In the digital era, with the proliferation of free and freemium-type pricing schemes, customers often have a formal relationship with the firm (e.g., an account or subscription) but do not need to continue paying the firm to keep the relationship alive. Examples include services such as daily deal sites (e.g., Groupon), social networks (e.g., LinkedIn), online games (e.g., Candy Crush), and web-based email services (e.g., Gmail). In such settings, customers can choose whether to churn overtly by informing the company that they wish to terminate their relationship with the firm (e.g., closing the account) or just silently disappear without saying goodbye (e.g., never interacting with the firm again). These settings constitute a hybrid of the standard contractual and noncontractual categorizations of customer-firm relationships. Treating such hybrid settings as noncontractual, thus ignoring overt churn (e.g., account closure), misses the opportunity to identify, predict, and manage overt churners. On the other hand, treating such a hybrid setting as contractual, thus ignoring latent attrition, erroneously assumes that all customers who did not inform the firm about Ascarza, Netzer, and Hardie: Customers Would Rather Leave Without Saying Goodbye <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> 55 their silent termination of the relationship were indeed active customers.</p><p>In this paper we explore such hybrid settings by analyzing customer behavior in two different contexts: a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. By separating silent churners from overt churners we are able to not only understand and predict both types of churn but also explore possible levers to better manage the customer base. In contrast to previous studies, which have not separated the two types of churn, we consistently find that overt churners tend to interact more, rather than less, with the firm. In other words, in hybrid settings, a high level of activity (represented in our empirical applications by frequently opening the emails received from the firm) may not necessarily imply high levels of engagement in the future. Rather, it might be associated with a higher risk of overtly churning. Despite the differences across the two contexts investigated in this research, we consistently find that while overt churners tend to frequently consider the firm's communications (i.e., open emails received from the firm), they rarely engage with the content (e.g., they do not click on links in the emails). This suggests that such customers are not finding the right offering(s) and therefore, after repeated disappointments, terminate their relationship with the firm. We also find a large number of silent churners in both empirical applications. These are customers who disengage from the company very early on, rarely open emails, and almost never explicitly unsubscribe from the service. In other words, many customers are leaving without saying goodbye.</p><p>To accommodate and separate both types of churn, we develop a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework that allows us to capture different latent states of customer behavior: those customers who are at risk of overtly churning (captured by an "at risk" state), those who have silently churned (captured by a "silently gone" state), and those who plan to continue interacting with the firm (captured by an "engaged" state). The model allows customers to transition among these states, thereby capturing dynamics in their relationship with the firm. Furthermore, we allow factors such as the content and quality of the firm's communications to differentially affect customers' transitions among (latent) states, as well as impact their behavior (given state membership).</p><p>Using our model, we demonstrate that different firm actions are needed to mitigate the risks of overt and silent churn. Specifically, we find that sending communications with "better" content to customers in the "at risk" (of overtly churning) state can encourage them to move to a state of engagement where they are more likely to click on the email and less likely to overtly churn. Moreover, sending the "better" content (e.g., content customized to better match customers' preferences) reduces the probability that engaged customers will silently leave. Managing those who have already left silently is more challenging. We find that once a customer transitions to the "silently gone" state, the firm is highly unlikely to reengage the customer using previously used communication methods. These findings have important implications for marketers. Firms should either find creative ways to reengage these customers or simply let them go (i.e., stop sending them communications).</p><p>We continue by discussing the relevant literature on overt and silent churn (Section 2). In Section 3, we develop a model that accommodates both types of churn in hybrid settings. In Sections 4 and 5 we apply our model to two different contexts, a daily deal website and a performing arts organization, and show how the model clearly separates the two types of churn. Using counterfactual analyses, we also demonstrate how the firm could differentially mitigate the two types of churn by changing the quality of its offerings and the type of communication with its customers. We conclude (Section 6) with a discussion of the theoretical and practical contributions of this paper and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overt vs. Silent Churn</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schmittlein et al. (1987)</ref>, it is common to characterize the nature of a firm's relationship with its customer base in terms of whether or not the loss of a customer is observed by the firm. The term contractual is used for those settings in which the loss of the customer is observed by the firm. These include both settings where the "default" is that the provision of the service will stop at a specific point in time (known in advance to the firm and the customer) unless the customer takes a specific action (e.g., renews a subscription or membership) and those settings where the "default" is that the firm continues to provide the service until the customer contacts the firm to cancel her contract. The term noncontractual is used for those settings where the loss of the customer is not observed by the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Reinartz 1999)</ref>. There is no explicit signal from the customer to the firm that she has stopped being a customer; instead, she silently attrites <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mason 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The rich literature on customer attrition has modeled churn according to this dichotomized categorization. In contractual settings, (observed) attrition is often modeled in terms of whether or not the customer churns at the end of each period using logistic regression or more general data-mining techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ascarza 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Coussement and Van den Poel 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Lemmens and Croux 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Neslin et al. 2006</ref> or in terms of how long she remains a customer using a duration-time model (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hardie 2007, Schweidel et al. 2008)</ref>. The majority of this literature has focused on identifying predictors of churn, <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> which typically consist of customer characteristics (e.g., demographics), past interactions with the firm (e.g., complaints, product returns, calls to customer service), and measures of past usage, generally summarized in terms of the recency and frequency of past activity. While the exact operationalization of the activity variables and their effect sizes vary among industries and across studies, a consistent finding in contractual settings is that a lack of (or decline in) customer activity is a strong predictor of customer loss (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ascarza and Hardie 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Borle et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Buckinx et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Chen et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Coussement and De Bock 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Lemmens and Croux 2006</ref>.</p><p>In noncontractual settings, attrition is by definition unobserved. As such, it is not modeled directly but must be inferred from a lack of observed transaction activity. Models such as the Pareto/NBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schmittlein et al. 1987)</ref>, the BG/NBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fader et al. 2005</ref>) and the BG/BB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fader et al. 2010</ref>) assume customers behave as if they transact randomly around their mean propensity until they "die" at some time that is unobserved by the firm. The resulting model can then be used to infer the probability that a customer with a given transaction history is still "alive." Because identifying churn is already a challenge (as it is unobserved), the literature on noncontractual settings has mostly focused on identifying which customers are most likely to have "died" (i.e., silently churned), rather than identifying which factors precede such latent attrition. Notable exceptions are <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Braun et al. (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knox and Van Oest (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Knox (2013), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schweidel et al. (2014)</ref>, which build on the aforementioned latent attrition models and allow for covariates such as direct marketing activity and characteristics of customer transactions to impact the probability of (silently) churning.</p><p>While many businesses fit a binary contractual/noncontractual categorization of customer-firm relationships, there are many hybrid settings where the loss of some customers is observed by the firm while the loss of others is unobserved. As such, it is the customer who decides whether to churn latently or overtly. While such phenomena are not entirely new, 1 the coexistence of observed and unobserved attrition has not been explored. Developments in information technology and the proliferation of digital services imply that the number of such hybrid settings is rapidly growing. For example, in the days of traditional catalog retailing, the cost to customers of telling the retailer that they were no longer interested in receiving the catalogs was sufficiently high that they "silently attrited." Nowadays, customers can simply click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email communication received from the retailer to "formally" churn. Many online services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay) as well as most mobile games (e.g., CandyCrush) belong to the category of hybrid settings. For example, a Facebook user who no longer wishes to use the service can either explicitly close her account or simply stop logging on.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of such hybrid settings in today's economy, to our knowledge, the duality between observed and unobserved attrition has not been investigated. 2 Accordingly, the objectives of this research are to highlight the coexistence of both types of churn in many business settings, to investigate the dynamics between customer activity and each of these churn types, and to explore how firms can manage churn (both overt and silent) in such hybrid settings. To do so, we build a model that not only accommodates but also separates both types of churn (based on other behaviors observed by the firm) and allows factors such as marketing actions to affect customer behaviors in the short run as well as the medium to long term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Model</head><p>We generalize the existing methods for modeling customer attrition by proposing a modeling framework that can accommodate both observed and unobserved churn. In particular, we use an HMM as a unifying framework suitable for both types of churn.</p><p>There is a long tradition of using (manifest) Markov models to characterize buyer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fader et al. 2014)</ref>, and to model the behavior of a customer base. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deming and Glasser (1968)</ref> modeled the duration of customer subscriptions in a contractual setting using a Markov chain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dwyer's (1989)</ref> customer migration model of behavior in noncontractual settings can be viewed as a Markov model in which the observed states are characterized by the customer's past activity summarized in terms of recency, frequency, and monetary value <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pfeifer and Carraway 2000)</ref>. More recently, a number of researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ascarza and Hardie 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Netzer et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schweidel et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schweidel et al. , 2014</ref> used hidden/latent Markov models to capture dynamics in the nature of the relationship between customers and the firm in both contractual and noncontractual settings.</p><p>As mentioned above, the standard latent attrition models for noncontractual settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schmittlein et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Fader et al. 2010</ref>) capture dynamics in behavior via a latent absorbing state: customers transact/spend at a constant rate until they become permanently inactive (at which time their transaction/spend rate goes to zero). While they have been extended to capture multiple behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schweidel et al. 2014</ref>), they do not allow for dynamics in behavior while the customer is "alive." So rather than starting with a latent attrition model and adding on churn as a possible behavior while the customer is "alive," we take the more flexible approach of building our model using an HMM. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This allows for a richer set of dynamics in customer behavior. For example, customers can change their propensity to unsubscribe or to engage with the service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Underlying Logic</head><p>We seek to model the multidimensional behavior of customers over time. Each period we observe whether or not the customer has terminated their relationship with the firm (unsubscribing, in the examples used in our empirical applications) as well as their behavior on one or more dimensions of interest (opening emails and clicking on links, in the examples used in our empirical applications). In the case of an app, app deletion would be the signal of relationship termination, and the other behaviors of interest could include time spent using the app and in-app purchases. In a social network context, termination would be captured by account closure, and activities could include connection requests, posts, likes, and so on. Because we observe the same behaviors in both of the empirical applications presented in Sections 4 and 5-open, click, and unsubscribe-we will, for expositional clarity, develop our model in terms of these three behaviors. (The model can easily be modified to accommodate other behaviors.)</p><p>More formally, we have a trivariate binary ran-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dom vector Y it [Y o it , Y c it , Y u it ] with realization y it [y o it , y c it , y u it ]</formula><p>, where y o it 1 if individual i opens the email sent in period t (0 otherwise), y c it 1 if individual i clicks on any link in the email sent in period t (0 otherwise), and y u it 1 if individual i unsubscribes via the email opened in period t (0 otherwise).</p><p>We assume the existence of a set of latent states that reflect the nature of an individual's relationship with the firm and model P(Y it y it ) as a function (in part) of the latent state occupied by individual i in period t. For example, we expect that a customer who is at risk of terminating her relationship with the firm will be captured by a state that exhibits a high probability of unsubscribing. By contrast, a customer who is engaged with the firm and has a low risk of churning will be captured by a state characterized by high levels of activity (opening and clicking) and a low probability of unsubscribing. Finally, we expect that a "silent churner" will be captured by a state characterized by both very low levels of activity (opening and clicking) and a low probability of unsubscribing.</p><p>It is important to note that while we could impose additional structure on the latent states-e.g., latent attrition being captured by an absorbing state that allows no activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schwartz et al. 2014</ref>)-we instead allow the data to inform us about what types of relationship states exist and the nature of customer behavior given the states. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We assume that individuals transition among the latent states following a firstorder Markov process, thus capturing when customers transition from an "active" to an "inactive" state, or to a state with a high risk of termination. Furthermore, to better understand the antecedents and consequences of the two types of churn, we allow managerially relevant covariates such as the quality of the firm's offerings and types of communications with customers to affect customers' transitions among states as well as their behaviors given membership of a particular state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model Specification</head><p>The model comprises two main components, both occurring at the individual level: (i) the "relationship state" evolution and (ii) the customer's state-dependent behaviors (e.g., the probability of opening, clicking, and unsubscribing). To avoid spurious inferences about dynamics in customer behavior, we account for heterogeneity in the parameters of both the state evolution and the customer behavior (given state membership) processes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Application 1: Daily Deal Website</head><p>We first apply our model to data from a daily deal website that promotes discounted goods and services to its customers via email. Customers join the service by visiting the company's website and signing up with an email address. At the moment of activation, the customer decides which types of deals she wants to receive (e.g., travel, food) and states her preferred location (e.g., Chicago, New York City). Each day, the company gathers deals from other websites (e.g., Groupon, Gilt, LivingSocial) and sends an email to each subscriber based on the categories she previously selected and her geographical location. The company does not work directly with the retailers and service providers to offer deals in its emails; it simply aggregates deals from different deal websites. As such, the company has limited control and discretion over which deals it decides to offer. Each email contains up to 10 deals and includes pictures of the deals offered as well as other information, such as the identity of the company offering the deal, the discount level, and how long until the deal expires. Once the customer clicks on a deal, she is taken to a different website from which she can purchase that product or service. The company receives a fixed fee every time a customer clicks on a deal. During the period under study, this was the primary source of revenue for the focal firm. Thus, from the perspective of the focal firm, a click on a deal constitutes the financially relevant measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Description of the Data</head><p>We obtained data for a set of individuals registered in the New York City area. We focus on the cohort of customers that signed up for the service during February 2012 and track their behavior for 2.5 months. Excluding the days on which the company did not send any emails, 7 this observation window includes 66 periods. (A period is a day on which a customer could have received an email.) The vast majority of the customers in our data set received an email each period, with the few exceptions (accounting for less than 2% of the customer periods) occurring when there were no available deals in the selected categories on a particular day.</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> Because the most common method of unsubscribing from the email service is by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email, we allow a customer to unsubscribe only on those days on which she received an email and she opened the email. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Each period the company tracks whether an email was sent to the customer, whether she opened it, which deals she clicked on (if any), and whether she unsubscribed from the service. As more than 90% of the emails were opened on the same day they were sent, <ref type="bibr">9</ref> we do not model the delay from the date the email was sent to the date it was opened (i.e., if an email was opened, we assume it was opened on the same day in which it was sent). We randomly select 1,000 individuals who opened at least one email and who did not unsubscribe from the service on the same day they joined (consistent with the firm's definition of a "customer"). Hence, we observe customers for a minimum of two and a maximum of 66 periods.</p><p>In each period, we observe three possible behaviors: opening, clicking, and unsubscribing. In addition, we observe some characteristics of the deals offered, including the size of the discount, where in the email the deal appeared (i.e., its positional order in the email), the source from which the deal could be purchased (e.g., Groupon, LivingSocial), the product category (e.g., food, bar, fitness, travel), and the time left (in days) for the customer to purchase the deal before it expired. Customers tended to select multiple categories; in our sample, 98% of customers chose two or more categories (with an average of 22 and a median of 18). During the period of study, emails included an average of 9.2 deals. This distribution was very concentrated at 10 deals (76.8% of the emails).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Patterns in the Data</head><p>During our observation window, a total of 50,852 emails were sent to the 1,000 randomly selected customers, of which 27.4% were opened, and 5.4% were clicked on at least once. Conditional on being opened, 19.8% of emails were clicked on. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We observe that customers were heterogeneous in their responses to the firm's emails: while some customers almost never opened an email, others opened every email they received. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the summary statistics, across observations and across customers, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the histograms of the proportions of emails opened and clicked across customers.</p><p>In addition to cross-sectional heterogeneity with respect to opening and clicking behavior, customers also vary in their opening and clicking behavior over time. The majority of customers show high levels of activity immediately after joining the service followed by a quick decline in both opening and clicking. These are commonly observed patterns of behavior in noncontractual settings (e.g., Fader et al. 2010, Schwartz  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the evolution of the empirical probabilities of opening and clicking from the day the customer joined the firm. Note that while the probability of opening (the leftmost figure) continues declining over time, the probability of clicking given opening (the rightmost figure) stabilizes after approximately 15 periods. The probability of clicking (the middle figure) is simply the product of the other two quantities.</p><p>During our observation window, 8.8% of the customers unsubscribed from the service, with the average time to unsubscribing being 22 periods after signing up. The probability of unsubscribing dropped slightly after the first two or three periods of joining the service and remained fairly stable thereafter.</p><p>To explore whether or not unsubscribers differ in their opening and clicking behaviors from those customers who did not unsubscribe, we compute the period-by-period empirical probabilities of opening, clicking, and clicking given opening for each group. To ensure that we have enough observations in each group, we focus on those customers who lasted at least 15 periods. If a customer unsubscribed anytime from period 16 to period 25 (i.e., within the 10 periods following the 15-period observation window considered above), they are coded as "unsubscribe"; otherwise, they are coded as "do not unsubscribe." The periodby-period empirical probabilities for these two groups are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Let us make four observations. First, as depicted in the leftmost graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we see that unsubscribers open more emails than those who stay with the service. This observation is counter to the common finding in contractual settings that churners tend to exhibit lower activity levels prior to churning relative to customers who do not churn (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ascarza and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hardie 2013, Lemmens and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Croux 2006)</ref>. Second, the opening propensity of customers who do not unsubscribe continues to decline over time. We postulate and later demonstrate that this pattern occurs because the group of customers who do not unsubscribe is composed of not only customers who are satisfied and engaged with the firm but also a (possibly large) group Third, looking at the probability of clicking given opening (the rightmost graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), we see that once the email has been opened, unsubscribers click less than "stayers," suggesting that they do not find the content of the email attractive. Taken together, these two patterns seem to suggest that unsubscribers repeatedly open emails, get disappointed by the content (as reflected by the lack of clicking on emails opened), and eventually unsubscribe. Finally, looking at clicking behavior alone (the middle graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), we see that it is almost impossible to differentiate between churners and stayers. Herein lies a word of caution for researchers and analysts working with email marketing: unconditional clicking (or purchasing measures that ignore email opening or website visitation) could be a misleading metric when analyzing churn. It also highlights the need to collect the intermediate measure of opening and not just clicking behavior. Thus, the above model-free analysis suggests that treating such hybrid-setting data as coming from a contractual setting, and hence ignoring latent churners, inadvertently combines two distinct groups of customers-those who are still active and those who have silently churned-which can result in an erroneous understanding of the firm's customer base and the effects of marketing efforts. Treating such data as purely noncontractual, and hence ignoring those who overtly churn, would miss the opportunity for the firm to detect unsubscribing behavior. As we can see, there are meaningful predictors of unsubscribing in our data (e.g., higher opening rates and lower clicking conditional on opening rates).</p><p>Several limitations are associated with the modelfree evidence presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. First, we are making inferences about individual-level dynamics from aggregate-level data without controlling for heterogeneity-induced survivor bias. Second, the analysis of dynamics is based on a grouping of customers in terms of their future behavior. Hence, while interesting, the  Periods since acquisition patterns described are only suggestive. Moreover, the model-free analysis does not account for the possibility that the group of stayers could include a group of customers who have silently churned in addition to those customers who are actively engaged with the firm. Our proposed modeling framework overcomes these problems by incorporating dynamics and heterogeneity at the individual level and by measuring the effect of the relevant covariates in each of the processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Model Specification</head><p>We now discuss the covariates included in each part of the model. Recall that the main components of the model are the three observed behaviors (open, click, and unsubscribe) and the latent state membership (affecting each of the three behaviors) that is allowed to change over time. While some covariates are likely to affect customer activity only immediately (e.g., customers might be more/less prone to interact with the service during the weekend, or customers are more likely to click on heavily discounted deals), other variables might affect behavior in future periods as well. For example, if a customer is continually exposed to low-quality deals, she is not only unlikely to click on that particular deal when she opens the email but also less likely to open emails in the future. We account for both of these types of effects by incorporating variables that are expected to have a shortterm/immediate effect via the state-dependent equations (i.e., ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">7</ref>)) and variables that are likely to have a future impact via the transition equations (i.e., (2)).</p></div>

Therefore, with reference to (5), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">x o it [Sunday].</formula><p>Once a customer has opened an email, the decision to click on any of the deals offered is likely to be affected by the quality of the deals she observes. Rather than estimating the probability of clicking on a particular deal, we estimate the probability of clicking on at least one of the deals contained in the email 11 and incorporate in the clicking model a measure of the overall quality of the deals contained in the email.</p><p>We assume that each deal provides the user with the utility z i jt Î» c k + i jt , where z i jt includes the characteristics of deal j offered to customer i at time t, Î» c k captures customer preferences over those characteristics, given that the customer belongs to state k, and i jt is a zero mean stochastic shock. Note that we allow customers in different states to derive different value from the deals. For example, customers at risk of overtly churning may pay more attention to the degree of discount offered in the deal. Our measure of the overall quality of deals is the expected utility across the N it deals contained in the email received by customer i in period t, computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">N it j 1 z i jt Î» c k .</formula><p>For each deal, we observe the following six attributes: discount applied by the vendor (coded as the proportion of the price that has been discounted), the number of days until the deal expires (denoted as time left), whether the deal includes a foodor fitness-related product/service (coded as dummy variables), the log of the positional order in which the deal was shown to the customer (where 1 corresponds to the deal shown at the top of the email, 2 corresponds to the second deal, and so on), and the vendor from which the deal was collected (e.g., LivingSocial, Groupon). To keep the number of parameters manageable, we represent the 54 different vendors in our data via a continuous measure, source, that captures the prevalence of a particular vendor (i.e., how often the vendor appears in the deals' website emails). We operationalize source as the log of the number of times deals from each vendor were offered by the focal company. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> reports the summary statistics for the deal characteristic variables.</p><p>In addition to considering the expected utility of the deals offered in each email, we control for two other factors that could influence the state-specific probability of clicking: the day of the week on which the email was sent (using a Sunday dummy as above) and the size of the email (using the log of the number of deals in the email). We therefore rewrite (6) for this empirical application as Finally, regarding unsubscribing behavior, we would expect it to be affected by the overall nature of the deals shown in the email. We capture this by including the average characteristics of all of the deals contained in the email received in that period. We also allow the probability of unsubscribing on a particular day to be affected by whether or not the deal was offered on Sunday and by the log of the number of deals offered in the email received that day.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">State Transitions.</head><p>As discussed previously, while some variables (e.g., day of the week) are likely to shift behavior only in the short run, other variables might also affect future actions. For example, a customer who has repeatedly been exposed to low-quality deals may be more likely to transition to a latent state associated with a higher probability of overtly churning, or she might be less prone to open emails in the future, silently leaving the firm. While we could incorporate the effect of the average characteristics of all attributes in the deals, as we did in the unsubscribing submodel, such a specification would imply K(K â 1) parameters per deal attribute variable, with K being the number of states. We therefore opt for a more parsimonious measure of overall deal quality.</p><p>We model such an effect by incorporating a "stock" variable, which captures the effect of the overall quality of the deals the customer has been exposed to, in the state transition equation. We create this variable in the following manner. First, we create a measure of deal "popularity" by computing the proportion of customers (from outside our sample) exposed to each deal who clicked on the deal (given opening). <ref type="bibr">12</ref> For each email a customer receives, we compute its overall quality (Quality it ) by taking the average of the "popularity" of all of the deals contained in the email. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Finally, we create the quality stock variable that captures the effect of the quality of the current and previous emails by using an exponential smoothing function, similar to the adstock variable commonly used to measure advertising carryover (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Danaher et al. 2008)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">QualStock it ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ (1 â Ï)Quality it + Ï QualStock i(tâ1) , if y o i(tâ1) 1, Ï QualStock i(tâ1) , if y o i(tâ1) 0, (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">)</formula><p>where Quality it is the average quality (as measured by popularity) of the deals shown in the email sent to customer i in period t, and Ï measures the level of "memory." 14 Because the content of an email in period t affects the transition among states between periods t and t + 1, we include the one-period lag of this stock variable (QualStock i(tâ1) ) in the transition equations for period t.</p><p>In addition to the quality stock variable, we control for the rare occasions in which a customer did not receive an email on a particular day, by incorporating a Number of periods since last email variable in the transition equations.

(See Online Appendix B1 for the results of the two-state and four-state specifications and a discussion of the differences and similarities.) While we did not use the holdout sample for model selection purposes, we report the (out-of-sample) predictive performance of each specification. Specifically, we report the MSE, which aggregates prediction error across all three behaviors, and the area under the curve (AUC), which measures the accuracy of identifying customers who are more likely to overtly churn. In terms of out-of-sample prediction, the model with four states has the lowest MSE, while the model with three states has the best AUC.</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">x q it [Lag(</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.5.1.</head><p>Characterizing the Latent States. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref> presents the posterior means and 95% central posterior intervals (CPIs) of the probabilities of opening, clicking, and unsubscribing for each of the hidden states. For ease of interpretation, we report probabilities instead of the underlying model parameters. These probabilities were computed for a typical day, defined as a weekday in which an email with "average" deals was sent. Customers in state 2 appear to be the most active customers. Upon receiving an email, the mean probability that a customer in state 2 opens it is 0.520, and the probability of clicking on at least one deal is 0.234. These propensities are much higher than the simple averages across the entire customer base reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. These are the most profitable customers for the company as they have the highest clicking rates. At the other extreme, customers in state 3 rarely open an email (Prob(Open) 0.053) and rarely unsubscribe from the service (Prob(Unsubscribe) = 0.001). These customers seem to have the minimal level of interaction with the firm. Customers in state 1 exhibit interesting behavior, as evidenced by their high propensity to open emails (Prob(Open) 0.561) but low propensity to click on the same emails. The propensity of customers in state 1 to unsubscribe from the service is five times that of customers in states 2 or 3. Note that the 95% CPIs for the state 1 unsubscribe probabilities do not overlap with those of the other states, implying that customers in state 1 have a significantly higher propensity to unsubscribe than customers in either of the other two states.</p><p>Dynamics in customer behavior are captured by allowing customers to transition among the latent states. We compute the posterior distribution of the elements of the transition matrix for each individual (i.e., Q it ). (For ease of interpretation, we compute Q it for a typical day in which the Lag(QualStock) variable corresponds to the average in the data and the number of periods since the last email is set to 1.) We then compute the posterior means of these quantities for each individual and report the average and the 95% heterogeneity interval across all individuals. 17 These quantities are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref> and should be interpreted in the following manner. With respect to the middle two rows, an "average" individual in state 2 (the high-activity state) has a 0.728 probability of remaining in that state in the next period, a 0.099 probability of switching to state 1, and a 0.173 probability of switching to state 3. Individuals vary substantially in their propensity to transition between states, as evidenced by the 95% heterogeneity intervals. We observe that state 3 is very "sticky"; that is, once a customer enters this low-activity state, it is very unlikely that she will move to a different state. Also, note that there is very little heterogeneity on that dimension, with 95% of the sample having a probability of staying in state 3 between 0.865 and 0.998. State 1, on the other hand, is less sticky, with only a 50.3% chance of staying in the same state in the next period; however, this probability is very heterogeneous across customers.</p><p>Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> shows the posterior probabilities for the initial conditions for the relationship states in period 1. Not surprisingly, and given that we analyzed customer behavior since the moment they joined the company, the large majority of customers started their relationship with the company in the state with the highest levels of opening and clicking activity (state 2).</p><p>Combining the insights from the results presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4-6</ref>, we can now label the states. State 2 is characterized by a high propensity to both open and click. propensity to open an email but a lower propensity to click given that an email was opened and, interestingly, the highest propensity to unsubscribe. The pattern of behavior of these customers is similar to that reported for the unsubscribers group in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Thus, customers in this state are not disengaged from the firm-after all, they are opening emails-but they do not seem to find what they are looking for, which puts them at a higher risk of unsubscribing. We therefore name this the "at risk" state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.">Covariate Effects.</head><p>We now discuss how changes in the firm's product offering as well as external factors affect customer behavior, both in the short term (affecting the state-dependent behaviors) and in the longer term (affecting the transition probabilities).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariate effects on the state-dependent behaviors.</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref> reports the posterior means and 95% CPIs for the effects of the covariates on each behavior. Recall from Section 3 that we allow the covariate effects to be state specific. Hence, the effects of the same covariate might vary across columns, depending on which state the customer occupies. Regarding opening behavior, "at risk" customers are more likely to open emails on Sundays than on weekdays, whereas the "engaged" customers are more likely to open emails on weekdays than on Sundays.</p><p>Regarding clicking behavior, we also find that customers in different states exhibit different responses to the covariates. Customers in the "engaged" state are sensitive to the characteristics of the featured deals. Interestingly, preferences for some deal characteristics vary across states. For example, both "at risk" and "engaged" customers click significantly more on deals with greater discounts; the magnitude of such an effect is much larger for customers in the "engaged" state than for those in the "at risk" state (0.12 versus 0.29). Customers in the "engaged" state are also more likely to click as the number of deals in an email increases, whereas customers in the other two states are not significantly affected by the number of deals included in the email. These differences in sensitivity to deal characteristics are important for managers interested in tailoring the content of an email to specific segments to increase customer profitability. We explore different options as to how to alter the content of the email and its consequences in Section 4.5.4.  Finally, "engaged" customers are less likely to unsubscribe from emails that include deals from popular sources, whereas this variable has no significant effect on unsubscribing behavior of customers in the other two states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariate effects on the state transition probabilities.</head><p>We now describe the effect of past email content, as measured by the stock variable, on the (latent) state transition probabilities. For ease of exposition, we present the magnitude of these effects by reporting the average (across individuals) of the posterior means of each individual's transition probabilities for different levels of the quality stock variable. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The "default" case corresponds to the transition matrix shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, in which we use the average value for the quality stock variable. We operationalize high (better deals) and low (worse deals) levels of Lag(QualStock) as plus or minus one standard deviation around the average in the data.</p><p>The transition probabilities for each of the three scenarios are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref>. First, consider the average impact of the quality of past emails for customers belonging to the "at risk" state (first row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">8</ref>). Exposure to better deals makes "at risk" customers more likely to transition to the "engaged" state. (The average transition probability increasing from 0.185 to 0.226 is statistically significant at the 5% level.) This shows that even though we did not find an immediate impact of the deal characteristic on unsubscribing behavior (no significant effects on the first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref>), sending better deals to "at risk" customers can prevent unsubscribing (in future occasions) as better deals can move customers from the "at risk" state to the "engaged" state, where the probability of unsubscribing is notably lower. Regarding the already "engaged" customers (second row of the transition matrix), these effects are less pronounced. Nevertheless, we find that being exposed to better deals reduces the average probability of moving from "engaged" to "silently gone" (with the transition probability decreasing from 0.173 to 0.152). Finally, for the customers that already are in the "silently gone" state, we find a very weak, almost negligible, impact of offering better deals.</p><p>The effect of the deal quality stock variable on the state transition probabilities provides further support for our characterization of the latent states in three primary ways. First, the quality of emails influences a customer's propensity to move from the "at risk" to the "engaged" state. This finding corroborates our first assertion that the "at risk" state does not represent customers who are just not interested in purchasing (i.e., browsers who would never click) but rather captures those who were not able to find what they wanted. Second, customers are less likely to transition from the "engaged" to the "silently gone" state when they receive emails with better deals, providing further evidence that the "engaged" and "silently gone" states are not fixed underlying customer traits. Finally, customers in the "silently gone" state are not affected by changes in the content of the emails. This effect is not surprising as this state consists of customers who almost never open their emails.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3.">Relationship State Recovery.</head><p>We can also use the parameter estimates to compute the probability of each customer belonging to each state at any time period. We use the smoothing approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zucchini and MacDonald 2009)</ref> to calculate the probability that customer i is in state k in period t. The smoothing probability is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">P(S it k | y i1 , . . . , y iT i ) ÏM i1 Q i2 M i2 â¢ â¢ â¢ q .k it m it | k q k. i(t+1) â¢ â¢ â¢ Q iT i M iT i K / i , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">)</formula><p>where q .k it is the kth column of the transition matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">Q it , m it | k is the kth diagonal element of M it , q k.</formula><p>it is the kth row of Q it , and i is the likelihood of the observed sequence of customer i's behavior, as given in (11). Averaging these probabilities across customers gives us an estimate of the proportion of the customer base in each state at any time period. We plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> the evolution of these proportions over time since joining the service. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> also shows the proportion of customers who have overtly churned up to any given period (represented by the top bar).</p><p>Understanding the evolution of customers' state membership could help the manager better understand her customer base. For example, we find that the number of customers in the "engaged" state decreases during the first few periods, then stabilizes to less than 20% of the customer base. Similarly, while the share of "at risk" customers also decreases, it does so at a much slower rate relative to the "engaged" customers. It is interesting to note that even though on average a customer has only a 50% chance of remaining in the "at risk" state (recall the average transition probabilities from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>), there is a high degree of heterogeneity in that probability, with a stable group of customers who remain "at risk" for a long period of time. This pattern suggests that many customers might be at risk for quite a few periods before unsubscribing, which may offer the firm a window of opportunity to react. The remaining groups capture the proportion of customers churning-either overtly or silently-from the service. The top bar captures the proportion of customers who have already unsubscribed (i.e., "overtly churned") from the service by each period. Consistent with the nature of contractual relationships (i.e., once a customer unsubscribes, she is no longer a customer), and given that we analyze a cohort of customers, the size of this group is increasing over time. Unlike the overt churners, "silently gone" customers (second-totop bar in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>) are part of our data (as they keep receiving communications from the company) and are captured by one of the latent states. Consistent with the nearly absorbing nature of that latent state, the size of the "silently gone" group also increases in size over time, even more rapidly than the overt churners. It is apparent from the figure that customers of this service are more likely to leave silently than overtly.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> provides an illustration of how the model captures latent attrition while allowing the "still alive" customers to belong to different groups that evolve over time. Because the "silently gone" population is increasing over time, modeling our setting as a contractual setting-thus grouping together all customers who did not overtly churn-will significantly overstate the size of the truly active customer population. Furthermore, these insights can help marketers avoid keeping customers who are long gone in their communications database. This is especially relevant in email marketing settings because firms are increasingly interested in removing "dead" customers from their mailing lists to maximize the overall deliverability of their email communications. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Most importantly, combining these insights with those obtained in Section 4.5.2, our model offers clear guidance as to which marketing actions should be undertaken to increase activity among existing customers both in the short run (through increasing clicking behavior immediately) and in future periods (through changing the mix of customers via the latent states). In Section 4.5.4, we explore the options that the focal firm could implement (given their business model) to better manage its customer base and increase profitability.</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.4.">Actively Managing the Customer Base.</head><p>Putting all of the pieces together, our model identifies three latent states of behavior, which we characterize as "at risk," "engaged," and "silently gone." Customers in the "at risk" state open emails frequently but rarely click on any deals. Their probability of clicking on a deal is higher when deals offer greater discounts, yet their overall probability of clicking is very low. Customers in the "engaged" state are active email openers who also have a high propensity to click on deals. They are more likely to click on emails containing deals that offer high discounts, contain more deals, or that have more days before expiring. They tend to prefer fitness-related deals and click less when the deal is food related. In addition to having different clicking patterns, "engaged" customers also differ from "at risk" customers in their significantly lower propensity to unsubscribe (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>). Interestingly, the quality of deals that customers are exposed to has an effect above and beyond the immediate actions of opening, clicking, and unsubscribing. We find that by sending emails with better deals, "at risk" customers have a higher chance of becoming "engaged," which determines their behavior in future periods. Finally, those in the "silently gone" state do not exhibit any sign of activity and are very unlikely to change, as reflected by their negligible reaction to the email content and their nearly zero probability of transitioning to a different state.</p><p>A natural question to ask is whether the firm can use these insights to increase the activity and profitability of the existing customer base. To investigate this question, we conduct a set of counterfactual analyses, simulating customer behavior while varying the nature of the deals offered by the company to its customers. Recall that the focal company does not work directly with the vendors offering these deals but collects deals from other websites. Accordingly, the focal firm cannot alter the characteristics of the deals, but it can choose which deals to offer. Furthermore, given the large supply of deals in our context, the company can easily improve the deal offering by better matching deals to customers with the objective of increasing clicking behavior and reducing customers' probabilities of churning, either silently or overtly. Therefore, in our counterfactual analyses we measure the impact of improving the deal offerings on opening, clicking, and unsubscribing behavior, as well as on reducing latent attrition by preventing customers from transitioning to the "silently gone" state.</p><p>We select customers who had not unsubscribed by the end of the calibration period and predict their behavior under three different scenarios: (1) status quo, which assumes the company provides the same deals as we observe in the data, (2) better deals, which assumes that the company selects the most popular deals and sends them to every subscriber, and (3) personalized emails, which assumes the company personalizes the emails based on the (hidden) state the customer belongs to at the end of the calibration period. We determine the hidden state to which each customer belongs by first calculating her state membership probabilities using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">14</ref>) and then assigning her to a state if the probability of belonging to that state is greater than 0.8. <ref type="bibr">20 , 21</ref> The way we operationalize the second and third scenarios is by selecting deals from the pool of deals we observe in the data. (This mimics the way the company operates by selecting deals from those available in the market.) More specifically, the deals for the second scenario are drawn from the pool of deals with the highest popularity, as described in Section 4.3. For scenario 3, we rely on the parameter estimates from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">7</ref> and create three pools of deals, one for each hidden state. The "at risk" pool contains deals that offer a high discount, do not offer food-related products, and have a lower number of days to be purchased. The "engaged" pool also contains high discount deals, but the deals are more likely to be for fitness services and have more days left for the deal to be purchased. Moreover, because "engaged" customers prefer more (rather than fewer) deals, engaged customers in scenario 3 are offered 15 deals instead of 10. Finally, the "silently gone" pool contains shorter, lower discount deals that are not food related.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> depicts the impact of each of the scenarios on customers in each of the latent states in terms of their observed behaviors (opening, clicking, and unsubscribing) over 12 periods (i.e., two weeks excluding Saturdays). The leftmost column shows the effect of the company actions on customers who are in the "at risk" state at the end of the calibration period, the middle column shows those in the "engaged" state, and the rightmost column shows those in the "silently gone" state. The y-axes represent the difference in the probability of the behavior (open, click, and unsubscribe in rows 1, 2, and 3, respectively) between the default (scenario 1) and each of the other scenarios in which the company is improving the quality of its offerings (0 implies no change).</p><p>Let us start by analyzing clicking (second row), as this behavior is directly linked to the company's bottom line. Not surprisingly, the company can increase clicks, hence, profits, among its current customers by choosing the deals it will offer in a more selective manner. By simply offering better deals (scenario 2), click rates increase by 1 percentage point among "at risk" customers and by 5 percentage points among "engaged" customers. The increase in click rates is significantly larger when the company leverages the insights from the model regarding the customers' state   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Better deals Personalized emails</head><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> membership and tailors the deal offered based on the hidden states customers belong to (scenario 3). In this case, the increase in click rates are 5 and 10 percentage points for customers in the "at risk" and "engaged" states, respectively (leftmost figures in the second row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). The effects on opening behavior are less obvious because the impact of the policies on opening behavior takes time to pick up. This is because improving the quality of deals cannot impact opening directly (as customers need to open the email first to see the quality of the deals offered), but affects future behavior by altering the hidden state customers belong to. We find that improving the quality of the deals offered increases opening rates among "engaged" customers over time. This pattern is driven by the impact of the policies on the probability of moving to the "silently gone" state (last row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). Indeed we find that improving the quality of the deals reduces the probability of "engaged" customers of silently leaving the firm.</p><p>Finally, consistent with our previous results and with our characterization of state 3 (the "silently gone" state), we find that improving the product offering has little to no effect on customers who are silently gone. These customers rarely interact with the service, meaning that they would not be aware of the changes in quality of the deals offered. The firm would need to find other means of "saving" these customers, to the extent that doing so is at all possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Assessing Predictive Performance Relative to</head><p>Benchmark Models We now compare the out-of-sample predictions (over the one-month validation period) generated by our model with those generated using both simpler versions of our model specification and more traditional approaches that model behavior as a function of past behavior and/or lagged covariates. In selecting our benchmark models, we choose models commonly used to predict (overt) churn in contractual settings while controlling for the effect of past levels of activity. 22 Accordingly, our benchmark models include models that remove the latent dynamics offered by the HMM and replace them with observed dynamics using lagged covariates and/or recency and frequency (RF) measures. Such models are constructed by estimating a single-state HMM and augmenting the vectors of covariates x o it , x c it , and x u it in (5)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">7</ref>). (Further details of the model specifications and the full set of results are provided in Online Appendix B3.) Additionally, we estimate a static benchmark version of our HMM in which transitions between states are not allowed.</p><p>We consider four benchmark models:</p><p>â¢ Lagged covariates, in which the opening, clicking, and unsubscribing behaviors are modeled as a function of x u it , x o it , and x c it , augmented by x q it , as well as the lagged values of these covariates.</p><p>â¢ RF (no covariates), in which the opening, clicking, and unsubscribing behaviors are modeled as a function of four recency/frequency variables: rec o it , freq o it , rec c it , and freq c it . <ref type="bibr">23</ref> We specify the recency and frequency variables in the following manner. The variable freq o it is computed as the proportion of emails customer i has opened up to (and including) period t â 1, and rec o it represents the number of periods since customer i last opened an email. Similarly, freq c it is computed as the proportion of emails customer i has clicked up to (and including) period t â 1, and rec c it measures the number of periods since customer i last clicked an email.</p><p>â¢ RF (covariates), in which the opening, clicking, and unsubscribing behaviors are modeled as a function of x u it , x o it , and x c it , and the four recency/frequency variables defined above.</p><p>â¢ HMM (static), in which transitions between states are not allowed (i.e., Q it is the identity matrix). This is simply a finite-mixture model with three latent classes and continuous heterogeneity in the opening and clicking behavior within class.</p><p>All four specifications are estimated using a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo hierarchical Bayes procedure. We tested multiple specifications for unobserved individual heterogeneity by estimating a "fullheterogeneity" model that incorporates a random effect for each of the three behaviors as well as the nested specifications incorporating heterogeneity in opening and clicking only, opening only, or no heterogeneity. When estimating the RF specifications, we find that the fit of the most restricted version (no random effect) is notably better than that of all other specifications. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> As with our proposed model, we estimate all of the benchmark models using the calibration-period data and assess the prediction for each of the three observed behaviors in the validation period. Note that the RFbased model can only provide one-period-ahead predictions, as the recency and frequency variables summarize behavior up to and including the most recent period. We therefore use actual behavior from the validation period to update these variables.</p><p>We compute the MSE at the individual/period level and then the MAPE at the period level for the predictions of each of the three behaviors. We also compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to assess how well the model identifies customers who are more likely to unsubscribe. The greater the area under the curve, the more accurately the model separates potential churners from those who are more likely to stay. Because we estimate the models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we perform this customer-level forecasting exercise for each draw of the Markov chain (after the burn-in period), compute the measures of fit per draw, and report the averages across the draws. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">9</ref> reports the error measures for all of the models, sorted by their accuracy in predicting These results suggest that while the RF models do well at predicting the total number of opens and clicks on any given day, the proposed model performs better at identifying which customers are more likely to open, click, or unsubscribe (lowest MSE and highest AUC) as well as predicting the total number of unsubscribers. These results are to be expected as the RF models do not separate the two types of churn (overt and silent) and hence cannot accurately identify the antecedents of unsubscribing behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Empirical Application 2: Performing Arts Organization</head><p>We explore the generalizability of the insights derived from analyzing the daily deal website data by applying our model to data from a very different context. The data come from a performing arts organization located in New York City. Like most arts organizations, the company keeps the list of all patrons (hereafter, customers) who have subscribed to their email service.</p><p>A customer joins the email list by either buying a ticket (and providing her email address) or by actively subscribing to the newsletter via the company's website.</p><p>Approximately once a month, the company sends an email to all subscribers. The company generally sends one of two types of emails: (i) "ticket" emails, containing information about upcoming performances and links to the organization's website where tickets can be purchased, and (ii) "information" emails, containing information about performances that have already been announced or about other issues related to the organization. Approximately once a year, the organization sends a "donation" email in which all subscribers are reminded that they can support the organization by donating money. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> As with the first application, attrition is observed for some customers and is latent for others-customers can unsubscribe from the mailing list or simply ignore emails from the firm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Description of the Data</head><p>For each email sent by the organization, we observe which customers received the email, whether or not they opened the email and clicked on any content, and whether they unsubscribed from the email service. We have access to 20 months of email activity, ranging from July 2012 to February 2014. In contrast to our first application, we do not observe the entire history of these customers. As a result of a change in email providers, the company does not know when (prior to July 2012) these members joined the email list and has no record of their pre-July 2012 activity. For the purposes of our analysis, we focus on those customers who opened at least one email during the first year of the data and ignore those customers who unsubscribed in the first observation window. We randomly selected 1,000 customers to estimate our model. As with our first application, each period corresponds to an instance in which an email was sent to a customer. During our 20-month observation window, the number of emails received ranged from 2 to 25 (which means we have 2 to 25 observations per customer); on average, a customer received 22.2 emails (with a standard deviation of 5.2). During our observation window, 66.7% of the emails were "ticket" emails, 22.2% were "information" emails, and the remaining 11.1% were "donation" emails. The email type is easily inferred by customers (and by us) from the subject line. Unlike the previous application, customers who unsubscribe from this service can still purchase tickets either from the website or from the ticket office (i.e., customers in this setting do not need to be email subscribers to buy tickets). We collected data from the ticket office on all of the ticket purchases by our sample of customers during the period of study and will use these data to validate the (hidden) states identified by our model in Section 5.5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Patterns in the Data</head><p>We observe 22,174 emails sent to our sample of 1,000 customers, of which 25.9% were opened and 3.3% were clicked. (Conditional on being opened, 12.6% of the emails were clicked.) Consistent with our previous application, customers are very heterogeneous in their propensity to open and click, with the percentage of emails opened ranging from 3.7% to 100.0%. More than half of the customers never clicked on an email, and approximately 15% of the customers clicked on every email they received. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref> shows the summary statistics, across observations and across individuals. These summary statistics are very comparable with those of our first empirical application (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>During our observation window, 7.6% of the customers unsubscribed from the service. The average time to unsubscribing was 12 periods after the start of the observation period. We note that the aggregate churn rate does not systematically decrease or increase over time. This is not surprising given that we are dealing with a pool of customers acquired at different points in time.</p><p>In a manner similar to that in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we split the sample in terms of whether or not the customer unsubscribed between periods 16 and 25 and explore Period the dynamics in customer activity in periods <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Despite the notable differences between these two contexts-daily deal website versus performing arts organization-and despite the fact that customers are observed at different points in their lifetime, the patterns observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> are strikingly similar to those observed for the daily deal website in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. In this data set, we once again observe that unsubscribers have a higher probability of opening emails and a lower probability of clicking given opening compared to those customers who do not unsubscribe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Model Specification and Selecting the Number of States</head><p>To account for systematic differences in opening, clicking, and unsubscribing depending on the type of email, we include email type as a covariate (in the form of dummy variables) affecting all three behaviors as well as the transition matrix. With reference to the notation introduced in Section 3, <ref type="bibr">26</ref> We estimate the model varying the number of states from one to four and compute multiple measures of fit. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> With reference to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>, we see that the four-state model has the highest log predictive density and the lowest WAIC and MAPE, and that the three-state model has the lowest MSE. For parsimony and ease of comparison across the two applications, we present the results for the three-state model. It is important to note that both the three-state and fourstate models provide very similar insights regarding customer behavior. 28</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">x o it x c it x u it x q it [Ticket, Donation].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Results</head><p>In the interest of brevity, we summarize only the key results and discuss the insights relevant to both applications. (See Online Appendix C for a full set of results.) Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref> presents the posterior means and 95% CPIs for  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13</ref>), we see that state 3 is very sticky. The probabilities of staying in either of the other two states are also quite high.  Once again we have found three very distinct states of behavior in this customer base: the "engaged" customers (state 2) who actively engage with the service, as shown by their high clicking probabilities; the "silently gone" customers (state 3), who do not interact with the firm (either by opening an email or unsubscribing); and the customers who are more "at risk" of terminating their relationship with the company (state 1), with a high probability of opening their emails (higher than those belonging to the other two states), a lower probability of clicking on any of the content of the email than those in the "engaged" group, and the highest risk of unsubscribing from the email service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Validation of the States</head><p>Unlike the first empirical application, customers of this organization can buy tickets without being subscribed to the email service. Stated differently, it is possible for customers who appear to be silently gone or who have unsubscribed from the email list to keep purchasing tickets from the organization. Thus, churning from the email communication may not mean a complete termination of the relationship with the organization. If that is the case, the implications derived from our analysis could be misleading, as these customers might still be of value to the company. To investigate this issue, we collected additional data on individual ticket purchases. We obtained box office data from the beginning of our observation window until three months after the last email was sent and extracted the records for the customers in our sample. Note that this information was not incorporated in our analysis thus far, and was never used by the company to determine email strategies. In fact, the two data sets reside in different departments within the organization. Accordingly, we can use these purchase data to validate the "silently gone" state and overt churn behavior.</p><p>Our main goal is to validate our findings by examining whether the latent states (inferred from changes in opening, clicking, and unsubscribing behaviors) relate to actual purchase behavior. First, we investigate whether customers who overtly churn (unsubscribe from the service) continue purchasing tickets. In other words, we want to confirm that unsubscribing in this setting is a good proxy for true customer churn. We find that, while the customers who unsubscribed during our observation window had purchased tickets prior to unsubscribing, none of these customers ever purchased a ticket after unsubscribing. Second, we analyze actual purchase behavior by customers belonging to each of the hidden states. We use our model predictions to predict the state ("at risk," "silently gone," or "engaged") a customer belongs to in each period in the calibration sample. We then cross-tabulate that information with the number of transactions a customer made during that period. We report in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">14</ref> Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref>  the average number of transactions made by the individuals assigned to each state, along with the limits of the 95% interval. We observe that the average number of transactions is significantly higher for customers in the "engaged" state, with "silently gone" customers representing the lowest transaction propensity. Thus, our purchase data validate the notion that customers in the "engaged" state are most likely not only to respond to the company's email communications but also to purchase tickets. Furthermore, we find that customers "at risk" rarely buy tickets from the company, despite having the highest rate of email opening. Customers who churned overtly from the email communication also did so in terms of purchases. Because we did not use the ticket purchasing data when calibrating the model and identifying the customers' latent states, we believe this analysis shows that the states identified by our model using email engagement data reflects customer purchase behavior in the form of monetary transactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we have examined customer behavior in hybrid contractual/noncontractual settings where the loss of some customers is observed by the firm while the loss of others is unobserved. To accommodate both types of attrition, we propose a HMM that allows us to separate those customers who are engaged with the firm from those who are at risk of churning overtly and those who are silently gone. The model captures customer dynamics in the level of engagement and in the risk of leaving the company by allowing customers to transition among latent states. Moreover, the model measures the impact of factors such as the quality of the firm's communications on the individual transitions between states, as well as on customer behavior given state membership.</p><p>We apply the model to two different business settings-a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. While these two contexts promote and sell very different types of goods and services, target different sets of customers, and communicate at very different time intervals, they both share the commonality that customers can choose to stop interacting with the organization either by unsubscribing from the email list (i.e., overtly churning) or by simply ignoring incoming emails from the organization (i.e., silently churning).</p><p>In the first application, the email communication is the product itself, and, thus, termination of the communications implies the end of any relationship with the firm. In the second application, unsubscribing implies termination of the email-based communications with the firm, but need not imply an end to event attendance. We validate our latent states by demonstrating that both overt and silent churn from the email communication also imply churn from monetary transactions.</p><p>In both empirical applications, we consistently find that the companies' customer bases can be characterized by three latent groups of customers, which we label "engaged," "silently gone," and those who are "at risk" of termination. In contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two types of churn, we find that in hybrid settings a high level of activitycaptured in our applications by actively opening the emails received from the firm-is not necessarily a good indicator of future profitability as it is associated with a higher risk of overtly churning.</p><p>Treating these settings as noncontractual (i.e., ignoring overt churn) will miss the opportunity to understand, predict, and manage this churn behavior. On the other hand, treating them as contractual settings (i.e., ignoring latent attrition) will mix together active and silently gone customers and miss the opportunity to manage each group appropriately. Moreover, by mixing these two types of customers, it becomes difficult to identify the factors/behaviors that predict overt churn because inactive customers will be seeing as stayers.</p><p>Using characteristics of the email content as covariates in both the state-dependent probabilities and in the state transition probabilities, we explore the antecedents of the two types of churn. We find that when engaged customers receive emails with better content, they are less likely to transition to the "silently gone" state. More customized emails can help reengage customers who are at risk of churning. Using a set of counterfactual analyses, we demonstrate that the firm could manage its customer base by transitioning customers to states with a lower risk of churn (overt or latent) and increase profitability from clicks.</p><p>In addition to providing superior predictions of customer behavior, our model offers several managerially relevant insights. We are able to identify those customers who are at risk of formally terminating their relationship with the firm (unsubscribers) and determine which of the remaining customers are silent churners. Because each type of churner raises different flags in terms of their behaviors, disentangling the two types of churn is crucial when guiding companies in their retention efforts. Across both applications, we highlight the importance of measuring and leveraging multiple dimensions of behavior. For example, if companies focus only on metrics that directly link to revenue-that is, focus on clicking and ignore opening behavior-their insights into customer churn will be misleading. For example, analyzing clicking behavior alone does not allow us to disentangle unsubscribers from stayers (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 and 6</ref>). Moreover, understanding the dynamics in opening behavior is also crucial for detecting those customers who are "silently gone."</p><p>This research is particularly relevant for managers involved in customer relationship management. We not only offer insights into customer behavior but also provide a tool for quantifying and predicting customer activity that can identify those who might be at risk of actively leaving the company and detecting those customers who should no longer be considered as part of the firm's active customer base. As we demonstrate, improving the product offering (i.e., the email content) might reduce the risk of unsubscribing. However, our results suggest that it is likely that such efforts would have little impact on a large portion of the customer base who are "silently gone" and are not expected to open any email in the future (and are thus unlikely to be exposed to the improved content). As a consequence, firms ought to think of different ways to reengage those customers classified as "silently gone." One approach would be to alter the header of emails, signaling to silently gone customers that the offerings have changed. Firms may also want to consider varying the frequency with which emails are sent or contact these customers through other channels. While our data are not rich enough to measure the impact of such marketing efforts, our proposed model could easily be used to measure their effects.</p><p>The managerial implications for email marketing are also noteworthy. Identifying silently gone customers is increasingly important for email marketing firms, who are interested in removing "dead" customers from their mailing lists so as to maximize the overall deliverability of their email communications by keeping their "sender ranking" at high levels (see, for example, Return Path 2014). Mailbox providers use recipients' engagement (email opening and clicking), or lack thereof, to determine whether to reroute the sender's emails to spam folders. Accordingly, identifying silently gone customers and removing them from the firm's email recipient list is crucial to the proper management of the list.</p><p>Our research builds on the existing literature on modeling customer attrition (e.g., for observed attrition, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ascarza et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Braun and Schweidel 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Neslin et al. 2006</ref>; for latent attrition, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fader et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Schweidel et al. 2014</ref>. We generalize existing methods by proposing a modeling framework that can accommodate both types of attrition. From a methodological perspective, it complements the growing literature in marketing that highlights the usefulness of HMMs for understanding customer dynamics in a variety of marketing problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ascarza and Hardie 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Montoya et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Netzer et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Schwartz et al. 2014</ref>). More broadly, our work also relates to the literature on email marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonfrer and DrÃ¨ze 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, DrÃ¨ze and Bonfrer 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Kumar et al. 2014</ref>, as email communications and newsletters are one example of hybrid settings.</p><p>With the popularity of free or freemium services, the number of hybrid settings in the marketplace is rapidly growing. In addition to the applications investigated in this research, there are many other business settings where the loss of some customers is observed by the firm while the loss of others is unobserved. Examples include social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Tinder), digital services (e.g., Dropbox, Gmail), online games, and the majority of apps. The customer activities observed in these contexts are not necessarily opening and clicking on emails, but rather log-ins, likes, review posts, friend requests, rounds played, in-app purchases, and so on. How would our modeling framework separate both types of churn when behaviors are different? First, incorporating these activities in our modeling framework is straightforward, as the HMM structure can be easily adapted to include as many state-dependent behaviors as needed. Second, our model will separate the two types of churn provided the observed behaviors (or a combination of them) enable us to discriminate between overt churners and engaged customers. For example, consider the case of a social network, one in which overt churn would be the closing of an account. Observed behaviors in this case would take the form of log-ins, searches, friend requests, and in-app messages. Our modeling framework would easily identify "silent churners" by very low levels of any activity. Customers "at risk" may be characterized by frequent log-ins and searches, but low levels of social activity in terms of building and increasing their social network (e.g., by inviting friends and accepting friend requests). We encourage future work that applies our modeling framework to these settings, as doing so would help managers better understand which behaviors should be tracked and leveraged.</p><p>While our model allows us to separate overt from silent churners, our data and modeling efforts shed little light on why some customers decide to churn overtly and others silently. We postulate that one of the reasons for churning overtly rather than silently could be the degree to which the customer is negatively affected by the amount and/or the content of the communication with the firm. For example, an offensive communication or total mismatch between the firm's communication and the customer preferences is more likely to lead to overt rather than silent churn. Because our data do not allow us to directly investigate this issue, we leave this for future research.</p><p>The current research provides a first step in exploring an emerging type of business setting, one in which <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 54-77, Â© 2018</ref> customers can decide whether to overtly or silently churn from the firm. Such settings break the traditionally defined distinction between contractual and noncontractual settings. We encourage future research to continue investigating these interesting settings and identify additional drivers that help distinguish between these two types of churners.</p><p>is lower), it was not possible for us to get reliable estimates when estimating the model with unobserved heterogeneity in all components. As a consequence, we estimate a model with unobserved heterogeneity in the transition probabilities and in opening behavior, but not in clicking and unsubscribing behavior. 28 See Online Appendix C for a detailed description of the four-state model results and a discussion of its consistency with the three-state model solution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Î¶ o k and Î¶ c k represent the average propensity (across the population) to open an email and to click on the email content (given opening), respectively, and Ï i {Ï o i , Ï c i } represents the individual-level heterogeneity in each of the two behaviors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endnotes</head><p>1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schmittlein et al. (1987)</ref> note that bank accounts, which may typically be thought of as being contractual in nature, can sometimes become permanently dormant due to customers forgetting or even physically dying and the bank being unaware of the customer churn. No-fee credit cards may be another such example. 2 Note that the duality investigated in this paper is different from that discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Braun and Schweidel (2011)</ref>: voluntary and involuntary churn. In their case, both types of churn are observed by the firm and the difference lies in who initiates the termination of the relationship (i.e., the customer or the firm). In hybrid settings, attrition is always the customer's choice; the difference lies in whether or not the company observes when the customer churns.</p><p>3 Note that latent attrition models can be formulated as (constrained versions of) a two-state HMM where one of the states is an absorbing state of (latent) attrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schwartz et al. 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We estimated an "absorbing" version of our main model in which one of the states was forced to be absorbing and all three behaviors in this state were forced to zero (no activity). The fit of this model specification was inferior to that of our proposed model specification. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Consistent with prior research using HMMs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Netzer et al. 2008</ref>, we assume that the number of latent states is common across all customers. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We do not include unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to unsubscribe because at most each customer unsubscribes once in the entire observation period, making such a heterogeneity specification empirically unidentified. 7 For example, the company did not send emails on Saturdays during our calibration period. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> In theory, a customer could go to the website and unsubscribe from there. However, given that such cases are extremely rare, the company codes such behavior as if the customer unsubscribed from the email sent on that day (or on the day before if no email was sent that day). Once a customer unsubscribes from the service, she stops receiving the emails, and she can no longer access the website to check or buy the available deals. To do so, she would need to subscribe again. 9 This pattern is consistent with that found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonfrer and DrÃ¨ze (2009)</ref>. 10 These figures are comparable with industry averages for that year <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Silverpop 2013</ref>). 11 While a customer can click on multiple deals in any given email, such behavior is rare. Of the emails clicked, 88% had one deal clicked, 9.51% had two deals clicked, and 2.4% had three or more deals clicked. We estimated a model in which we allowed the customer to click on more than one deal (using a shifted-Poisson distribution to characterize the number of deals clicked). The fit of this model specification was inferior to that of our proposed model specification. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We consider only opened emails as it is impossible for the customer to observe the quality of the offered deals without opening the email that contains the deals. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We standardize the quality variable such that Quality it 0 corresponds to an email of average quality. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> We estimate Ï using a grid search, with points 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. The results presented in Section 4.5 are associated with Ï 0.2, which provides a better fit to the data. We initialize the stock variable at zero, implying that QualStock it 0 if the customer has not opened any email up to and including period t. In other words, we initialize the quality stock variable at the level of an average email. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Log predictive density <ref type="bibr">(Gelman et al. 2013, p. 167</ref>) is computed as the posterior mean of the log-likelihood function evaluated in each draw of the Gibbs sampler. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> For each individual in each period for each of the three behaviors, the squared error is computed as the square of the difference between the probability of the behavior and the actual behavior (0/1). The mean is computed across individuals, periods, and the three behaviors. The absolute percentage error is computed at the period level and averaged across periods to give us MAPE. Specifically, we compute the absolute percentage error in predicting the total number of opens, clicks, and unsubscribers on a given day and then average across the three behaviors. 17 Note that the 95% heterogeneity interval captures heterogeneity of the transition probabilities across individuals rather than the parameters' precision. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The parameters associated with (2) are reported in Table <ref type="table">B1</ref> in Online Appendix B. 19 Among other things, mailbox providers use recipients' engagement with emails (email opening and clicking) from each sender to determine whether to reroute emails from the sender to the recipients' junk folder. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Our use of such a high cutoff means we are selecting customers for whom we are fairly certain as to which state they belong to. If a customer has no posterior probability greater than 0.8, we discard her from this analysis. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> For a customer who is not part of the calibration sample, state membership probabilities can be calculated by first computing her posterior distribution (given her observations and the populationlevel parameters from the calibration sample) and then using the resulting individual-level parameter values to evaluate (14). <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Comparing our model to those commonly used to predict churn in contractual settings gives us a sense of the (potential) loss in predictive ability due to the failure to separate overt churners from latent churners. Note that we do not compare the predictive ability of our model to that of the standard models for noncontractual settings, as such models are not able to predict unsubscribing behavior. Furthermore, such models typically model one behavior at a time as opposed to multiple behaviors (e.g., opening, clicking, and unsubscribing). <ref type="bibr">23</ref> We do not include a "monetary value" variable because, while the company would receive a higher fee when a customer clicks on more than one deal, such behavior is rare in our data. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> We present the best fitting model in Online Appendix B; all sets of results are available from the authors. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The company occasionally sends personalized emails to a small number of "elite" customers. These are emails inviting them to fundraising galas and similar events. Because these emails are rare and targeted at a very specific (and small) set of customers, we ignore these emails and exclude these customers from our analysis. 26 Information emails serve as the base category.</p></div>			</div>
