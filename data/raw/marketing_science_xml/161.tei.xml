<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Political advertising is a controversial topic, as there are widespread concerns about money distorting the democratic process and negative advertising reducing voter interest. Concerns about special interest groups using money to distort the democratic process have become increasingly prominent over the last decade as a result of increased spending by political action committees (PACs) and super PACs. Super PACs are particularly controversial because they do not have limits on individual contributions and because they operate independently of candidates. The independence of super PACs from candidates is a potentially important factor in advertising's effectiveness, as it may influence the perceived credibility of messages. The effect of negative advertising on voters is a long-standing question. In addition to questions about whether negative advertising is more powerful in terms of influencing preferences, there are also concerns about negative advertising reducing voter interest. Some studies have found that negative advertising can adversely affect voter turnout (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ansolabehere et al. 1994, Ansolabehere and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Iyengar 1995)</ref>, while others have found that it may stimulate voter turnout (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goldstein and Freedman 2002)</ref>. In this paper, we study two important political advertising issues. We investigate how the source and tone of advertising influence voter response.</p><p>Studying political advertising effectiveness is a challenging topic for several reasons. For example, a candidate's fund-raising and spending levels are likely to be endogenously determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gordon et al. 2012</ref>) because of factors that are not observable to researchers, such as attractiveness and personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hoegg and Lewis 2011)</ref>. The use of targeted advertising further increases concerns about endogeneity since money may be allocated based on the perceived competitiveness of races <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(O'Connor 2014)</ref>. It is also possible that candidates in noncompetitive races spend advertising dollars to accrue incremental political power or build brand equity, rather than to influence vote shares.</p><p>However, the practice of allocating advertising spend based on designated marketing areas (DMAs) may potentially facilitate analysis of political advertising effectiveness. When advertising is targeted based on 334 <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 333-355, Â© 2018</ref> DMAs, it creates a setting in which neighboring counties may receive different levels of advertising exposure. Under the assumption that neighboring counties tend to be similar markets, these discontinuities create a natural experiment. In this research, we leverage the advertising discontinuities along DMA borders within states to study the impact of political advertising based on ad source and message tone. The analysis uses a data set from the 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. The data include all advertisements aired in 210 DMAs, gross rating points for every ad, DMA-county geographic mapping, demographic information, and county-level votes. We apply a modified difference-indifference approach to estimate the effect of advertising using the border counties that conducted elections in 2010 and 2012. Our econometric specification includes fixed effects to control for possible persistent differences across counties.</p><p>By leveraging the variation in advertising created by DMA borders, we investigate political advertising effectiveness without having to make strong assumptions to control for endogenous spending or fundraising. We conduct the analysis sequentially and begin with a baseline specification that investigates the effectiveness of overall, undifferentiated political advertising spending. When the analysis is conducted without differentiating between ad tone or ad source, we find that advertising exposure (measured in gross rating points, or GRPs) is ineffective in affecting either two-party vote shares or mobilizing voters. We then extend the analysis to differentiate between positive and negative advertising effects. We find that negative political advertising has a significant positive effect on two-party vote shares. By contrast, positive political advertising is ineffective.</p><p>Our focal research question is concerned with potential interactions between ad source and message tone. There has been some speculation in the academic literature that advertising by super PACs may be more effective because these entities have neutral names and may be viewed as more credible sources relative to candidates who have clear self-interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Weber et al. 2012)</ref>. Alternatively, we conjecture that special interest groups such as super PACs may be less credible sources of information because these entities tend to be unknown and therefore lack brand equity.</p><p>Our key finding is that negative advertising sponsored by PACs is significantly less effective than that sponsored by candidates in terms of two-party vote shares and turnouts. This is a novel result that, to our knowledge, has not been documented previously in the literature on political advertising. In terms of two-party vote shares, we find that negative advertising GRPs from candidates are approximately twice as effective as advertising GRPs sponsored by PACs. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A 1% increase in negative advertising GRPs by PACs yields an approximately 0.004% increase in a candidate's two-party vote share, while a 1% increase in negative advertising by a candidate yields about a 0.008% increase. In terms of mobilizing voters, we find that negative advertising GRPs from candidates have a significant effect on voter turnout. A 1% increase in negative advertising GRPs by a candidate produces a 0.007% increase in turnout, while negative advertising sponsored by PACs are ineffective.</p><p>During the 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections, there was a significant correlation between turnout and Democratic candidate vote share. Therefore, we combine the effects on turnout and conditional two-party vote shares to quantify the impact on unconditional vote shares. Interestingly, the difference in the impact on unconditional vote shares between negative advertising by the candidate and that by PACs is even larger. A 1% increase in negative advertising by the candidate produces a significant 0.015% lift in the candidate's unconditional vote shares. By contrast, negative advertising from PACs is ineffective in increasing its supported candidate's unconditional vote shares. Given the rise in third-party spending over the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goldstein et al. 2011)</ref>, this is a salient set of findings. Our conjecture is that this pattern of results is due to differences in source credibility across the various ad sponsors and that advertising by PACs may lack credibility.</p><p>We further explore whether this pattern holds when races are competitive. We find that the effectiveness of negative political advertising by PACs is moderated by race competitiveness. When a race is less competitive, negative advertising by PACs produces a significant positive lift in two-party vote shares. However, when the race is competitive, negative advertising by PACs is ineffective in shifting two-party vote share. The results imply that the influence of advertising by PACs may be limited in competitive senatorial races.</p><p>In terms of methodology, we add to a growing body of literature that uses "border strategy" approaches that rely on discontinuities in advertising rates across historically determined TV markets to infer the effectiveness of advertising. Border-based strategies have become increasingly common in marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shapiro 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Tuchman 2017</ref>, as they alleviate some concerns about the endogenous nature of advertising expenditures. Our political advertising context is especially useful for demonstrating the border discontinuity approach because the analysis yields fresh insights to an established literature. The political context also helps highlight several of the limitations inherent in the approach such as issues related to generalizability. As the number of applications of the technique grows, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the method. We conclude the paper with a discussion focused on limitations of what a border strategy allows us to identify and determine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Political advertising is a topic of great interest to multiple academic disciplines and the general public. Political campaigns have largely come to resemble marketing campaigns, and the levels of spending observed in the marketplace suggest that advertising has a significant effect on electoral outcomes. Given the perceived importance of money in influencing campaign outcomes, there is significant interest in understanding and regulating political advertising. For example, one area of concern is the increasing amount of third-party advertising. Super PACs or "independent-expenditure only committees" are a relatively recent type of organization that is prohibited from coordinating directly with campaigns. Super PACs are also allowed to raise funds without any limit on contribution size. This lack of spending limits has raised new concerns about the role of money in political campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Marcus 2012)</ref>. In this section, we consider literature related to the study of political advertising effects, negative advertising, and source credibility. The purpose of the section is to develop a set of research questions related to the effects of advertising tone and source on vote shares and turnout rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Political Advertising</head><p>There is an extensive literature focused on political advertising effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lau et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lau et al. , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Franz and Ridout 2007)</ref>. In terms of the most fundamental question of whether political advertising matters, the literature has yielded mixed results (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Jacobson 1978, Gelman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">King 1993)</ref>. This literature is concentrated in political science journals, but there is a growing interest in the marketing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Klein and Ahluwalia 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Lovett and Shachar 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Gordon and Hartmann 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Chung and Zhang 2016</ref>.</p><p>The mixed results found in the literature are likely due to the challenges inherent to studying advertising effectiveness in the context of politics. On one hand, elections offer an attractive context for studying advertising effectiveness because contests are short-term and finite in nature. However, there are also significant concerns about advertising levels being endogenous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gordon et al. (2012)</ref> provide an extensive discussion of issues related to endogeneity issues in political advertising. The key point is that there are many unobservable factors that enter the decision processes of candidates, parties, and PACs. Prior research has used cost shifters such as the prior year's advertising price <ref type="bibr">Hartmann 2013, Chung and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Zhang 2016)</ref> as political advertising instruments.</p><p>An alternative approach to controlling for the possibility of endogenous advertising levels can be found in the border strategy approach that has been used to study advertising effectiveness for e-cigarettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Tuchman 2017</ref>) and antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shapiro 2018</ref>).</p><p>The use of geographically targeted advertising in political campaigns provides a natural experiment setting to study the effectiveness of political advertising. A discontinuity-based natural experiment reduces concerns about endogeneity, while the closed-ended nature of political campaigns reduces concerns about making assumptions about decay rates. One purpose of our study is to exploit the DMA-based advertising discontinuity and thus add insights to the literature on political advertising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Negative Advertising</head><p>In addition to the question of overall spending effects, there is still considerable debate about the effectiveness of negative advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ansolabehere and Iyengar 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Sorescu and Gelb 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Lau et al. 2007</ref>). Negative advertising has flourished since the 1960s, and its popularity is often attributed to the increased role of television in political campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lau et al. 1999)</ref>. A common motivation for studying negative advertising is that, while surveys suggest that voters dislike negative advertising, candidates tend to use negative advertising extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lau et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>An additional complication in analyzing the relative efficacy of positive and negative advertising is related to the decision of when campaigns should engage in negative advertising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goldstein and Freedman (2002)</ref> report that a higher proportion of advertisements are negative in close races. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lovett and Shachar (2011)</ref> use data on elections for the U.S. House of Representatives from 2000 to 2004 to study advertising tone. They find that negative advertising can increase both the voters' knowledge and the advertising budget of campaigns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lau et al. (2007)</ref> note that the conventional wisdom among political consultants and candidates is that negative advertising is more effective than positive advertising in its ability to influence voter preferences. The notion that negative advertising will have greater efficacy is often based on some form of negativity bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rozin and Royzman 2001)</ref>. Negativity bias refers to the idea that negative information and events have a greater impact than neutral or positive information. While negative advertising has been theorized to be a more effective tool for changing attitudes, the metaanalyses on the effects of negative advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lau et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lau et al. , 2007</ref> have failed to support the premise that negative advertising is an effective means of increasing vote shares.</p><p>However, there may also be consequences to "going negative." For instance, there may be a concern that the act of going negative might create unfavorable associations with the sponsoring candidate's brand. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Merritt (1984)</ref> finds that negative advertising harms the perceptions of both the sponsoring and targeted candidate. Given the increased prominence of third-party advertising (i.e., by PACs and super PACs) in recent years, it is an open question as to <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 333-355, Â© 2018</ref> whether candidates themselves should engage in negative advertising or if they can leave it to third-party groups to "do their dirty work."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Source Credibility and Branding</head><p>The political science field has begun to pay significant attention to third-party advertising from PACs and super PACs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pfau et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Fowler and Ridout 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Painter 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Franz et al. 2016</ref>. Much of this literature is guided by theories of source credibility. One prominent theory is that candidate advertising is discounted because of the obvious self-interest of the candidate. By contrast, third-party ads from PACs may be given more credence because they have neutralsounding names. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weber et al. (2012)</ref> test advertisement effectiveness in a lab setting by varying whether an advertisement is sponsored by a candidate, known interest group, or unknown interest group. They find that ads sponsored by unknown groups are more effective than advertisements from known groups and candidates. They also find that persuasion is moderated by the perceived credibility of the source.</p><p>However, the assumptions about the relative source credibility of candidates and third-party advertisers may be incomplete in that they fail to consider important marketing issues. Source credibility might also be considered through the lens of signaling theory or brand equity. The fields of information economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Stigler 1961</ref>) and signaling theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Stightz 1987)</ref> are concerned with how firms can send signals to inform consumers credibly. For example, investment in a brand name can represent a commitment to high quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Milgrom and Roberts 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Swait 1998, 2004)</ref>. The basic notion is that investments in advertising and other marketing communications are at risk if the firm delivers a low-quality product.</p><p>In the realm of political advertising, the "sources" of ads differ in terms of the brand equity at risk. While super PACs may have unbiased-sounding names, these names are likely unknown to the vast majority of voters. There is also some evidence that third-party advertising includes a significant number of deceptive claims. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Winneg et al. (2014)</ref> report that more than a fifth of ads from super PACs include misleading or false claims. This finding indicates a potential issue in terms of super PAC effectiveness if voters form broad opinions about the credibility of super PACs.</p><p>In contrast to super PACs that enable donors to remain unknown, often until the election has concluded, individual politicians and parties likely have goals related to building credibility to achieve longterm goals. In the case of individual candidates, this may relate to reelection or aspirations for higher office. In other words, politicians are brands (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thomson 2006, Hoegg and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lewis 2011)</ref> whose brand equity develops over a series of elections. Given the desire of most politicians to have careers that extend across multiple terms, this creates a potential risk to engaging in noncredible negative advertising, as negative perceptions of the candidate may persist from one election to the next. By contrast, super PACs often operate in a single cycle.</p><p>The preceding arguments suggest that candidates and parties are "brands" with equity and credibility, while third-party advertisers are less credible. If this conjecture is true, then advertising supported by candidates and parties will be more effective than that of PACs and super PACs. Alternatively, the neutralsounding names of the super PACs coupled with the self-interest of the candidates might suggest the opposite effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Negativity Biases and Source Credibility</head><p>Given the preceding discussion, a natural extension to prior research is to question whether the source of advertising will influence the reaction to advertising tone. Some work in psychology suggests a possible interaction between source credibility and ad tone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tormala et al. (2006)</ref> study the interaction of message tone and source credibility and identify a situation where high credibility may result in lower persuasion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tormala et al. (2006)</ref> find that persuasion is greater "when people generate primarily positive thoughts" (p. 684) and then learn that the source is highly credible. It is also possible that high credibility interacts with a negative tone by buffering backlash from the negativity, thereby making it more effective. It should be noted that this body of research has typically considered situations involving high elaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Summary</head><p>Our review of the literature suggests that there are open questions related to how advertising source and tone affect vote shares and turnout rates. To our knowledge, our research is among the first to jointly consider the effects of ad tone and source in a political setting. Our most important research question relates to the interplay between advertising source and advertising tone. This is a salient question given the lack of restrictions on super PAC donations and the prevalence of negative advertising in the political realm. If different "sources" have different credibility levels, then we might expect that negative advertising might differ in effectiveness across sponsors. If this is true, then candidates may wish to alter their decisions regarding tone and donors may wish to fund different types of entities.</p><p>We address these issues in stages with a set of nested research questions. Our first research question is the broad question of whether an advantage in advertising spending alters voting patterns. Our second research question examines whether negative advertising is more effective than positive advertising.</p><p>Our third and ultimate research question is about the potential interactive effect of ad sponsorship and tone on voter behavior. Specifically, we examine whether there is an asymmetric advertising effect depending on whether the sponsor is the candidate or a thirdparty and whether the efficacy of negative advertising is moderated by the source of the message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical Border Strategy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Setup of Natural Experiment-Based</head><p>Border Strategy Our empirical strategy involves using advertising discontinuities along the borders of DMAs to assess advertising effectiveness. Fundamentally, we are interested in comparing vote shares and turnouts of counties that are very near to each other geographically but exposed to different levels of political advertising as a result of the way the television market borders are constructed. These artificial breaks in advertising levels create a natural experiment from which we draw causal inferences about the effects of political advertising on vote shares and turnouts.</p><p>The exploitation of variation across borders has been used previously to study advertising effectiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huber and Arceneaux (2007)</ref> exploit an "accidental" treatment along state borders, where presidential ads spill over into non-battleground states that are adjacent to a battleground state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krasno and Green (2008)</ref> also leverage a border strategy to study turnout in the 2000 presidential election. In neither of these studies did the authors consider the influence of ad source on the effectiveness of political advertising.</p><p>Designated media markets are particularly relevant to political advertising campaigns, as the sale of local advertising to senatorial candidates, parties, and PACs is at the DMA level. The key factor that facilitates our analysis is that DMA borders are exogenous to political elections and voter characteristics. A DMA is a collection of counties based around a large city. It is designed by Nielsen to put together counties that pick up the same local station over the air. As an example of a DMA border, the border of the Atlanta and Macon DMAs, is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Counties including Upson, Lamar, Butts, Jasper, Putnam, and Greene are in the pink-colored Atlanta DMA. These counties share borders with counties such as Crawford, Monroe, Jones, Baldwin, and Hancock in the orange-colored Macon DMA. In the 2010 senatorial election, there were a total of 6,052 GRPs in the Atlanta DMA versus a total of 6,606 GRPs in the Macon DMA.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">2 and 3</ref> provide a visual image of the geographic structure of the DMA border counties. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the 2,819 counties relevant to the 47 senatorial elections in 2010 and 2012 located in 210 DMAs. 2 Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the 1,325 counties located along the 325 within-state DMA borders relevant for our analysis of the 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. As a point of comparison, there are a total 3,144 counties in the United States.</p><p>On average, border counties account for about 6% of DMA populations. An important assumption in our work is that DMA-targeted advertising is based on aggregate market-level conditions across the entire DMA rather than on specific factors present in border counties. This assumption is salient, as differences in advertising exposures across DMA borders should not be correlated with observed or unobserved voter characteristics along the borders of DMAs.</p><p>Each DMA border is treated as a natural experiment based on the variation in political advertising intensity on the two sides of the border. Counties that lie on the border serve as controls for each other to condition out local border effects. As there can be different numbers of counties on the two sides of DMA borders, each treatment may have a different number of "county" subjects. Given the two rounds of senatorial elections in 2010 and 2012, we conduct the analysis at the DMAborder-county-year level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Difference-in-Difference Approach</head><p>We apply a modified difference-in-difference approach to estimate the effects of political advertising tone and source on two-party vote shares and turnout rates. In our empirical analysis, we focus on the states in which two senatorial elections occurred <ref type="bibr">(in 2010 and 2012)</ref>. In terms of notation, we use b to denote border, m to denote DMA, c to denote county, and t to denote year. The difference-in-difference specification is then given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log VS R, bmct VS D, bmct Î± 1 log 1 + CanN Rmt 1 + CanN Dmt + Î± 2 log 1 + PacN Rmt 1 + PacN Dmt + Î± 3 log 1 + CanP Rmt 1 + CanP Dmt + Î± 4 log 1 + PacP Rmt 1 + PacP Dmt + Îµ bmct , (1) log TO bmct 1 â TO bmct Î² 1 log(1 + CanN Tmt ) + Î² 2 log(1 + PacN Tmt ) + Î² 3 log(1 + CanP Tmt ) + Î² 4 log(1 + PacP Tmt ) + Ï bmct ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the terms VS R, bmct and VS D, bmct are two-party vote shares for Republican and Democratic candidates conditional on turnout in county c in year t, respectively. The term TO bmct is the turnout rate in county c in year t. The endogenous nature of advertising leads to a concern that the advertising terms are correlated with unobservable factors that enter candidates' and PACs' decision processes. Thus, we break the error terms into Îµ bmct c + b + t + bt + cb + ct + cbt . Note that we exclude market unobservables because these are subsumed in the other unobservables. For example, the county fixed effects will capture the market fixed effects, and market-border effects are captured in the border effects. To deal with the unobservables, we include fixed effects and rewrite Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log VS R, bmct VS D, bmct Î± c + Î± b + Î± t + Î± bt + Î± 1 log 1 + CanN R, mt 1 + CanN D, mt + Î± 2 log 1 + PacN R, mt 1 + PacN D, mt + Î± 3 log 1 + CanP R, mt 1 + CanP D, mt + Î± 4 log 1 + PacP R, mt 1 + PacP D, mt + Îµ bc + Îµ ct + Îµ bct ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">log TO bmct 1 â TO bmct Î² c + Î² b + Î² t + Î² bt + Î² 1 log(1 + CanN T, mt ) + Î² 2 log(1 + PacN T, mt ) + Î² 3 log(1 + CanP T, mt ) + Î² 4 log(1 + PacP T, mt ) + Ï bc + Ï ct + Ï bct.</formula><p>(4)</p><p>Here, Î± c and Î² c are county fixed effects to control for time-invariant systematic differences across treatments. As long as county unique fixed effects are included, systematic differences in county vote shares, turnout, and advertising GRPs are absorbed. For example, the fact that Pike County in Pennsylvania has a higher vote share for Republicans in both 2010 and 2012 and that King County in Washington has a lower vote share for Republicans in both 2010 and 2012 is not However, temporal variation in unobservable variables is not captured in county or border fixed effects. Thus, we include border-year fixed effects Î± bt and Î² bt to control for temporal trends that are common to all counties along a border. Put another way, these are temporal trends that are common to a pair of markets on the two sides of market borders. It is likely that part of the temporal trends in two-party vote shares, for example, could be due to temporal variations in advertising GRPs. Yet it is also possible that the temporal trends in vote shares come from changes in local demographics, economic conditions, or simply candidates' attractiveness, which could be correlated with advertising GRPs. The common temporal trends Î± bt and Î² bt pick up temporal changes in local demographics, economic conditions, or simply candidates' attractiveness, which could be correlated with advertising GRPs.</p><p>The sets of county fixed effects and year-border fixed effects set the basis for the identification strategy in our border-experiment setting. We now turn to the remaining unobservables, Îµ bc , Îµ ct , Îµ bct , Ï bc , Ï ct , and Ï bct in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). The term Îµ bc includes the unobservable factors associated with county c on a media market border b. As mentioned before, DMA borders are exogenous to political elections and voter characteristics. The media border was designed by Nielsen to place together counties that pick up the same local station over the air. Thus, they are uncorrelated with advertising ratings.</p><p>The term Îµ ct represents county c's deviation from the common temporal trends Î± bt shared by all the counties along a border. As we focus on the neighboring counties on the two sides of DMA borders, the unobserved local changes including demographics, economic conditions, and weather conditions that may affect advertising GRPs and voting outcomes should not be significantly different between one part of a DMA border and the other. For example, weather patterns are continuous and similar along DMA borders. As long as the time-varying unobservables do not discontinuously change at the border, our assumption that counties along the same border share a common temporal trend is reasonable.</p><p>The last term, Îµ bct , represents random shocks. We denote a new error term, Îµ bct Îµ bc + Îµ ct + Îµ bct , to capture the three unobservables. The same idea applies in Equation (4) for the unobservables Ï cb , Ï ct , and Ï cbt . Therefore, the equations for empirical estimation are written in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Î± c + Î± b + Î± t + Î± bt + Î± 1 log 1 + CanN R, mt 1 + CanN D, mt + Î± 2 log 1 + PacN R, mt 1 + PacN D, mt + Î± 3 log 1 + CanP R, mt 1 + CanP D, mt + Î± 4 log 1 + PacP R, mt 1 + PacP D, mt + Îµ bct ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">log TO bmct 1 â TO bmct Î² c + Î² b + Î² t + Î² bt + Î² 1 log(1 + CanN T, mt ) + Î² 2 log(1 + PacN T, mt ) + Î² 3 log(1 + CanP T, mt ) + Î² 4 log(1 + PacP T, mt ) + Ï bct .

However, this is not the case in the difference-in-difference approach because of the assumptions that the unobservables are removed using the differencing by county and border-year unique fixed effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data</head><p>Data on 2010 and 2012 senatorial advertising were obtained from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Advertising Group (CMAG), a commercial firm that tracks political advertising (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Goldstein and Freedman 2002)</ref>. For the 2010 and 2012 electoral cycles, the 210 largest media markets were tracked by Kantar. The data were collected at the level of individual ad airings and include sponsor, day and time, media market, and estimated cost.</p><p>In addition to tracking aired ads, CMAG staff also code each ad. The staff first research the entity responsible for airing each spot, distinguishing between those paid for by candidates, parties, and PACs. Next, CMAG codes the content of each ad on an extensive list of questions using a web-based content analysis platform called AcademiClip. Examples of the questions include, "Is the primary purpose of the ad to promote a specific candidate, attack a candidate, or contrast the candidates?," "If the ad is a contrast ad, what proportion of the ad promotes (as opposed to attacks) a candidate?," and "If the ad is a contrast ad, does it finish by promoting a candidate or attacking a candidate?" Thus, CMAG creates a storyboard for every ad copy and systematically codes ads as either supporting or attacking a candidate.</p><p>To measure advertising intensity, there are three alternative approaches including advertising frequency, advertising spending, and gross rating points. Advertising frequency only accounts for the total number of ads but does not take into account the different reach achieved based on factors such as time of a day. Advertising spending has some positive properties but is problematic for our purposes, given that advertising costs may differ considerably across media markets. We use gross rating points as our measure of advertising exposure.</p><p>To capture the total gross rating points of political advertising, we obtained GRPs of each airing of an advertisement from the Kantar Media Strategy database. We average the GRPs over half-hour intervals on weekdays and weekends in each DMA, and we match the 30-minute ratings to the corresponding political advertisements in that interval in the CMAG data set. Put another way, the rating is matched at the halfhour-week position-market level. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>(a) shows two peaks in GRP ratings within a day. It also shows that GRP ratings are higher on weekdays.</p><p>Given the focus of our research, we aggregated the GRPs of all the political advertisements aired between September 1 and the day of the election by ad tone and source. There are four levels of GRPs, including negative GRPs by candidates and parties, negative GRPs by PACs, positive GRPs by candidates and parties, and positive GRPs by PACs. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4(b</ref>) and 4(c), we  show that ads with different tones and sources are distributed in a similar pattern across day-parts. We also obtained county-level votes for each senatorial candidate in 2010 and 2012 from NYtimes.com and demographic information including socioeconomic variables and voting age population of citizens aged 18 and older from the 2010 U.S. census data.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> presents summary statistics of advertising ratings in DMAs in the 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. Over the two election cycles, political advertising intensified. In 2010, an average voter watched 78 ads during the approximately two-month period preceding the election, while in 2012, the average voter watched 94 ads in the two-month period. The negative to positive advertising ratio stayed constant at a rate of approximately 3:1. An interesting development is that the amount of political advertising sponsored by PACs has increased over time. The political advertising GRPs sponsored by PACs increased from 14% in 2010 to 23% in 2012.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>   are calculated as the number of votes for a candidate divided by the total number of votes received for the two candidates. Turnout rates are calculated as the total number of votes in a county divided by the voting age population minus ineligible felons. We include three  border counties and the complete set of counties. There is greater variation in the electoral outcomes across the complete set of counties. A noticeable difference is that an average border county has a smaller population compared with an average county (60,591 versus 92,947). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> further compares independent samples of counties on the border versus those not on the border. Border counties tend to have lower median incomes and fewer blacks and Hispanics. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref> compares the border county and the center county that reside in the same DMA. We find similar patterns in demographic differences between border and center counties. This is an important issue in a border strategy analysis, as border counties may not be representative of counties in general. To potentially alleviate concerns about differences between border counties and those closer to the center of the DMA, we conduct a robustness check that includes the distance from the DMA center as a potential moderator.</p><p>Another assumption of the border strategy approach is that counties along the DMA borders are comparable in observed and unobserved characteristics. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref> provides evidence that there are no significant differences between counties that lie on the two sides of DMA borders in observed socioeconomic characteristics including voting age population, median household (HH) income, unemployment rate, college graduation, partisan voting index, and so on.</p><p>The border strategy approach specified in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) largely relies on the exploration of temporal variation differences in two-party vote shares and turnouts of the neighboring counties based on variation differences in advertising GRPs on the two sides of DMA borders over time. For example, if the Macon DMA always had a high level of advertising GRPs compared with the Atlanta DMA, the border strategy would not be able to identify the treatment effects of advertising GRPs on outcomes of interest.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>(a) we show the degree of advertising variation over time on one side of DMA border versus the other. There is sufficient variation in GRP exposure over time even after subtracting county fixed effects. For example, the political advertising GRPs in Columbus, Ohio, increased sharply from 101 ads in 2010 to 375 ads in 2012, while in Seattle, Washington, GRPs dropped from 324 ads in 2010 to 18 ads in 2012.</p><p>The chart in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>(b) illustrates that the advertising variation over time differs considerately on the one side of the DMA border versus the other. Specifically, the dots do not exactly lie on a 45Â°line where the  two sides increased or decreased the same amount of advertising over time. The differences in the temporal variation in advertising GRPs on the two sides of DMA borders along with exogenous border lines and comparable neighboring counties sets up the identification basis of our border strategy.   while bubbles are proportional to the state's voting age population. The states with a larger margin of victory are exposed to a lower level of advertising. However, we have a large fraction of states with less than a 10% margin of victory in the 2010 and 2012 senatorial races.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Preliminary Evidence</head><p>We next provide evidence to illustrate how political advertising tone and source influence electoral outcomes. We estimate the models with the county fixed effects and year-border fixed effects in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) but exclude the advertising variables. We also regress each of the advertising terms in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and (6) on the same set of county fixed effects and year-border fixed effects. This allows us to control for the unobservable variation across border counties and the common temporal trends between the neighboring border counties in two-party vote shares, turnouts, and different types of advertising ratings. Next, we plot the residuals from two-party vote share and turnout regressions against that from the four types of advertising based on the tone and source. Each dot is a border county. The variation left from the fixed effects is what helps identify the advertising coefficients in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>).</p><p>In the top left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>, we observe a positive relationship between negative GRPs sponsored by candidates and parties (or PACs) and two-party vote shares.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results</head><p>We estimate Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>) together as seemingly unrelated equations. Given that border counties in the same DMA are exposed to the same advertising levels, we cluster the standard errors at the DMA market level. In the appendix, we provide estimation steps for clustered standard errors. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">6</ref>, we estimate four versions of the model by including different sets of dummy variables. Column (1) includes only county unique fixed effects. Column (2) includes both county unique fixed effects and local demographics interacted with year dummies. This specification attempts to account for temporal variation across counties with demographic variables. Column (3) partially controls for unobserved local temporal variation by including state unique year dummies. Column (4) fully controls for the unobserved local variation over time by including border unique year dummies. The additional border unique year dummies significantly reduce the advertising coefficient in both two-party vote share and turnout equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Political Advertising Effectiveness by</head><p>Tone and Source We start with the question of whether undifferentiated political advertising affects two-party vote share and turnout. We begin by not differentiating between ads based on tone or source, thereby estimating a model that is nested by the full specification presented in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>). The results in column (4) of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">6</ref> show that political advertising has no significant impact on two-party vote share and is ineffective in mobilizing voter turnout. Given the level of spending in political campaign years, such a finding   warrants the attention of both campaign managers and regulators.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">7</ref>, we present a model that distinguishes between positive and negative tones. Note that we include border unique year dummies in all the remaining analyses. The results show that negative political advertising has a significant positive effect on twoparty vote shares, while positive political advertising does not affect two-party vote shares. These results are consistent with a negativity bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Skowronski and Carlston 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Baumeister et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Rozin and Royzman 2001</ref> and explain the prevalence of negative political advertising. When it comes to turnout, neither negative nor positive political advertising is effective in mobilizing turnout. We further assess the differences in ad effectiveness by interacting the two types of sources (candidates and parties versus PACs) with the two types of tones (positive versus negative). This is the full model specification presented in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>). The results, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>, show that the negative advertising sponsored by candidates and that sponsored by PACs are both effective in increasing two-party vote shares. The difference is that the negative advertising sponsored by PACs is significantly less effective than that sponsored by the candidate or party in affecting two-party vote shares (0.013 versus 0.025). The same directional pattern holds for voter turnout: negative advertising by the candidate or party is significantly effective in mobilizing turnouts, while negative advertising by PACs is ineffective in terms of turnout.</p><p>Our empirical findings are consistent with the preliminary evidence provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. Why is the negative advertising by PACs less effective than that by candidates and parties? It is possible that voters respond differently to advertisements from candidates and third-party groups as a result of concerns with the credibility of the ads. One potential explanation for our findings is that advertisers have different degrees of brand equity at risk. While PACs may go to market with unbiased-sounding names, these names are likely new to the vast majority of voters.</p><p>The source credibility theory also applies to the positive advertising domain. We find that positive advertising by candidate or party has a negative impact on two-party vote shares, while positive advertising by PACs has no effects on two-party vote shares. The results suggest that positive advertising by candidates and parties leads to backlash because of the obvious self-interest, while positive advertising by PACs has no  Notes. To interpret the results, for example, a 1% increase in a Democrat's candidate and party-sponsored negative advertising exposure (GRPs) increases his vote shares by 0.0150%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Political Advertising Elasticity by Tone and Source</head><p>The estimated correlation between the equations for two-party vote share and turnout is significantly negative (â0.18), suggesting that a higher turnout increased Democratic candidates' two-party vote shares in the 2010 and 2012 elections. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref>, we take into account the correlation between the two-party vote shares and turnouts, and we calculate advertising elasticity of two-party vote shares, unconditional vote shares, and turnouts through simulation.</p><p>We find that a 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs will increase the Republican's two-party vote share by 0.007% and reduce the Democrat's two-party vote share by 0.009%. A 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs also leads to a 0.007% increase in turnout. When combining the changes in turnout and conditional vote shares, we find that a 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs will increase the Republican's unconditional vote share by 0.013%. Interestingly, it does not hurt the unconditional vote shares of Democrats. This is due to the positive correlation between turnout and Democrats' vote share.</p><p>Similarly, a 1% increase in a Democratic candidate's negative advertising GRPs yields a 0.009% increase in the Democrat's two-party vote share and reduces the Republican's two-party vote share by 0.007%. Taking into account the 0.006% increase in turnouts, the expected increase in the Democratic candidate's unconditional vote share is 0.015%.</p><p>We next consider the elasticity of negative advertising by PACs and super PACs. We find that a 1% increase in the negative advertising GRPs by Republican PACs increases a Republican's two-party vote shares by 0.004% and reduces the Democrat's two-party vote shares by 0.005%. However, the two-party vote share changes do not translate into a significant change in the unconditional vote shares. This is due to the positive correlation between turnout and voting preference for the Democrats. We find similar patterns for the elasticity of negative advertising GRPs from Democratic PACs.</p><p>The empirical results suggest that negative advertising from candidates and parties is approximately twice as effective as negative advertising from super PACs when we consider two-party vote shares as the performance metric. The difference is larger when it comes to unconditional vote shares. Negative advertising by PACs is ineffective in affecting its supported candidate's unconditional vote shares, while negative advertising by candidate or party has a significant elasticity of approximately 0.015 on a candidate's unconditional vote share.</p><p>In terms of positive advertising, our analysis shows that a 1% increase in positive advertising GRPs by candidate or party produces an approximately 0.005% reduction in the two-party vote share of the candidate and about a 0.009% reduction in unconditional vote share.</p><p>We further report the estimated effect of political advertising using persuasion rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kaplan 2007, DellaVigna and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gentzkow 2010)</ref>. The persuasion rate was originally developed in a setting with a binary behavioral outcome (e.g., vote for a candidate), a treatment group that receives a message, and a control group that does not. It measures the percentage of <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 333-355, Â© 2018</ref> receivers who are not already persuaded but change behavior after receiving a message. We find that the persuasion rates of one additional gross rating point on the partisan vote share difference in the senatorial races under study range from 0.01% to 0.74%. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Moderators of Race Competitiveness when</head><p>Tone and Source Matters We have shown that candidates' and parties' negative advertising is more effective than PACs' negative advertising. We next explore whether this pattern holds when races are competitive. Whether negative advertising by PACs has a larger effect in competitive races provides a deeper understanding of the impact of PACs' advertising and could provide PACs with insight into managing their investments in different races.</p><p>To conduct this analysis we use a partisan voting index to indicate race competitiveness. The Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) measures how strongly a congressional district leans Democratic or Republican, compared to the nation as a whole. It is calculated by comparing the district's average Democratic or Republican Party's share of the two-party presidential vote in the past two presidential elections to the nation's average share of the same. The national average for 2004 and 2008 was 51.2% Democratic to 48.8% Republican. Thus, a PVI being zero means that it is an almost even and extremely competitive race, while a large absolute value of the PVI implies that a region leans heavily toward one party. We collected the partisan voting index from the Cook Political Report and matched each county to a congressional district. We split the absolute value of county PVI scores by its median and categorize counties with scores below the median as competitive. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">10</ref> reports estimation results with heterogeneous effects for ad tone and source by race competitiveness. We find that the effectiveness of negative political advertising by PACs is moderated by race competitiveness. When the race is less competitive, negative advertising by PACs produces a significant positive lift in two-party vote shares. However, when the race is competitive, negative advertising by PACs is ineffective in shifting two-party vote shares. In contrast to advertising by PACs, we do not find that the competitiveness of the race moderates the effectiveness of advertising by candidates, providing additional support for the notion that consumers process advertisements differently based on their source. Our results suggest that negative advertising from PACs and super PACs plays a limited role in competitive senatorial races. This finding deserves attention from major donors, PACs, super PACs, campaign managers, and regulators.</p><p>A possible explanation for the findings related to competitive races may be found in dual process theories such as the elaboration likelihood mode (ELM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Petty et al. 1983)</ref>. The ELM may be relevant to the preceding result if we assume that race competitiveness somehow equates to greater involvement. Perhaps heightened media attention results in a more informed and engaged electorate and therefore a greater likelihood that voters utilize more detailed, central route processing. Research in marketing has found that negative and comparative advertising results in greater counterarguing and "boomerang" effects <ref type="bibr">(Belch 1981, James and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hensel 1991)</ref>. However, it should be noted that this is theoretical conjecture that rests on the notion that greater race competitiveness results in more involved voters.</p><p>We also conducted additional analyses focused on possible asymmetries in advertising effects based on demographics factors. Specifically, we tested possible interactions between socioeconomic factors and ad characteristics. These tests were motivated largely by themes expressed in the popular media. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Graham (2016)</ref> suggests that negative advertising has been used as a tool for suppressing minority voting. This suggests a need to test an interaction between minority populations and negative advertising rates. We also tested an interaction between educational levels and advertising source based on the logic that higher educational levels might result in a more engaged or elaborative voting population. Neither line of testing yielded significant results. In other words, we do not find evidence that ad source or ad tone operate differently based on demographics. These null findings provide further support for the use of the border strategy. While border counties tend to be demographically different from DMA centers, these preliminary tests suggest that our key findings are not driven by demographic differences.</p><p>These null findings regarding interactions between advertising characteristics and socioeconomics provide a robustness check, as it does not appear that these demographic differences produce asymmetric advertising effects. As shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3 and 4</ref>, border counties tend to have a lower median income, smaller black and Hispanic populations, and lower populations. The lack of systematic differences in response based on demographics provides support for the generalizability of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Additional Robustness Checks</head><p>We also conducted a robustness check related to population level. Given that border counties are less populous, they are less likely to affect campaign advertising decisions. This may mitigate some concerns about endogeneity. However, the smaller populations may raise a concern that the counties under examination are more "rural" than average. To investigate whether more rural areas respond differently to advertising, we operationalize "ruralness" based on the driving distance between the county and the center of DMA market. We then investigated whether advertising effectiveness varies by the distance between the border county and the center of DMA market. We labeled counties as rural using a median split (60 miles). Online Appendix 1 reports estimation results based on ad tone, source, and distance between border county and DMA center. We find no significant interactions between driving distance and ad tone or source. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We obtained similar results when using aerial distance instead of driving distance. The results suggest that advertising effectiveness does not vary between rural and metro areas in senatorial elections.</p><p>We also compared a multinomial logit specification to our joint specification of two-party vote shares and turnout rates. In Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">6</ref>), we allow the error terms of the two-party vote share and turnout equations to be correlated. Alternatively, a multinomial logit specification with each voter choosing among three options of Republican, Democratic, and not voting could be formulated. In Online Appendix 2, we report advertising coefficients by tone and source in a multinomial logit specification. Note that we include exactly the same set of county and border-year unique fixed effects as those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">8</ref>. We also cluster the standard errors at the DMA market level. The results show that only the negative ads by candidate or party produce a significant effect on vote shares.</p><p>In Online Appendix 3, we calculate the elasticity of two-party vote shares, unconditional vote shares, and turnouts through simulation using the logit specification. For example, a 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs will increase a Republican's two-party vote shares by 0.008% and reduce a Democrat's two-party vote shares by 0.011%. The 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs also leads to a 0.006% increase in turnout. Combining the changes in two-party vote shares and turnouts, we find that a 1% increase in a Republican candidate's negative advertising GRPs increases a Republican's unconditional vote shares by 0.014%, and it reduces the unconditional vote shares of Democrats by 0.005%.</p><p>Three things are worth noting when comparing the elasticities reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref> and Online Appendix 3. First, advertising elasticities from the two specifications are similar in magnitude. The elasticity of negative advertising by candidate or party on unconditional vote shares is approximately 0.015. Second, the cross elasticity on opponent's unconditional vote share is insignificant in our joint specification but significant in the multinomial logit specification. This is because our joint model of two-party vote shares and turnouts is better at accommodating the potential correlation between turnout and voting preference. When the Republican candidate increases negative GRPs by 1%, there is a 0.006% increase in <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 333-355, Â© 2018</ref> voter turnout. Correspondingly, the increase in voter turnout increases the competitiveness of the Democratic candidate. This link is not available in the multinomial logit specification. Third, our joint specification allows political advertising to affect two-party vote shares and turnouts differently. For example, the joint specification shows that negative GRPs by PACs have a significant effect on two-party vote shares but are ineffective in mobilizing voters. By contrast, the multinomial logit specification suggests a conclusion that negative GRPs by PACs have no significant effect in either vote share or turnout.</p><p>We also performed a robustness check using data from a different political context. Specifically, we performed a similar difference-in-difference border-strategy analysis using data from presidential elections. In Online Appendix 4, we present summary statistics for advertising in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. Two patterns are worth noting. First, the 2012 presidential election featured significantly more negativity. The negative to positive advertising GRP ratio increased from approximately 2:1 to 9:1. Second, the proportion of advertising sponsored by PACs increased from 4% to 15% for the Republican presidential candidates, while the proportion of advertising sponsored by PACs remained at a low level for the Democratic presidential candidate (about 3%-6%).</p><p>An important issue in the presidential context is that the Electoral College system leads to a high concentration of advertising in more competitive or "swing" states. Online Appendices 5 and 6 show the relationship between ad source, ad tone, and popular vote margins. In states such as Washington, New York, and California, there is minimal advertising spending. Therefore, in a border strategy analysis, we are left with limited data points mostly from "swing" states such as Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p><p>Online Appendix 7 presents results from a model that includes advertising source and tone for presidential elections. The presidential results are consistent but less significant relative to the senatorial results. We again find a significant effect for negative advertising GRPs sponsored by candidates and parties. However, negative advertising GRPs sponsored by PACs are ineffective. This is consistent with our key takeaway that negative advertising sponsored by candidates and parties is more effective than that sponsored by PACs. However, the "marginally significant" results related to the positive spending by candidates are no longer significant.</p><p>The differences in the results between senatorial and presidential elections may be due to systematic differences between the two contexts. As noted, the Electoral College system may introduce additional complications. For example, the focus on swing states may result in a set of nonrepresentative counties. This might occur because swing state residents are subject to more intensely contested elections that feature significant amounts of advertising. Over time, this might fundamentally alter how these counties and states respond to advertising.</p><p>One potential technique to increase the sample size in presidential elections is to use DMA borders that straddle a swing and a non-swing state. However, an implicit assumption of the border strategy approach is that counties on the two sides are similar. DMA borders between swing and non-swing states violate this assumption and thus should not be included to increase sample size. A second potential issue is related to the greater media coverage focused on presidents and presidential campaigns. A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blake 2017)</ref> has suggested that the tone of coverage received by Donald Trump in his first 100 days in office was 80% negative, compared with 41% negative for Barack Obama. The relevant issue is that significant differences in the tone of news coverage might interact with advertising tone decisions made by candidates and PACs. This may lead to systematic differences in how advertising works in senatorial and presidential elections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>In our research, we exploit advertising discontinuities arising from DMA borders to produce findings related to asymmetries in advertising effectiveness in political campaigns. Given the level of spending observed in political campaigns, our findings on the differential effects of political advertising based on source and tone should be of great interest to candidates, campaign managers, donors, and the public.</p><p>Our most notable results are related to the advertising effectiveness of outside organizations such as PACs and super PACs. While the existing political science literature has conjectured that the seeming neutrality of PACs' names will result in greater source credibility and therefore greater advertising effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Weber et al. 2012)</ref>, our empirical results reveal the opposite. Negative advertising by candidates and parties is about twice as effective as PACs' advertising when it comes to two-party vote shares. The difference is larger when we consider unconditional vote shares. This finding is consistent with existing marketing theories related to brand equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Stigler 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr">Swait 1998, 2004)</ref>. While the notion that political candidates are reliable sources is debatable, the key difference between candidates and PACs may be their relative credibility. In addition, we find that super PAC and PAC advertising is even less effective in competitive races. We leave the issue of systematically assessing credibility across candidates, parties, and PACs to future research.</p><p>In terms of limitations, there are issues related to the available data and our approach that should be acknowledged. While our DMA border approach is consistent with previous research on the effectiveness of political advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huber and</ref><ref type="bibr">Arceneaux 2007, Krasno and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Green 2008)</ref> and other marketing contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Shapiro 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Tuchman 2017</ref>, it is important to note limiting issues. A key issue is that any research relying on a border strategy must be mindful of differences between those counties that lie on the border (and are included in the analysis) and those counties that do not. While a comparison of the demographics of border and nonborder counties suggest demographic differences exist, we do not find evidence to suggest that the effects of ad tone and source vary based on the distance from the center of the DMA. Although this provides some assurance as to the robustness of our findings, future research may seek to generalize the border strategy to incorporate data from all counties available, regardless of whether or not they lie on a border.</p><p>In general terms, the existence of advertising discontinuities across adjacent counties provides opportunities to investigate advertising effectiveness. The insight is that the arbitrary nature of the border break points creates an experimental treatment. However, by definition, these analyses focus on the border counties of DMAs rather than the central counties. While the approach allows for a relatively clean analysis of advertising effectiveness in these border counties, it is possible that these border counties are not representative of the general U.S. population. This issue is similar in spirit to the trade-off that occurs between internal and external validity in experimental analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Calder et al. 1982)</ref>. While the border strategy based results speak directly to the behavior in counties that exist along DMA borders, the extendibility of findings from a sample of this "type" of county to the more urban counties at the center of DMAs is an open question for future research.</p><p>Border strategy-based analyses should also acknowledge that issues related to advertising design may potentially influence the interpretation of results. For instance, if advertisers place little emphasis on border counties because these regions are lightly populated or because these residents are not representative of the advertiser's core customer segments, then we might conjecture that these residents are irrelevant and are not explicitly targeted. If this is the case, null findings related to advertising, such as our finding regarding overall expenditures, would be explainable based on an argument that border county residents are not receiving appropriately tailored messages. However, we should note that this is speculation and that we do not have any evidence that voters in border regions are systematically different in terms of response to marketing or that these voters are viewed as irrelevant.</p><p>Another possible criticism of using the border strategy in political advertising contexts is that the long-term consequences of prolonged differences in advertising are difficult to consider. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Because political campaigns are repeated events, it is possible that advertising decisions made in previous cycles have dynamic consequences in terms of shaping the future responsiveness of border districts. Greater absolute advertising levels or different levels of negative advertising might result in long-term effects that change how potential voters respond to advertising. For example, one could imagine a scenario where negative advertising creates disillusioned voters. If this is true, then over time, districts with more negative advertising might become less responsive to political advertising. This type of dynamic scenario suggests opportunities for additional research. If data on advertising tone and source were available for an extended period of time, it might be useful to model the dynamics of decisions related to spending and tone. For instance, if one were to assume that campaigns make advertising expenditures and tone decisions proactively to change voter preferences across cycles, then a researcher could model these decisions using a dynamic game-theoretic model of campaign decisions. We leave this topic to future research.</p><p>Another direction to pursue would be to look into the content of the ads produced by candidates and PACs. For example, we do not consider the possibility that the advertising created by candidates and PACs is fundamentally different. Our classification of advertising as being negative and positive in tone is consistent with tradition and with the available data. It is possible, however, that candidates and PACs utilize different advertising approaches. Candidates may tend to be more or less aggressive in their attacks than PACs. PACs might also tend to attack based on different issues. Candidates might be reluctant to attack based on personal issues for fear about damaging themselves, while a third-party organization might be less concerned. These types of issues could be addressed in future research via content analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .Figure 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

For ease of exposition when discussing empirical findings, we use the term "PAC" to refer to category that includes both PACs and super PACs. 2 Note that we exclude the 2010 senatorial elections in Alaska and Florida from our analysis, as there were three candidates in the race. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We group together GRPs by candidates and parties, as the CMAG data sometimes list the sponsors of an ad as "candidates and party." 4 The estimated persuasion rates are close in magnitude to that reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Spenkuch and Toniatti (2018)</ref>, ranging from 0.01% to 1%. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We also tested a split based on 30 miles.
