<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Customer loyalty programs have become popular across a variety of industries. Two central dimensions of these programs include (1) thresholds that dictate success or failure for reaching reward-contingent goals, and (2) status segments based on levels of previous purchasing. While these dimensions are critical to loyalty program design <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Breugelmans et al. 2015)</ref>, there is little research on the consequences of receiving rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dreze and Nunes 2011)</ref>, the response of loyalty segments to reward programs, and (to our knowledge) no research about failing to receive rewards or the interplay among these factors.</p><p>The current research attempts to fill this gap. We report results of a large scale field experiment con-ducted by a major hotel chain. The experiment systematically varied the thresholds required to earn extra reward points among two test groups and a control group. In addition, the experiment was conducted using members with different loyalty program status levels. Of particular significance, the study design afforded the opportunity to observe these customers in the eight months before the experiment, the eight months of the experiment, and for eight months following the experiment.</p><p>In addition to the direct effect of the promotion, we investigate the enduring impact of reward success and failure. This research question is difficult because reward success and failure are determined not through an experimental manipulation, but based on how consumers respond to the marketing intervention. To 566 Marketing Science 35(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">565-575, © 2016 INFORMS</ref> address this type of selected response we use a combination of propensity scoring analysis and difference-indifferences modeling techniques in addition to control group comparisons to isolate the true impact of the loyalty-based treatments. We supplement this analysis with a panel Tobit model to further control for individual heterogeneity and to investigate the behavioral drivers of the long-term consequences of success and failure.</p><p>We find that failing to earn the promotional reward can significantly degrade customer relationship outcomes as evidenced by a reduction in hotel nights compared to the control group. Analogously, we observe that earning the reward enhances outcomes as indicated by a significant increase in hotel nights compared to the control group. Interestingly, we find that these effects interact with customer loyalty status level such that the most loyal customers ("Platinum") are the least influenced by goal success but are the most influenced by goal failure.</p><p>Our conjecture is that these effects are driven by relationship-specific reciprocity norms; different customer segments (e.g., Platinum, Gold, and Club members) have different reciprocity expectations based on their history with the firm. For example, customers in a high tier relationship have invested heavily in the firm and thus might expect large returns; they therefore can be most affected by goal failure and subsequent denial of rewards. By contrast, customers in a lower tier have invested minimally in the firm and thus might expect few benefits; they therefore can be most affected by goal success and receipt of rewards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background and Hypothesis</head><p>Over the last two decades an academic literature focused on documenting and explaining consumer response to loyalty programs has grown. The early literature questioned the effectiveness of loyalty programs themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dowling and Uncles 1997)</ref>. A second wave of research focused on measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis 2004</ref>) and psychological response to loyalty program design dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kivetz and Simonson 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Kivetz et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Nunes and Dreze 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Roehm et al. 2002</ref>. The literature has begun to consider segment level responses <ref type="bibr">(Liu 2007, Dreze and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Nunes 2009)</ref>. Our research focuses on the effects of successful and unsuccessful goal attainment within a customer loyalty program. This is a challenging area of inquiry for several reasons. First, although archival data provides observations of reward achievement and failure, the lack of a control group unexposed to a reward opportunity means that it is difficult to make inferences about whether a drop or acceleration in buying is due to the reward event or if consumer demand changes are exogenous. Second, even controlled experiments may be inadequate. While it is possible to design experiments that vary loyalty program availability and program dimensions, success or failure is an outcome of how consumers respond to the program rather than a direct result of the experimental manipulation. To address these challenges, we rely on multiple methods including a controlled field experiment <ref type="bibr">(Montaguti et al. 2016, Tucker and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang 2010)</ref> and propensity scoring to isolate consequences of reward attainment and failure.</p><p>Use of field data creates a third challenge. Because the data are collected in the course of a commercial operation, we cannot collect psychological measures. Therefore, to investigate the underlying psychological drivers of response to reward success and failure, we rely on carefully designed econometric specifications.</p><p>Next we discuss several branches of literature that address response to dynamic incentive schemes. Specifically, we consider the consequences of goal success and failure, and how reciprocity expectations or reinforcement learning (or both) may contribute to goal success and failure outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Goals: Success and Failure</head><p>A host of psychological research documents the ability of goals and incentives to motivate effort (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gollwitzer 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Heath et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Locke and Latham 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Jhang and Lynch 2015</ref>. Evidence within the domain of customer loyalty programs is consistent with this literature, finding, for example, that incentivized goals increase consumers' purchase rates and wallet share <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Kivetz et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Taylor and Neslin 2005</ref>.</p><p>Research documenting behavior following goal success or failure is relatively scarce. However, one recent investigation found a positive effect of goal achievement such that goal achievement within ongoing customer loyalty programs allows consumers to learn about their own self-efficacy, thus increasing efforts toward future recurring rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dreze and Nunes 2011)</ref>. Research in marketing and psychology finds generally negative consequences of goal failure. Goal failure can result in subsequent worse performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Soman and Cheema 2004)</ref>; once a goal has been violated, further actions in violation of the goal can follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cochran and Tesser 1996)</ref>.</p><p>In this investigation, we test whether similar effects of goal achievement and goal failure exist in a real onetime customer loyalty promotion. Based on previously documented effects of goal success and failure, we hypothesized the following: Hypothesis 1 (H1). There will be a positive (negative) enduring effect on hotel stays for customers who succeed ( fail) to receive loyalty program rewards.</p><p>Although the previous literature described above leads to hypothesized positive effects of goal success 567 and negative effects of goal failure, note that the marketing literature shows some contrary findings within more applied research domains. Loyalty programs are not the only managerial practice that operate via dynamic incentives. For example, sales control or quota systems share similar characteristics. Customer loyalty programs provide benefits to customers who make a sufficient number of purchases within a specified time period. Similarly, outcome-based sales control systems provide benefits based on meeting sales targets within a specified time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson and Oliver 1987)</ref>.</p><p>This literature has observed that these "outcomebased" control systems can have enduring negative effects on salespeople <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Oliver and Anderson 1994</ref>) by placing a focus on incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deci et al. 1999)</ref>, and subsequently weakening organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Similar arguments exist in the sales promotion literature, contending that discounting may diminish brand equity because consumers attribute their purchase and consumption decisions to the promotion rather than the brand value (see <ref type="bibr">Blattberg and Neslin 1990, Chapter 2)</ref>.</p><p>Yet another possibility is that consumers will exhibit behavior that looks rational and strategic, yielding minimal change in long-term customer loyalty. A potential reaction to time constrained promotions is that consumers (or salespeople) change their behaviors to concentrate purchases (or sales) only during the time of the promotion to succeed in the promotion. This type of phenomena has been noted to the sales promotion literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blattberg and Neslin 1990)</ref> and the sales control literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Oliver and Anderson 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Schwepker and Good 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Badovick et al. 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Brown et al. 2005</ref>. Purchase acceleration during the promotion period and subsequent post-promotion drops have been noted in the loyalty program literature as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lewis 2004)</ref>. The specifications of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lewis (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kopalle et al. (2012)</ref> are consistent with the notion of consumers as rational forward-looking agents for whom reward success or failure have no impact on preference levels.</p><p>In sum, based on previous findings in psychology and marketing we anticipate that goal success will positively impact future purchasing and goal failure will adversely impact future purchasing. However, we acknowledge that other patterns, including negative overall effects due to decreased brand loyalty or no long-term effects due to strategic calculation, are also possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Process Exploration</head><p>We also examined two potential processes that are consistent with the hypothesized goal success and failure effects: (1) Relationship-based reciprocity, and (2) reinforcement learning.</p><p>2.2.1. Relationship-Based Reciprocity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kumar and Shah (2004)</ref> suggest that rewards engender loyalty by establishing beneficial reciprocity between customers and the company. However, the most common type of loyalty program reward structure, i.e., contingent rewards, also allows denying rewards to customers who do not reach goal thresholds. Such goal failure and subsequent denial of rewards may trigger negative reciprocity between customers and the firm. Based on the basic premise of reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fehr and Gachter 2000)</ref>, we would expect that receiving rewards could trigger positive reciprocity and increased purchasing among customers, whereas withholding rewards could trigger negative reciprocity and decreased purchasing.</p><p>More specifically, these effects may be asymmetric within consumer segment levels. Because of heavy prior investment, the firm's most loyal customers may view receipt of rewards as an appropriate return on their investment, resulting in minimal subsequent behavior change. At the same time, due to the same heavy prior investment, high-tier customers may view withholding rewards as a reciprocity violation, maximally influencing subsequent behavior change in the case of goal failure. By comparison, a firm's least loyal consumers have little invested in the firm and may expect little, therefore, yielding positive reciprocity obligations when rewards are received. At the same time, because of the minimal prior investment, withholding rewards is unlikely to be viewed as a reciprocity violation. Based on this notion of relationship-specific reciprocity expectations, we hypothesized the following: Hypothesis 2A (H2A). Reward denial will be most influential for high tier ("Platinum" level) customers whereas reward receipt will be most influential for low tier ("Base" level) customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Reinforcement Learning.</head><p>Recent evidence shows that goal achievement within loyalty programs exerts a positive influence on subsequent purchases by allowing consumers to learn about their own selfefficacy, thus increasing efforts toward future recurring goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dreze and Nunes 2011</ref>). In a one-time reward program such as the one in this investigation, however, subsequent rewards are not in play and therefore standard learning and application of that learning are unlikely to apply.</p><p>A specific type of learning, called reinforcement learning, could still take place, however, in such one-time reward programs. Reinforcement learning, a component of operant conditioning, occurs when people identify contingencies between behavior and positive or negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Skinner 1938</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Skinner , 1969</ref>. When an association between a behavior and a positive outcome arises, the incidence of the original behavior will increase as a means to increase the positive outcome. If, over time, the reward is no longer received as a consequence Marketing Science 35(4), pp. 565-575, © 2016 INFORMS of the behavior, the association will weaken and the behavior will cease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Guttman 1953)</ref>.</p><p>Within one-time reward programs, a reward provides positive reinforcement for purchasing, which could subsequently increase purchasing behavior. Over time, when the reward disappears, the association between reward and purchasing would weaken, and heightened purchasing behavior will end. This leads us to the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2B (H2B). Reward success will lead to increased purchasing, however, over time when rewards are no longer offered, purchasing will revert to previous levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Field Experiment and Results</head><p>The foundation of our research is a field experiment conducted by a major international hotel chain. The experiment involved a short-term loyalty-based promotion offered within the structure of the normal loyalty program. For an 8-month period, loyalty program members in the treatment conditions received an opportunity to earn bonus points for meeting a variety of program conditions.</p><p>In our field experiment, a total of 48,270 existing loyalty members were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and provided with an opportunity to earn bonus points during an 8-month period. There were also 47,257 existing loyalty members in the control group. We observed customers' hotel stays during the eight months before the experiment, the eight months of the experiment, and the eight months following the experiment.</p><p>Our focus here is the impact of succeeding or failing to reach reward thresholds on subsequent customer response. The experiment involved three fully randomized experimental conditions, i.e., a control condition and two levels of threshold conditions. In the LOW threshold condition, customers were asked to increase their activity by a set percentage relative to the baseline period. In the HIGH threshold condition, customers were asked to increase their activity by doubling the percentage in the low condition. 1 Managerial insights were an important input to decide the threshold levels. Managers at the hotel chain believed that their average share of wallet was below 50% for the sample of members in the experiment. Therefore the LOW and HIGH threshold levels were chosen to not more than double baseline activity. For example, if the threshold rates were set at a 20% increase for the LOW condition and 40% in the HIGH condition, a customer staying 10 nights in the baseline period would need to stay 12 nights to qualify for bonus points in the LOW threshold condition or 14 nights if the customer was in the HIGH threshold condition. Note. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0 05) between the numbers with * and those with * * .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the consumption patterns for the control versus treatment groups in the before, within, and post-experiment period. Our first analysis was a difference-in-differences regression of hotel nights. The dependent variable was the hotel nights in the eight months following the experiment minus the nights in the eight months before the experiment. We found that the control group reduced hotel stays by an average of six nights after the experiment period, whereas customers in the treatment groups exhibited only a 5-night reduction, a significant difference (p &lt; 0 01). We did not find significant differences between the low and high threshold treatments.</p><p>These results point to an initial conclusion that the loyalty promotion campaign has a positive enduring impact on customer consumption. However, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports that only 27% of customers attained the goal in the low threshold group and only 21% did so in the high threshold group. Some prior research suggests negative consequences of goal failure for subsequent engagement. We therefore next attempted to separate the enduring effect of goal achievement versus failure within this loyalty program. Note. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0 05) between the numbers of * , * * , and * * * .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Propensity Score Analysis</head><p>A complicating factor in our analysis is that, in addition to the effects of the experiment, we are primarily interested in the long-term effects of hitting versus missing the reward. The issue is that our variable of interest (success or failure) is selectively determined by consumers' behavior rather than being a direct result of experimental manipulation. The before-andafter experimental design and difference-in-differences approach helps to control for customer heterogeneity.</p><p>To further address self-selection concerns in this context we use a propensity scoring procedure. Propensity scoring is designed to help us understand how pre-experimental behaviors can be used to predict reward success. This information can then be applied to the control group to predict the likelihood that a control group member would have earned a reward if placed in the treatment. This estimate is then used in an analysis of post-reward behavior. This analysis is designed to control for the self-selection that occurs in terms of customer response to treatment conditions.</p><p>Our propensity-based analysis has three steps. The first step involves a logistic regression of reward achievement using customers in the treatment conditions. In this model we regress reward success against customer activity levels and loyalty status observed in the eight months before the experiment. The second step uses the coefficients from the logistic regression to score the members of the control group. These propensity scores define the likelihood that each customer would achieve a loyalty-based reward if included in the treatment. The third step involves econometric analyses of post-program activity levels. The propensity scores are included as explanatory variables to account for self-selection driven consumption effects due to the experimental treatments.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reports the results of the first step logistic regression. The logistic regression uses a binary indicator of reward attainment as the dependent variable. Hotel nights in the pre-period and dummy variables for Gold and Platinum status are used as the key explanatory factors. The complete model includes these primary factors and interactions between pre-period nights and loyalty status and an estimate of each customer's trend in terms of stays during the preperiod. Each customer's trend is estimated with a Bayesian regression for the eight months of the preperiod experiment. This variable is intended to pick up natural trends in use rates. Key results from the model include significant positive coefficients associated with night stays in the pre-period and positive significant effects for trend (individual time trend slope) and trend squared. These results are especially salient as they capture the relationship between natural (exogenous) upward trends in demand and reward achievement.</p><p>We use the coefficients from Model 3 to score each member of the control group. We then construct two samples for further analysis. The first sample includes the control group and members of the treatment that earned a reward. The second sample includes the  control group and the members of the experiment that failed to earn a reward. We then executed several analyses using the two populations. Specifically, we conducted difference-in-differences analyses of hotel nights, revenues, and stays for the post-versus preperiods. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4 and 5</ref> report the results of these analyses for specifications that include the propensity score or not, for the success and failure plus control populations. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows results for the combined reward success and control group sample. The propensity score acts as a control for the likelihood that the consumer's natural activity level would have earned a loyaltybased reward even in the absence of the treatment. A key comparison across the models that include and do not include the propensity score is therefore the difference in the "Treatment" effects. Given the nature of the sample, being a member of the treatment group for the population analyzed in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> is equivalent to having earned a reward. In the models that include the propensity score the treatment coefficients are smaller for each dependent measure than the values in the models without the scores. For example, the estimated impact of reward achievement is 8.9 incremental nights over the 8-month post-experiment observation period. By comparison, in the model that does not include the propensity score the estimate is 12.9 nights. Controlling for the propensity of consumers to naturally expand consumption levels allows for the decomposition of growth due to reward success versus exogenous change in demand. In terms of other metrics, we also estimate that reward success leads to an incremental $765 in revenue and about three stays during the 8-month post period.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> repeats the analysis for the combined control and reward failure populations. In this case controlling for propensity to earn rewards helps us separate natural changes in consumption levels that lead to underestimation of reward failure effects. The difference-indifferences analysis with propensity scores indicates that reward failure leads to a reduction of 5.5 nights and $377 in revenue over the 8-month post period. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model-Based Results</head><p>The preceding results highlight the differential impact of goal achievement and failure on subsequent consumer purchasing. In this section we empirically test a behavioral theory of relationship-based reciprocity. Specifically, we address the question of whether and how customers in different relationship tiers react differently to goal achievement and failure.</p><p>For this test we use a subsample of the customer population. Specifically, we limit the sample to customers that remain in the same loyalty segment during the data collection period. The logic of this approach is that changes in relationship status tiers can complicate interpretation of the results. For example, a customer who achieves a goal and simultaneously improves her loyalty status presents an empirical challenge since any incremental stays might be attributable to goal achievement, tier improvement or an interaction between the two events. Note that restricting the sample in the preceding manner results in a more conservative test. Because achievement is correlated with status improvement and failure with status decline, this sample removes a possible source of bias that would tend to overpredict our hypotheses. This results in more conservative tests of whether customers in a high tier relationship would be more affected by goal failure than those in a low tier relationship, and whether customers in a low tier relationship would be more affected by goal achievement than those in a high tier relationship.</p><p>Given that the experiment occurs over an 8-month period and that we have data on member's activities for the eight months preceding and following the experiment, we leveraged the panel structure of the data to control for observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the monthly hotel night consumption. We estimated a random-effect Tobit model using monthly hotel night consumption as the dependent variable. The Tobit model is used since hotel night consumption is left censored at zero. We assume that there is a latent variable N * it that is a function of the observed monthly hotel night consumption, N it</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N it = N * it if N * it &gt; 0 0 elsewhere (1)</formula><p>Term N * it follows as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N * it = 0 + 1 Gold i + 2 Pltn i + 3 Hit it + 4 Hit it × Gold i + 5 Hit it × Pltn i + 6 HitH it + 7 HitH it × Gold i + 8 HitH it × Pltn i + 9 Miss it + 10 Miss it × Gold i + 11 Miss it × Pltn i + 12 MissH it + 13 MissH it × Gold i + 14 MissH it × Pltn i + 15 IncentM i + 16 IncentH i + 17 LogPrice it + 18 T 1t + 19 T 2t + 20 T 2t × HurdleL i + 21 T 2t × HurdleH i + 22 T 2t × IncentM i + 23 T 2t × IncentH i + 24 GoalDist it + 25 TierDist it + u i + it (2)</formula><p>where 0 represents the average monthly hotel nights for customers in the control group in the eight months following the experiment; Gold i and Pltn i are indicators of program status. The three terms Hit it , Hit it × Gold i , and Hit it × Pltn i capture the difference in average monthly hotel nights between goal-achieving customers and those in the control group for the baseline (Club), Gold, and Platinum members, respectively. The next three terms, HitH it , HitH it × Gold i , and HitH it × Pltn i capture the difference between the low and high hurdle goal-achievement customers. Similarly, the three terms, Miss it , Miss it × Gold i , and Miss it × Pltn i capture the difference in average monthly hotel nights between goalfailure customers and those in the control group for the baseline (Club), Gold, and Platinum members, respectively. The MissH it , MissH it × Gold i , and MissH it × Pltn i terms account for the potential differences between the low and high hurdle goal-failure customers. The effect of incentive levels in the post-experiment period are accounted for with the two terms IncentM i and IncentH i (medium and high incentives). We also include LogPrice it , which is a weighted average of monthly hotel prices. The weights are individual-specific based on each customer's share of nights across all of the hotels.</p><p>In addition, we include T 1t to indicate the eight months before the experiment, and T 2t as the eight months of the experiment.</p><p>We also include terms that reflect the dynamic nature of the reward program since both the experiment rewards and loyalty status eligibility require customers to achieve a certain number of hotel nights within a limited time window. We include GoalDist it and TierDist it to capture separate types of points pressure. The two terms are measured on a percentage scale to indicate the distance towards the loyalty promotion goal or the next level loyalty status. We also include a random effect u i to capture unobserved individual-specific heterogeneity.</p><p>Term it is assumed to follow independently identical normal distributions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> reports the estimation results. As specified in Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), the results address whether customers in a high tier relationship are more affected by goal failure than those in a low tier relationship, and whether customers in a low tier relationship are more affected by goal achievement than those in a high tier relationship.</p><p>There are three patterns worth noting in the results. First, there is a clear distinction in monthly hotel nights for the baseline (Club), Gold, and Platinum customers in the control group in the eight months following the experiment. For example, Platinum customers in the control group stay 6.9 more nights than baseline (Club) members in the control group.</p><p>In terms of the enduring effects of reward success, baseline (Club) customers who hit the experiment goals stayed 1.8 or 1.9 more nights per month depending on the threshold level in the eight months following the experiment. Gold members also significantly increase stays following a success but this group's increase is significantly lower than the base members at approximately 0.6 nights per month (p &lt; 0 01). By contrast, for Platinum members who hit the threshold there is no positive impact on the monthly hotel nights in the eight months following the experiments.</p><p>In terms of reward failures, we find significant negative effects across all loyalty tiers. Baseline customers who missed the experiment goal reduced stays by between 0.1 and 0.15 nights per month depending on the threshold required (p &lt; 0 01). This decrease is significantly larger for the goal-failure Gold (0.8 nights per month; p &lt; 0 01) and Platinum (0.5 nights per month; p &lt; 0 01).</p><p>The patterns are consistent with the premise of relationship-based reciprocity: Customers in a high tier relationship are more affected by goal failure and less affected by goal achievement than are customers in a low tier relationship.</p><p>The results also show some additional patterns, which are not the main focus of this research. For example, results confirm a behavioral pattern of points pressure documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nunes and Dreze (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kivetz et al. (2006)</ref> with the significantly negative coefficients associated with GoalDist it and TierDist it . As customers move closer towards a goal, they exert more effort. Furthermore, the fraction of variance due to unobserved individual heterogeneity (random effect) is approximately 20%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Alternative Explanations</head><p>In this section we extend the previous model specification to test for the possibility of reinforcement learning. As explicated in the development of H2B, if reinforcement learning is the driver of post-promotion behavior then we would expect to see the following: A reward would cause an increase in demand trajectory while a failure to earn a reward might cause a decrease. However, by contrast to the relationship-oriented explanation proposed, demand would gradually revert to its old trajectory following the event.</p><p>To investigate the possibility of reinforcement learning we test whether demand levels gradually revert to previous trajectory following the success or failure event. We do this by adding three terms to the previous panel Tobit specification. In particular we add a time trend that begins after the promotion and interactions between the time trend and binary indicators of reward success (HIT) and failure (MISS).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref> provides estimation results for the model with the three additional terms. For our question of interest the two key terms are the interactions of hitting and missing with the post-program time trend. A reinforcement learning explanation would suggest that the interaction would be negative for the HIT × Trend interaction and positive for the MISS × Trend interaction. We find positive coefficients associated with both interactions. This implies that we only see reversion to previous levels following a miss. For the reward achievers the positive coefficient suggests a positive feedback effect. Based on these findings the data does not support H2B. At the same time, we still find patterns similar to those in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, which are consistent with the premise of relationship-based reciprocity in H2A.</p><p>We acknowledge that our investigation of reinforcement learning is somewhat different than previous studies. In our case, the focal loyalty promotion does not continue following reward success or failure. However, while the focal promotion ends, the loyalty program itself is ongoing. Our reinforcement conjectures are based on the notion that consumers learn about their capabilities within the short-term promotion and that these learnings drive response to the permanent program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we examine the post-promotion effects of a loyalty program promotion conducted by a major hotel company. Although such frequent buyer programs are intended to foster customer loyalty and increase metrics such as retention and customer lifetime value, these programs often include reward structures that may have negative effects on subsequent customer purchasing. We hypothesize that successfully earning or failing to achieve a loyalty-based reward will have enduring effects on purchasing, and further speculate that these effects could vary based on the previous nature of the customer relationship.</p><p>Although participation in the program led to an overall positive effect on subsequent purchasing, the effects of goal success or goal failure diverge once separated. Over the eight months following the program we estimate that reward success leads to an incremental $765 in revenues for a customer who earns rewards. However, we also estimate that failing to earn a reward results in a reduction in revenues of about $375. Given these results, firms need to carefully design loyalty-based promotions to balance success and failure rates.</p><p>We also find asymmetric effects of success and failure within loyalty tiers. In terms of success, we find that the positive long-term effects are negatively related to program status. Econometrically, we identify significantly larger long-term positive consequences for base members than for Gold or Platinum members. In fact, we do not observe a significant positive impact of success on Platinum members. By contrast, the negative impact of program failure is significant for all groups but the impact on Gold and Platinum members is significantly more negative than for the base members.</p><p>The current study is based on results of a large scale field experiment conducted by a major international hotel company. As such, the results have significant ecological validity. However, the nature of the experiment also involves limitations. Given that the experiment was conducted with actual customers, data collection was purposively nonintrusive and little burden was imposed on subjects. This is relevant given that the academic communities want to go beyond the documentation of enduring behavioral changes to investigate the underlying drivers of the long-term effects.</p><p>Future research could be designed to focus more on underlying cognitive processes. In the current study we are limited to logical inferences based on econometric results. It may be useful to design research that is less constrained by commercial objectives and better situated for collecting data related to underlying consumer decision processes. Collection of psychological measures may be useful for reaching and more precisely determining the mechanisms through which reward success or failure impact customer relationships across different consumer segments.</p><p>In sum, the current findings highlight a managerial dilemma related to the type of promotion under study. The promotion itself drives incremental revenue and seems to have positive or negligible effects on base members depending on whether the reward is earned. The promotion, therefore, would seem to be of great value for managing the "base" segment of customers. However, the promotion also presents potential problems for the firm's most valuable customers when there is a possibility that rewards will be withheld. A possible solution is to only offer such programs to base level consumers. That said, however, the dilemma exists that excluding the highest level program tiers from a promotion might have an adverse effect on the firm's relationships with its most valuable customers. Future investigations should explore ways that firms can tailor loyalty promotions to meet the diverse needs of multiple customer segments.</p></div>
