<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Consider a market where a number of firms each offer a product of distinct quality and consumers differ in their willingness to pay for quality. The firms have constant, but likely different, unit variable costs, and they compete through setting prices simultaneously. In this vertically differentiated industry, we are mainly concerned with the following question: When is producing a higher-quality product more (less) profitable at equilibrium? To better illuminate the nature of this question, it is helpful to first revisit two familiar benchmarks. If the firms differ only in product quality, but have the same unit variable cost, then offering a higher-quality product is more profitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Shaked and Sutton 1982)</ref>. If the firms offer a homogeneous product, but differ in unit variable costs, then the firm with the lowest cost is more profitable by the standard Bertrand argument. However, the picture becomes much less clear if the firms differ in both quality and unit costs. By tackling this central question, this paper aims to fulfill two purposes. First, our results can provide a firm with useful guidelines on how to better approach its product-positioning strategies by taking into account its product and process know-how relative to that of its competitors. Sec-ond, we all observe that in some industries it is the firms offering superior product qualities that dominate, while in some others it is those with the highest operating efficiency that rule. It seems intuitive that the former emerges when the costs of the highestquality firms are not substantially higher, and the latter emerges when the qualities of the lowest-cost firms are not substantially lower than those of the other firms. We make this intuition precise by pointing out the exact industry conditions for each scenario to arise.</p><p>Besides, this paper also makes a technical contribution. For the above setup with multiple firms and a general quality-cost structure, expressions of the equilibrium prices are too complex to allow a direct manipulation of firm profitability. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Instead of seeking an explicit price equilibrium, this paper introduces an inductive method for ranking the firms' Jing: On the Profitability of Firms in a Differentiated Industry <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science 25(3), pp. 248-259, © 2006 INFORMS 249</ref> various performance measures (profit margin, profits, and market share) based on the system of first-order conditions. This method appears to be rather effective for tasks that do not require precise knowledge of the equilibrium prices (such as establishing the ranking or bounds of the firms' performance measures; cf. Propositions 1, 2, 4, 7, and A1 in the technical appendix) and may not be effective for the other tasks (such as determining the equilibrium quality location of the firms for a given unit cost function).</p><p>Our main model assumes that the firms' product qualities and unit costs are fixed exogenously, and that consumer types are uniformly distributed. Here, our major result is to introduce the concept of relative cost efficiency, whose monotonicity in quality is shown to ensure that of firm profitability. A firm's relative cost efficiency is a comprehensive measure that captures the unit costs and qualities of both the firm itself and its immediate competitors, for a given distribution of consumer types. We also demonstrate how the results may be useful in (re)positioning a new (old) product. In particular, we show when a firm with an inferior product may outperform its competitors with superior offerings. Besides, a firm selling a higher-quality good is more profitable if it has a higher quality/cost ratio (which we call its absolute cost efficiency). A set of lower and upper bounds on each firm's profitability is also given.</p><p>The main model is then extended in two directions. First, we explore the unit cost functions demonstrating monotone profitability, when the firms compete by locating their products according to the same cost function and setting prices. We also show that the notion of relative cost efficiency and our inductionbased analytical approach hold valid for a logconcave distribution of consumer types. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The present paper is related to the literature on vertical differentiation in economics and marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mussa and Rosen 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabszewicz and Thisse 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sutton 1982, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Itoh 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moorthy 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moorthy , 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Champsaur and Rochet 1989)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mussa and Rosen (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Itoh (1983), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moorthy (1984)</ref> deal with how a monopolist firm should price discriminate against its consumers. In a duopoly setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shaked and Sutton (1982)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moorthy (1988)</ref> characterize the subgame perfect equilibria in qualities and prices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabszewicz and Thisse (1980)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shaked and Sutton (1983)</ref> show that under certain conditions on the cost function, the market can only sustain a limited number of firms at a Nash price equilibrium, even in the absence of any fixed costs of entry. Therefore, comparing the profitability of firms is not the focus of these papers. In addition to these Bertrand models, there also exist Cournot models of vertical differentiation, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gal-Or (1985)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moorthy (1985</ref><ref type="bibr">) and, more recently, De Fraja (1996</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Johnson and Myatt (2003)</ref>. The article by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Johnson and Myatt (2003)</ref> examines when a multiproduct monopolist may expand or contract its product line in response to entry.</p><p>This paper is also related to the marketing literature on product-line design and pricing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moorthy 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Oren et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Reibstein and Gatignon 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shugan 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dobson and Kalish 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balachander and Srinivasan 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Randall et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Villas-Boas 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Desai 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tyagi 2004</ref>). However, most of these papers are monopoly models and thus do not address the issue of comparing the firms' profitability. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Villas-Boas (1998)</ref> shows that a manufacturer selling through an intermediary should design its product line differently than when selling directly to end consumers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Randall et al. (1998)</ref> provide an empirical examination on the relationship between the length of a vertical product line and brand equity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Desai (2001)</ref>, consumers' sensitivity to horizontal features is shown to affect the cannibalization between products of different qualities. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The main model is presented in §2. Section 3 shows how monotonicity of relative cost efficiencies implies that of firm profit and profit margin in equilibrium and discusses its managerial implications. We then derive further results involving absolute cost efficiency and profitability bounds. Section 4 studies cost functions embodying monotone profitability and extends the main model to a logconcave distribution of consumer types. Section 5 concludes the paper. The proofs of the propositions in the text are given in the appendix. A technical appendix at http://mktsci. pubs.informs.org contains expanded material referred to in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Main Model</head><p>The main model considers a short-run scenario in which both the number of firms and their quality and cost levels are fixed. In this market, there are K firms with constant unit variable costs. Specifically, firm k produces a good of quality v k at a constant unit cost c k , and there are no fixed costs. The firms compete through setting prices simultaneously. We assume that the quality levels of the firms are all distinct to avoid trivialities due to the Bertrand argument. Without loss of generality, the firms are indexed such that 0 Connecting each pair of adjacent points (v k−1 c k−1 ) and (v k c k ) with a straight line would lead to the cost trajectory of this oligopoly. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">&lt; v 1 &lt; v 2 &lt; • • • &lt; v K .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">d k = c k − c k−1 v k − v k−1 for k = 1 K (1)</formula><p>where v 0 = c 0 = 0. Here a convention is to view v 0 as a virtual product with zero quality and no cost. Each d k represents the slope of the cost trajectory between v k−1 and v k . Because no restrictions are imposed on the firms' costs (other than c k &lt; v k ; due to our specification of consumer demand below, any product with c k ≥ v k cannot generate positive sales, even when priced at cost), d k need not be monotonic in k. In other words, there may be zigzags in the cost trajectory. Each consumer either purchases precisely one unit from the products offered or does not purchase. Assume that a consumer's utility is multiplicatively separable in product quality and her own type characteristic. Without further loss of generality, we adopt the familiar Mussa-Rosen utility function. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> A consumer of type obtains net utility v − p from a product of quality v priced at p. Thus, consumer type represents her constant marginal willingness to pay for quality. To ease exposition, we assume that is uniformly distributed 5 on 0 1 .</p><p>Denote the price of firm k as p k . Connecting each pair of adjacent points v k−1 p k−1 and v k p k in the quality-price space with a straight line, one would obtain the price trajectory of this oligopoly. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">k = p k − p k−1 v k − v k−1 for k = 1 K (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where v 0 = p 0 = 0, i.e., v 0 is a free product with zero utility. Selecting v 0 amounts to not purchasing at all. Here k is the slope of the price trajectory between firms k − 1 and k. A consumer of type k obtains the same level of net utility from buying v k−1 and v k , and she is therefore indifferent between these two quality levels. A familiar implication of the Mussa-Rosen utility function is that consumers between k and k+1 (with K+1 = 1) will purchase product k. Therefore, if the prices are such that k is nondecreasing in k, the demand and profit of firm k are</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s k = k+1 − k (3) and k = p k − c k k+1 − k (4)</formula><p>respectively. The firms set prices simultaneously to maximize their own profits.</p><p>A Nash equilibrium exists in this pricing game, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shaked and Sutton (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Caplin and Nalebuff (1991)</ref>. Apparently, the firms have no incentive to price below cost. Because we focus on the situation where all K firms are active at equilibrium, in the sense that each attracts strictly positive demand at a price at or above its unit cost, the equilibrium price trajectory is increasing and convex. Let r k = 1/ v k − v k−1 denote the degree of product differentiation between firms k and k − 1. The first-order conditions (FOC) are</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">k+1 − k = p k − c k r k+1 + r k for firm k ≤ K − 1 (5) 1 − K = p K − c K r K for firm K (6)</formula><p>Firm k's FOC equates the marginal benefit to the marginal cost of a unit increase in its price p k : The lefthand side (LHS) equals firm k's demand and represents its profit gain from the unit price increase. A unit increase in p k (k &lt; K) also lowers k+1 by r k+1 and raises k by r k , thus driving away original purchasers of v k in the number of r k+1 + r k . Likewise, a unit increase in p K will cause r K of firm K's consumers to switch to firm K − 1. The right-hand side (RHS) thus stands for firm k's profit loss due to the unit price increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analysis</head><p>In this section, we introduce a set of production efficiency measures and show that their monotonicity in quality ensures that of firm profit and per-unit margin, respectively, in a Nash price equilibrium. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> A firm with a strategic orientation is concerned about not only its absolute profit level but also its competitiveness relative to its rivals. Our analysis can aid such a strategic firm in selecting and calibrating its product strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Relative Cost Efficiencies and Monotone</head><p>Profitability Because profit maximization is often imputed to be a firm's highest objective, we shall first investigate the conditions under which offering a higher-or lowerquality product generates a higher profit. Our first step is to translate the FOCs into expressions of firms' profits, instead of prices. From (4), (5), and (6), at equilibrium firm k's profit is k = p k − c k 2 r k+1 + r k . Therefore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p k = c k + k / r k+1 + r k</formula><p>where r K+1 = 0 (7) With (7), we can then rewrite ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r k+1 k+1 / r k+2 + r k+1 = 2 r k+1 + r k k − r k k−1 / r k + r k−1 − d k+1 − d k (8)</formula><p>for k ≤ K − 1, where 0 = r 0 = 0, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">0 = 2 √ r K K − r K K−1 / r K + r K−1 − 1 − d K for firm K (9)</formula><p>Equations ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) allow for direct manipulation of the firms' profits. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">t 1 ≡ 2 r 2 + r 1 − r 2 r 3 + r 2 t K ≡ 2 √ r K − r K r K + r K−1 and for 1 &lt; k &lt; K, t k ≡ 2 r k+1 + r k − r k r k + r k−1 − r k+1 r k+2 + r k+1</formula><p>where r K+1 = 0</p><p>Because each r k &gt; 0, we have t k &gt; 0. Just like r k , each t k still measures the degree of differentiation between firm k's product v k and those of its neighboring firms, except that t k takes into account the qualities of up to two (instead of one) firms below and above v k .</p><p>Definition 1. Firm k's relative cost efficiency w.r.t. profit is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E k ≡ d k+1 − d k /t k , where 1 ≤ k ≤ K and d K+1 = 1.</formula><p>E k incorporates the costs and qualities of both firm k itself and those offering adjacent quality levels. Conceptually, it is a quality-weighted measure of firm k's production efficiency relative to its immediate competitors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Proposition 1. If E 1 ≤ • • • ≤ E K (E 1 ≥ • • • ≥ E K ), then 1 ≤ • • • ≤ K ( 1 ≥ • • • ≥ K ) in equilibrium. Further, if in equilibrium 1 = • • • = K , then E 1 = • • • = E K .</formula><p>When a firm offering a higher-quality product is more (less) efficient according to E k , it also obtains greater (lower) profit at equilibrium. By Proposition 1, a necessary and sufficient condition for the firms to obtain equal profits is when they possess the same relative cost efficiency.</p><p>Adding up the K FOCs in (8)-( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">2r 1 + r 2 √ r 1 + r 2 √ 1 + K 2 r k + r k+1 k = 1 − d 1 (10)</formula><p>Thus, in equilibrium the weighted sum of √ k in the industry depends only on the unit cost of the lowestquality product but not on that of any other product. If 1 = • • • = K , then (10) readily gives the common profit level.</p><p>We now turn to profit margin, which measures a firm's per-unit profitability. Because unit variable costs are constant by assumption, we may alternatively view firm k's profit margin m k = p k − c k as its decision variable, and rewriting the FOCs (( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)) in terms of m k greatly simplifies the analysis. Again, the notion of relative cost efficiency plays a central role in deriving the next result.</p><p>Definition 2. Firm k's relative cost efficiency w.r.t. profit margin is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E m 1 ≡ d 2 − d 1 / r 2 + 2r 1 for Firm 1 and E m k ≡ d k+1 − d k / r k+1 + r k for firm k &gt; 1</formula><p>, where d K+1 = 1 and r K+1 = 0, respectively.</p><p>Compared with E k , E m k allows a more concrete interpretation. For 1 &lt; k &lt; K, E m k can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E m k = r k+1 c k+1 + r k c k−1 / r k+1 + r k − c k ,</formula><p>where the first term is the quality-weighted average cost of firms k − 1 and k + 1. Therefore, E m k represents the quality-weighted cost (dis)advantage of firm k relative to the two firms with which it directly competes. <ref type="figure">Likewise, E m</ref> 1 (E m K ) reflects the quality-weighted cost (dis)advantage of Firm 1 (K) relative to Firm 2 (K − 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Proposition 2. If E m 1 ≤ • • • ≤ E m K E m 1 ≥ • • • ≥ E m K , then m 1 ≤ • • • ≤ m K m 1 ≥ • • • ≥ m K in equilibrium. Further, if in equilibrium m 1 = • • • = m K , then E m 1 = • • • = E m K .</formula><p>Its proof is given in the technical appendix at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org. Proposition 2 thus parallels Proposition 1 in spirit: The monotonicity of relative cost efficiency E m k implies that of profit margin. When the firms obtain equal profit margin, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">m 1 = • • • = m K = m * , summation of the K FOCs yields m * = 1 − d 1 / 2 K 1 r k .</formula><p>Not surprisingly, m * decreases when the products become less differentiated (i.e., the r k s are larger) or when the number of firms K increases.</p><p>The conditions in Propositions 1 and 2 may at first give an impression of being complex. However, such an impression is somewhat alleviated, considering that they enable us to compare the firms' equilibrium profitability without solving the pricing game, which is much more daunting, as noted earlier. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Further, these propositions become much easier to implement for many frequently studied production technologies.</p><p>Example 1 (The Linear Technology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabszewicz and Thisse 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Shaked and Sutton 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Ronnen 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Lehmann-Grube 1997</ref>). When d k = a &lt; 1 for all k, Propositions 1 and 2 predict that profitability is increasing in product quality.</p><p>Example 2 (The Quadratic Technology (e.g., Moorthy 1988)). When c v = v 2 , we have </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">d k = v k + v k−1 for all k,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">E m k = v k+1 − v k v k − v k−1 for 1 &lt; k &lt; K, and E m K = 1 − v K − v K−1 v K − v K−1 .</formula><p>Example 3 (The Technology Embodying Fixed-Quality Increments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gabszewicz and Thisse 1980)</ref>). <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Suppose the product qualities are spaced as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">v 1 = 2, v k − v k−1 = 1, for 2 ≤ k ≤ K, which implies 2r 1 = r 2 = • • • = r K = 1. The condition in Propo- sition 2 then reduces to d 2 − d 1 ≤ • • • ≤ d K+1 − d K or d 2 − d 1 ≥ • • • ≥ d K+1 − d K ; the condition in Proposition 1 is also greatly simplified.</formula><p>Besides, the conditions in the propositions will also simplify as the number of firms decreases. In particular, Propositions 1 and 2 have the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 1. Suppose K = 2. Then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(1) 1 2 if v 1 c 2 − v 2 c 1 / v 2 − v 1 − c 2 − c 1 √ v 1 v 2 . (2) m 1 m 2 if v 1 c 2 − v 2 c 1 / v 2 − v 1 − c 2 − c 1 2v 2 − v 1 .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Managerial Implications</head><p>The above analysis focuses on the trade-off between product differentiation and production efficiency. In some markets (such as high-tech and pharmaceuticals), product differentiation plays a more prominent role that overshadows production efficiency, and the most lucrative firms are those offering cutting-edge product qualities. In markets lacking product differentiation, however, the most successful firms are often those operating with extreme cost efficiencies. Our analysis above may serve as a theoretical foundation for when either case is more likely to emerge and has further managerial implications.</p><p>(1) "Going cheap" may not be a bad strategy. Perhaps the more interesting result above relates to when a firm with an inferior product may outperform its rivals with superior offerings. While it is natural for firms to covet the highest quality and lowest cost in the industry, in reality the two are often conflicting objectives. Because a better-quality good demands higher consumer valuation, a customary misconception is that the high-end market is more lucrative than the low-end market and that quality outweighs cost as a critical success factor. Consequently, the cost side and the low-end market often do not receive enough managerial attention. Propositions 1 and 2 help make it clear that efficiency in production and distribution matters as much as product quality. In particular, a firm with the lowest quality can be the most profitable if it has the highest relative cost efficiency. Climbing the quality ladder pays only if the incremental quality does not entail an excessive increase in unit cost.</p><p>According to Business Week (2005), in the fall of 2004 French automaker Renault rolled out the nofrills Logan, a mid-sized sedan to sell at as little as 5,000 euros (or $6,000) in European markets, with an estimated production cost of $1,089, less than half the $2,468 estimate for an equivalent Western auto. According to Kenneth Melville, head of the Logan design team, the concept of Logan was "Reliable engineering without a lot of electronics, cheap to build and easy to maintain and repair." In the 1990s, Dell emerged as a leader in the computer industry, mainly due to effective cost control through selling directly to customers and integrating its supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Magretta 1998)</ref>.</p><p>(2) Entry. Positioning and pricing a new brand is an important decision frequently made by firms. Suppose that a potential entrant knows its own unit cost at each potential quality level as well as the quality and cost levels of the incumbents. 9 Following entry, the incumbent firms can readily adjust prices but usually cannot rapidly adjust qualities, as relocating a product can be a costly and time-consuming process. Anticipating this, among its feasible choices the foresighted entrant will select an entry point according to its profitability in the postentry price equilibrium.</p><p>Proposition 1 may help facilitate a more informed entry decision, as our analysis reveals information about the profitability ranking associated with each candidate entry point. To simplify illustration, consider a market currently controlled by a monopolist operating at 5 2 in the quality-cost space (i.e., quality 5 and unit cost 2). Suppose a potential entrant is deliberating between two possible entry points, A: 3 0 6 and B: 6 3 . Then, Corollary 1 indicates that entering at A (B) makes it earn strictly higher (lower) profit than the incumbent.</p><p>(3) Repositioning a product. Even though relocating a product does not occur instantly and costlessly, over time firms may have the incentive to reposition their products as technology, consumer taste, or competition evolves. For example, on July 11, 2005 Hewlett-Packard (HP) launched a low-cost inkjet printing technology whose printing quality and speed can match typical laser printers, which gave HP a huge manufacturing cost advantage (Associated Press).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Cost Functions Demonstrating Monotone</head><p>Profitability Our analysis above has focused on a short-run scenario in which the firms' quality and unit cost levels are assumed to be fixed exogenously. While this treatment admits possible idiosyncrasies in the firms' technological know-how, the following question also arises naturally: If the firms face some common production technology (as represented by a unit variable cost function) and endogenize their quality decisions according to it, then what properties of the technology ensure monotone profitability? <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We now explore answers to this question.</p><p>Suppose the relevant quality space is v v .

Because Proposition 5 holds for any quality configuration, the identified sufficient conditions are stronger than those required for an equilibrium quality location. The rationale behind part (1) is as follows. For a weakly concave unit cost function, a consumer's marginal valuation for quality ( ) remains constant, but the marginal cost of quality improvement (c v ) decreases as quality increases, which gives the higherquality product a competitive advantage. Note that for a weakly concave cost function, any quality configuration demonstrates increasing absolute cost efficiency and, hence, k &gt; k−1 follows from Corollary 2.</p><p>Marketing Science 25(3), pp. 248-259, © 2006 INFORMS However, Proposition 5(1) gives a much stronger result regarding profit margins: The profit margin of firm k is more than twice that of firm k − 1. In some industries (e.g., semiconductors and pharmaceuticals), quality improvement primarily entails expenditures of fixed costs in R&amp;D, but the unit variable costs may rise at a decreasing rate as quality improves. Proposition 5(1) predicts that in such industries firms with better-quality products are more profitable. Such a prediction appears to be largely coherent with casual empirical impressions.</p><p>The condition in Proposition 5( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is essentially the finiteness condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shaked and Sutton (1983)</ref>. Unlike horizontal differentiation, a vertically differentiated market may only sustain a finite number of firms in equilibrium (even in the absence of fixed costs of entry) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gabszewicz and</ref><ref type="bibr">Thisse 1980, Shaked and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sutton 1983)</ref>. The latter further gives a necessary and sufficient condition for this finiteness property, whose essence is that, if the products were offered for sale at costs, all consumers would agree in their utility ranking (in either increasing or decreasing order) of the products. In our current model, this finiteness condition simply reduces to c v &gt; 1 on v v , which ensures monotone decreasing profitability. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Because consumer types are confined to 0 1 in our model, when c v &gt; 1 on v v , all consumers would rank the utilities of the products in strictly decreasing order of quality if they were made available at unit variable costs. Intuitively, if the production technology is such that the marginal cost of quality improvement exceeds the maximal marginal consumer valuation over the quality space, offering a lower-quality product is strictly more profitable.</p><p>Next, we consider a convex unit cost function. For tractability, we confine our attention to a duopoly and assume that the two firms choose both quality and price simultaneously. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Also in a duopoly setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lehmann-Grube (1997)</ref> shows that when the fixed cost of quality development is convex, the firm choosing a higher quality makes higher profits in equilibrium. However, he assumes that unit variable costs are zero at any quality. Proposition 6.

If vc v + c v ≤ 1 (vc v + c v ≥ 1), then 1 &lt; 2 ( 1 &gt; 2 ) in equilibrium.</formula><p>Conceptually, the LHS of the condition in Proposition 6(1) measures the "steepness" of the cost curve in the quality domain.

In some sense, Proposition 6 complements Proposition 5(2).</p><p>To make Proposition 6 more transparent, we provide two examples involving polynomial and exponential cost functions, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper has identified conditions for producing a higher-or lower-quality good to be more profitable, as well as a set of profitability bounds. Proposition A1 in the technical appendix at http://mktsci. pubs.informs.org also gives a sufficient condition for market share to be monotone in quality. These results can help marketing managers (and consultants) understand the competitive landscape in their industries and facilitate the framing of effective product strategies. Specifically, they can help assess the profitability of a potential brand location. Besides, this paper also makes a technical contribution: Our inductive method avoids computing an explicit price equilibrium, which is often intractable.</p><p>Our main model takes as fixed the quality location of the firms. At the core of our analysis are the notions of relative and absolute cost efficiencies. A firm's relative cost efficiency refers to its quality-adjusted cost (dis)advantage relative to its immediate competitors and is thus a "localized" efficiency measure. As competition itself is localized in a vertical setting, this measure proves sufficient for establishing the order of firm performance. An ideal property of relative cost efficiency is that its monotonicity in quality indicates that of profitability. A firm's absolute cost efficiency, defined as the ratio between its quality and its unit cost, captures its quality output from each dollar of input in the production process and thus does not reflect on any other firm. Note that these two measures have different domains of applicability. For example, absolute cost efficiency cannot help predict when producing a lower-quality good is more profitable.</p><p>The current paper has its limitations. As in many previous studies, we have also assumed that each consumer demands zero or one unit of the product. A durable good is a commonly used justification for the unit-demand assumption. Perhaps our most critical assumption is the Mussa-Rosen utility function. This is admittedly our key limitation, but its multiplicative form allows a precise characterization of the firms' demand and profits, which leads to a tractable analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gal-Or (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Moorthy (1984)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Champsaur and Rochet (1989)</ref> are exemplary papers that employ more general utility functions. Extending the current analysis along their tradition is left for future work. For the most part, we have used the uniform distribution of consumers to ease exposition, but Proposition 7 suggests that the spirit of relative cost efficiency and our inductive method hold valid for a logconcave consumer distribution. In Propositions 5 and 6, we have also explored the set of cost functions that demonstrate monotone profitability, even with endogenous quality location.

Combining these two equations gives 1 = c v 1 − r 2 /r 1 c v 2 − c v 1 . Therefore, the equilibrium profits are 1 = c v 2 − c v 1 2 r 1 + r 2 / r 1 2 and 2 = 1 − c v 2 2 /r 2 .
