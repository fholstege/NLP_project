<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>discrete bidding generates higher seller welfare than continuous.</p><p>We propose a covert shilling model that requires shilling sellers, and any confederates and auctioneers, to outwardly act no differently than with reserves, to avoid detection. We identify cases where the seller optimally shills once the bona fide bidding has stopped, and identify the corresponding optimal point to stop shilling and accept the next bona fide bid, if offered. This stopping point does not depend on where bona fide bidding stops, or aggressiveness, or the number of bidders, or on whether shill bids alternate with bona fide bids or are consecutively entered. We also find that the optimal lowest acceptable bid with shilling can be higher (lower) than that with reserves if the highest valuator is sufficiently unaggressive (aggressive). By comparison, in continuous bidding shilling and reserves yield identical lowest acceptable bids.</p><p>Sometimes the seller using a shilling strategy optimally should not shill at all, and instead accept the bid where bona fide bidding stops. This can occur when that bid, or the number of bidders, is sufficiently high, or when the highest valuator is as, or less, aggressive than other bidders. Optimal shilling can be as practical to implement as reserves, because it does not require sellers to have any information beyond that needed in a reserve auction.</p><p>If sellers shill optimally, they can never be worse off compared to using a reserve, and can be better off. Shilling can make bidders worse off, but can also make them better off when the seller using a shilling strategy optimally accepts bids below the optimal reserve. In these latter cases, shilling Pareto dominates reserves, ex ante.</p><p>We provide numerical examples to illustrate these results. We discuss how our results might be affected if shilling is not covert, or bidders' valuations have a common value component rather than being independent, or by the rules used in many discrete bid Internet auctions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of an auction seller's most important decisions is setting the lowest acceptable price at which to sell the property. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Sellers often choose from two alternative methods to enforce this price. They can set an irrevocable reserve before the auction, and bid publicly "on behalf of the reserve" by raising lower bids, thereby rejecting them. This reserve can be public, or known only to the seller. Or, sellers can shill covertly, which is usually considered disreputable. Here the seller publicly claims to use a reserve, but actually rejects bona fide bids by raising them during the auction while covertly posing as a bona fide bidder <ref type="bibr">(Cassady 1967, pp. 168-69, 174, 212-14;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">, Smith 1989</ref>, and bidders do not anticipate or detect this. We do not model, but do discuss later, bidders who suspect or can detect that sellers are shilling, and modify their bidding.</p><p>Optimal strategies for sellers and bidders depend on an auction's rules. One of the most popular auctions is the open English auction (OE), where bidders raise each others' bids until only one bidder is left. Most normative models of OE auctions have assumed rules of "continuous" bidding that permit any bid increase, no matter how tiny; in such models the bidders' optimal bid raise is usually just greater than zero (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McAfee and McMillan 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 707)</ref>, a result that affects sellers' optimal reserve and shilling strategies.</p><p>In actual practice, however, most OE auctions use rules that require bids to increase by at least a specified amount (see <ref type="bibr">Smith 1989, pp. 94-98)</ref>. These rules have existed for centuries <ref type="bibr">(Brough 1963, p. 26</ref>, provides an example from 1744), and courts have upheld their use <ref type="bibr">(Taylor v. Harnett,</ref><ref type="bibr">55 N.Y. Suppl. 988)</ref>. Many auctioneers specify these increments in advance, and they can be considerable. Christie's and Sotheby's catalogs specify increments of approximately 5% to 10% of the current bid. Most Internet auctions also use discrete bid rules (e.g., www.eBay.com). Although auctioneers typically have discretion to recognize smaller increases, few would accept anything near the "epsilon" 1 Sellers also should try to attract as many auction bidders as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bulow and</ref><ref type="bibr">Klemperer 1996, Engelbrecht-Wiggans 1987)</ref>. Our model does not cover situations where the number of bidders depends on the reserve. increases optimal in auction models that assume continuous bid rules.</p><p>Existing models of discrete bid auctions have also assumed that all remaining OE bidders seek to become the current bidder with equal aggressiveness. However, auction observers suggest that bidders often have different levels of aggressiveness. This can also affect sellers' optimal strategies. Continuous bid models have not studied aggressiveness because it does not affect their outcomes.</p><p>The present research identifies optimal reserve and covert shilling strategies for sellers in OE auctions with discrete bid rules and allows aggressiveness to vary among bidders. We study this for two reasons. First, whereas research on discrete bidding has examined such questions as optimal increments and allocation efficiency, assuming equal aggressiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harstad 1994b, Yamey 1972)</ref>, optimal reserve and shilling strategies in these auctions have not been examined, nor has the impact of varying aggressiveness. Investigating these issues can increase the realism of auction theory and bring it closer to actual practice and bidder behavior, an approach urged for auction research <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and Harstad 1994a)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we also provide useful qualitative insights for auction practitioners, especially sellers. These show that discrete bidding and aggressiveness often do change optimal reserve and shilling strategies compared to those with continuous bidding. We identify the nature of these changes and the auction contexts in which they occur. We also examine how directional changes in auction characteristics (such as the number of bidders, the increment, and aggressiveness) affect optimal strategies. This can help sellers adapt strategies to a particular auction.</p><p>We study these issues in the context of the independent private value (IPV) model of bidder valuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Harris and Raviv 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Myerson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Riley and Samuelson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Vickrey 1961</ref>, where bidders draw valuations from a common, continuous distribution. We find that optimal reserve and shilling strategies in these discrete bid auctions differ from those for continuous bidding as follows:</p><p>1. When the bidder with the highest valuation is relatively more (less) aggressive compared with all other remaining bidders as a whole, the seller's optimal reserve increases (decreases) past the optimal continuous reserve and increases (decreases) with the number of bidders. When this aggressiveness equals the other bidders', the optimal continuous and discrete reserves are equal.</p><p>2. The seller's expected utility with a reserve increases as this bidder becomes less aggressive, for any given number of bidders. This increases the set of auctions where discrete bidding produces higher expected seller utility than continuous bidding.</p><p>3. If the seller uses a covert shilling strategy, optimal reserve and shilling can differ:</p><p>a. If it is optimal to shill even once, the optimal lowest acceptable bid can differ from the optimal reserve, if this bidder's relative aggressiveness differs from others', and does not depend on where bona fide bidding stops or the number of bidders.</p><p>b. Sometimes the seller's optimal shilling strategy is to accept the highest bona fide bid and not submit even one shill bid. Whether to do so depends on the number of bidders, provided the highest valuator is relatively less, or equally aggressive, compared with others. c. Auctions exist where using shilling Paretodominates reserves. In other cases, shilling's disrepute for benefitting sellers at bidders' expense is justified. 2 With continuous bidding, shilling and reserves yield the same expected seller utility. The differences in 3a-3c do not occur in continuous bid auctions, where optimal shilling and reserve strategies yield the same lowest acceptable bid and the same expected utilities for seller and bidders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Graham et al. 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Shilling is illegal in many jurisdictions, but its existence has long been acknowledged and continues today. Our purpose is not to advocate it, but rather to study how optimal shilling depends on the discrete bid rules used in essentially all progressive auctions and on bidder aggressiveness.</p><p>Discrete bidding is such an entrenched auction practice that all participants usually must accept these rules and cannot employ them only when they benefit. Many Internet auctions also require discrete bidding, providing further evidence that these rules are widely accepted. Thus, this article addresses the scenario in which sellers must accept discrete bidding and determine their optimal reserve and shilling strategies accordingly. We do not seek to model a single motive for discrete bidding, nor claim that sellers use this practice only when it increases the seller's welfare. Several such motives have been proposed, and more than one may operate in any given auction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yamey (1972)</ref> shows that discrete bidding decreases the seller's OE auction utility in two auction outcomes, but increases it in another, compared with continuous bidding. The net impact on the seller's expected utility depends on these outcomes' relative probabilities. Bidders can prefer discrete bidding in the first two outcomes, which also decrease the winning bidder's expected payment, but this also lowers allocation efficiency. Discrete bidding also speeds up auctions, which saves bidders time and lowers their participation costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and Harstad 1994b)</ref>. The "epsilon" bid increases assumed by continuous bid models create very long auctions, of infinite duration if taken to the limit.</p><p>The auction models we present describe OE auctions with all bidders either present or bidding by telephone. They do not subsume all possible discrete bid rules or every issue that might arise with reserves or shilling. So many variants of OE rules exist in practice that no single model and set of assumptions can include them all. We discuss important limitations of our assumptions and suggest how departures might change our results, for example, when assuming bidders do not anticipate or detect shilling or in the case of Internet auctions. For reasons of space, we do not consider sellers who start shilling once their prior reserve price is met, such as might occur if a bidder's outright comments suggest a willingness to pay a higher price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Optimal Reserve with Discrete Bidding</head><p>The Seller. A risk-neutral or risk-averse seller desires to sell at an OE auction a single item that he or she values at v 0 , where v 0 Ն 0 and is private to the seller.</p><p>We assume either the seller holds the auction or pays an auctioneer a fixed fee. We do not examine auctioneers that receive a commission based on the sales price. Such commissions' implications are discussed later. The seller's auction profit, p S , is his auction revenue less v 0 . His utility function for this profit is U(p S ), where U(p S ) ‫ס‬ 0 for revenue v 0 . Only the seller knows U(•). We assume U(p S ) is linear or concave, strictly increasing in p S , and the seller seeks to maximize expected utility E[U(p S )]. The seller rejects any bid below v 0 .</p><p>The Reserve. We define the reserve, v D , as the lowest bid at which the seller will sell the property. We assume the seller sets v D irrevocably before the auction, announces to all bidders that a reserve is in effect, and can either keep its amount private or public. Reserves are typically considered ethical provided bidders are told a reserve exists. We assume if the property fails to sell the seller will not sell it in the near future, because this makes the reserve less credible.</p><p>The Bidders. We assume there are n bona fide bidders, with 2 Յ n Ͻ ϱ. The bidders need not know n, and we will examine whether the seller must know n to determine optimal reserve and shilling. Bidders draw valuations independently from the same continuous distribution, with c.d.f. F(v), p.d.f. f(v), and range <ref type="bibr">[v, v]</ref>. Only the ith bidder knows his or her v i . Thus, bidders have independent, private valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Myerson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Riley and Samuelson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Vickrey 1961</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We assume the seller knows F(v), but our results apply regardless of whether bidders do. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The v i 3 The IPV model has been extended to include bidders drawing valuations from different distributions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Myerson 1981</ref>). Our model does not cover such situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>We assume f(v)/(1 ‫מ‬ F(v)) is strictly increasing (Appendix Assumption 1). Assumption 1 holds in most auction models-otherwise they can yield the anti-intuitive results that the winning bidder's expected payment decreases as his valuation increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Myerson 1981)</ref>, which can imply that the seller's optimal strategy is to randomly choose a winning bidder <ref type="bibr">(McAfee and McMillan 1987, p. 708)</ref>. This assumption occurs in many other economics and industrial organization models <ref type="bibr">(Tirole 1988, p. 156)</ref>. Distributions meeting it include the uniform, normal, exponential, logistic, and any with increasing density. Certain log-normal, Weibull, and generalized gamma functions meet this assumption, whereas others do not.</p><p>are ordered v (1) Ͻ v (2) Ͻ . . . Ͻ v (n) , associated respectively with bidders B 1 , . . . , B n . Bidders can have any risk orientation, which can vary across bidders. We assume these bidders use their optimal bidding strategy, which in a continuous, OE auction with IPV valuations is to bid against competition and reserves up to their valuations, regardless of risk orientation, F(v), and whether they know F(v) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Vickrey 1961</ref>), or n or v D <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Riley and Samuelson 1981)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> This applies, also, to discrete auctions, where B i optimally bids up to and including the highest level not exceeding v (i ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harstad 1994b, Yamey 1972)</ref>.</p><p>Many auction models assume IPV bidders, including those addressing discrete bid auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and Harstad 1994b)</ref> and shilling with continuous bidding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Graham et al. 1990</ref>). However, no single model of bidder valuation always holds <ref type="bibr">(McAfee and McMillan 1987, p. 705)</ref>. The IPV assumption is appropriate when bidders form valuations independently of other bidders' information, and cannot increase their expected auction utility by changing v i as they observe bids. IPV bidders are not concerned with a "common value" component of property's value, determined by subsequent use or resale <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Capen et al. 1971</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Milgrom and Weber 1982</ref> on "affiliated value" auctions with both common and private value components). IPV valuations might occur for property bought only for personal use.</p><p>The Bidding Increment. We assume the auction rules require bidding to proceed using an exogenously determined, public, and constant increment I, where I k 0 to reflect the not inconsequential increments usually used in auction practice. Auctioneers usually "open" the auction with a bid s a , which is well below v D , and then will only recognize bids of s a ‫ם‬ kI, where k is a positive integer (see Definition 1 in the appendix). For expositional clarity we assume I is constant, but our results hold when I varies with the bid level in a manner made public in advance. This occurs in some 5 When bidders are risk-averse, first-price, continuous auctions produce higher expected revenue for the seller than OE auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Matthews 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Matthews , 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Riley and Samuelson 1981)</ref>. Because OE auctions are so popular, however, we examine OE results for risk-averse bidders, while acknowledging that in such cases sellers might want to consider a first price auction. actual auctions. Since varying I as bids increase can sometimes maximize E[U(p S )] <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and Harstad 1994b)</ref>, sellers might wish to set I endogenously. This may be difficult to implement, however, because in practice I is traditionally a round number such as $100 or $1,000.</p><p>We assume I Ͻ (v ‫מ‬ v 0 )/2. A very large I forces the seller to accept the first bid exceeding v 0 , since no v i is likely to exceed the next, much greater bid level. We also assume the current bidder will not raise his own bid, and that bidders do not raise bids by more than one increment. Although this latter "jump bidding" is not optimal for discrete bidders where f(v) is nonincreasing, we do not examine its optimality here (see <ref type="bibr">Rothkopf and Harstad 1994b, who</ref> show that jump bidding can be optimal when f(v) is increasing, in which case this decision can also depend on knowing n). Thus, bidding ends unless another bidder raises this bid or the seller bids on behalf of the reserve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bidding on Behalf of Reserve.</head><p>Let v D denote the seller's discrete reserve and the optimal reserve that v* D maximizes E[U(p S )]. If bona fide bidding stops below v D , we assume the auctioneer "bids for the reserve" by raising one increment. This is standard procedure in most reserve auctions. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Although bids below v D are typically recognized, they cannot buy the property.</p><p>We assume that once the current bid is v D ‫מ‬ 2I the auctioneer immediately bids v D ‫מ‬ I. This practice, known as keeping the bidding "in step" <ref type="bibr">(Cassady 1967, p. 153)</ref> or on the "right foot" (i.e., correct foot), is standard in many OE auctions and required to invoke the reserve. 7 Bidding Aggressiveness. A person's bidding aggressiveness describes the probability that he secures 6 E.g., rules in Christie's New York American Art sale No. 8886 on <ref type="bibr">May 21, 1998, under "Bidding," state, "</ref>The auctioneer may also execute bids on behalf of the consignor to protect the reserve . . . up to the amount of the reserve. . . . Under no circumstances will the auctioneer place any bid on behalf of the consignor at or above the reserve . . ." (p. 5). <ref type="bibr">7</ref> This ensures that bidders can purchase at v D . If a bidder raises to v D ‫מ‬I but no other bidder subsequently raises, the auctioneer must bid v D , which blocks the bidder from winning at v D . This violates the reserve. This is why the bidding rules in footnote 6 prohibit auctioneers from bidding at the reserve. If the reserve is alternatively the bid at the next level when bidding is below his optimal highest bid, and j other bidders also remain (1 Յ j Յ n ‫מ‬ 1). We refer to this probability as that person's "bid probability," denoted ဧ( j ). Aggressiveness does not affect any outcomes or utilities in continuous OE auctions, where bidders can raise the current bid by an infinitesimal, essentially costless amount, and so cannot gain or lose by holding, or not holding, the current bid. Aggressiveness does affect outcomes and utilities with discrete bidding, since raising a discrete bid increases the required payment by I, and any B i cannot raise a bid below v (i ) if the next discrete increment exceeds v (i) . Prior work on discrete bidding <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harstad 1994b, Yamey 1972)</ref> has assumed that all bidders have equal aggressiveness. This is certainly a reasonable starting assumption.</p><p>However, many auction writers observe that aggressiveness often varies across bidders, based on behavior such as the following: "whether to be bold or cautious in initial bidding" <ref type="bibr">(Cassady 1967, p. 147)</ref>; "When to jump in is up to [the bidder]. Neophytes often get in early, then fade. . . . It's probably better to wait . . . then pounce" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dobrzynski 1995)</ref>; "There are two schools of thought . . . aggressive and jumping in early <ref type="bibr">[versus]</ref> . . . the 'hang back and see what develops method'" <ref type="bibr">(Roberts 1986, pp. 41-42)</ref>. Auctioneers have also observed aggressiveness differences-"'There'll be ten bids the first few seconds . . . then it's usually down to two or three. Then some guy who sits in the background jumps in . . .'" <ref type="bibr">(Rubin 1972, pp. 28-29)</ref>.</p><p>Bidding aggressiveness may vary across IPV bidders for several reasons. Bidders may find the competition and public attention from aggressive bidding either enjoyable or stressful. Some bidders may not mind bidding unsuccessfully, whereas others may feel defeat. Some may flamboyantly attract the auctioneer's attention by calling bids loudly or waving their paddles, whereas others are timid. In each case the former bidder is more likely to obtain the current bid, all else equal. Because our model uses IPV bidders, we do not examine aggressiveness variations caused by common defined as one increment below the lowest acceptable bid, and thus the last point where the auctioneer bids on its behalf, must be v* D decreased one increment.</p><p>value factors, such as avoiding early bids to prevent revealing your interest to others.</p><p>Low bidder aggressiveness creates "sniping" in timed Internet auctions, where a new bidder waits until the last second to bid. Irritated comments on sniping often appear in online bulletin boards. Although the time limits of OE Internet auctions are not included in our model, the rise of sniping in these relatively new Internet auctions suggests that aggressiveness varies even in some new auction types.</p><p>We do not claim that aggressiveness always differs across bidders, but it often does, and this affects optimal reserve and shilling. If aggressiveness matters, sellers will want to obtain information that helps estimate aggressiveness differences. Although we could separately model each behavioral factor affecting aggressiveness, we feel that to obtain useful qualitative insights from a tractable model, it is more appropriate to discuss the several reasons aggressiveness may vary, as just done, and incorporate their influence in a single aggressiveness variable. We show that the seller's optimal strategies depend on the aggressiveness of B n , the bidder with the highest valuation, relative to that of the other remaining bidders collectively.</p><p>If all bidders strategically adjust aggressiveness to the level that most benefits them and if this is the same for all bidders, an equilibrium can arise where all bidders will be equally aggressive. Although some bidders may regard aggressiveness this way, we feel it is reasonable to assume that often one or more bidders do not and have certain bidding habits or personality characteristics that make their aggressiveness differ from that of other bidders. Consequently, we specify aggressiveness as an exogenous behavioral factor in the model rather than as a behavior that bidders adjust strategically. Our model examines all three situations where B n is relatively more aggressive, less aggressive, or equally aggressive compared with the other remaining bidders collectively.</p><p>Modeling B n 's Relative Aggressiveness. We assume neither the seller nor any bidder knows who is B n . Let ဧ( j ) represent the "bid probability" that B n obtains the current bid at s a ‫ם‬ kI when bidding against j other remaining bidders who also have v i Ն s a ‫ם‬ kI, where 1 Յ j Յ n ‫מ‬ 1. Note that ဧ( j ) includes both the probability that B n does not obtain the bid at s a ‫ם‬ kI, and that B n holds the bid at s a ‫ם‬ (k ‫מ‬ 1) I and so does not bid. We define that ဧ(•) depends on j, and assume that it does not depend on n (note that bidders need not know n). If B n has "neutral" relative aggressiveness, defined as equalling the average aggressiveness of these j remaining bidders, then ဧ( j ) ‫ס‬ [1/( j ‫ם‬ 1)].</p><p>We define that ဧ( j ) strictly increases with B n 's relative aggressiveness for any given j. We also assume that ဧ( j ) cannot be constant for all j (this eliminates ဧ( j ) ‫ס‬ 0 or 1 anywhere in j). A constant ဧ( j ) implies that B n 's chances of obtaining the current bid do not depend on how many bidders compete against him at s a ‫ם‬ kI, which is counterintuitive. Even the most aggressive possible B n has at most ဧ( j ) just less than 0.5, since he must be the underbidder at at least every other level (except immediately after an auctioneer's "right foot" bid, in which case ဧ( j ) could be just below 1).</p><p>We represent B n 's relative aggressiveness as ဧ( j ) given her actual aggressiveness minus ဧ( j ) given neutral aggressiveness, defined as v( j ) ‫ס‬ ဧ( j ) ‫מ‬ (1/( j ‫ם‬ 1)). To allow a succinct yet general exposition, the proofs focus on the variable n, which is the minimum of v( j ) for aggressiveness (thus, v( j ) Ͼ 0) or the maximum of v( j ) for unaggressiveness, (thus, v( j ) Ͻ 0) for j ‫ס‬ 1, 2,. . . , n ‫מ‬ 1. n ‫ס‬ 0 represents a B n with "neutral" relative aggressiveness (as assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rothkopf and</ref><ref type="bibr">Harstad 1994b, Yamey 1972)</ref>, n Ͼ 0 a relatively aggressive B n , and n Ͻ 0 a relatively unaggressive B n . Note that ဧ(•) is a function of j, while n can be either dependent or independent of n. To accommodate a wide range of aggressiveness behavior, we do not impose any particular functional form on the relationship between ဧ(•) and j or between n and n, and allow n to be either independent or dependent on n. We sometimes refer to B n 's relative aggressiveness as "aggressiveness."</p><p>We do assume that as j changes, a given bidder must always stay relatively aggressive, or unaggressive, or neutral, and cannot "switch" among these three categories. Our model is not intended to cover switching bidders. They do not have any consistent aggressiveness, and a more complex form of ဧ( j ) is required to accommodate their switches. Formally, then, for each bidder, ဧ( j ) ‫מ‬ (1/( j ‫ם‬ 1)) is always either equal to zero, or less than zero, or greater than zero, for all j and n.</p><p>We translate this behavioral condition into the sufficient model condition on ဧ( j ) that ( j ‫ם‬ 1)ဧ( j ) must be nondecreasing (nonincreasing) in j for aggressive (unaggressive) bidders.

Raising v D has four possible, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive consequences: The property (a) sells at the same price Ն v with both reserves, (b) does not sell with either, (c) sells for v ‫מ‬ I when v D ‫ס‬ v ‫מ‬ I, and sells for v when v D ‫ס‬ v, and (d) sells for v ‫מ‬ I when v D ‫ס‬ v ‫מ‬ I but does not sell when v D ‫ס‬ v.</p><p>In (a) and (b), raising v D does not change E[U(p S )].

This suggests that one explanation for the popularity of sizeable bid increments among sellers, beyond their more basic, operational ability to eliminate small, time-consuming raises, could be that many sellers may perceive (whether correctly or not) that B n tends to be relatively unaggressive.</p><p>Contrast with Continuous Bidding.

However, with discrete bidding, when n Ͼ (Ͻ)0, the right-hand side ratio increases (decreases) unboundedly with n, even if I is very small (see proofs of Propositions 1a-1c in the technical appendix).

A shilling seller accepts a bid when he stops raising and lets the item sell. Shilling is traditionally regarded as an unethical attempt by sellers to raise prices at bidders' expense. That shilling is a long-established practice, and continues today, is supported by comments from auction observers <ref type="bibr">(Cassady 1967, pp</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hewett 1994)</ref>. Shilling is also a problem in Internet auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schwartz 1998)</ref>. In January 1999, eBay, a popular Internet auction firm, announced new rules to combat shilling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anders 1999)</ref>. Subsequent investigations in the press, prompted by the suspicious sale of a highpriced painting, revealed the existence of Internet "shill rings" that were extremely difficult for most bidders to detect and that flourished despite the new rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dobrzynski 2000a</ref>). These revelations soon motivated the FBI to start a formal investigation of online shilling <ref type="bibr">(Dobrzynski 2000b)</ref>, and shortly afterwards, allegations of further shilling activities, this time in coin auctions, appeared in the press <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Simpson 2000)</ref>. Prosecutions of shilling are rare, however, suggesting much shilling remains undetected. As one observer comments, shilling "is not as common as many auction cynics would assert but more common than most auction houses would admit" <ref type="bibr">(Smith 1989, p. 150)</ref>.</p><p>Only a few auction models have examined shilling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al.

However, optimal shilling strategy for sellers has not been examined in the context of discrete bid, OE auctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumptions of the Shilling Model</head><p>We modify the reserve model as follows:</p><p>The Seller. A seller using a covert shilling strategy is ready to reject bona fide bids by submitting covert shill bids, even if he eventually makes no shill bids. We assume the seller announces falsely that a private reserve is in effect and does not expect that bidders can detect shilling. We assume sellers who "buy back" their property while shilling will not reoffer it in the near future, since this can signal bidders that shilling occurred (also assumed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al. 1990</ref>). While we refer to the seller's shilling decisions, we assume the seller can use a covert agent(s) to shill, and that any auctioneer cooperates with the seller's shilling strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bona Fide Bidders' Optimal Bidding Strategy.</head><p>We examine covert shilling, where bidders believe a reserve is in effect, do not anticipate or detect shilling, and perceive shill bids as bona fide. Thus, bidders use the same bidding strategy as with reserves-to bid up to and including the highest level not exceeding their v i . Because this strategy does not depend on n in an OE auction, it does not change with the addition of an apparent extra bidder(s) if shilling occurs.</p><p>We feel it is important to examine covert, rather than overt, shilling because we believe the former is more prevalent in actual auctions. Shilling is extremely difficult for bidders to detect. Although many auction bidders may be aware that shilling sometimes occurs, this does not necessarily imply that they believe shilling is occurring at the present auction, or can detect it, or attempt to adjust their bidding strategies accordingly. Furthermore, discussions of shilling in legal references and evidence from legal cases make clear that laws exist to protect bidders from shills precisely because it is a practice carried out in secret, and that often bidders do not detect shilling while bidding in auctions where later they found out it had occurred. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> From a consumer protection perspective, bidders who do not detect or anticipate shilling are consumers legally entitled to trust the (in fact) false claims of shilling sellers or auctioneers that all bidders are bona fide. Thus, examining covert shilling allows us to assess shilling's full potential to injure consumer welfare, whereas examining overt or anticipated shilling cannot.</p><p>We could assume bidders always believe shilling may occur and modify their bidding accordingly. This creates an information symmetry with some appealthe seller may shill, the bidder knows this and acts accordingly, the seller knows that the bidder knows, etc. We are faced with a choice between assuming that in actual auctions most bidders expect and can detect shilling, or that in such auctions most bidders do not anticipate or detect shilling, as supported by legal evidence. We feel the latter occurs more frequently, making it a useful starting point for examining shilling. At the same time, we acknowledge that the former "savvy" bidders may exist, and even unsavvy bidders may detect clumsy shilling. Our model is not intended to cover these situations, some of which are examined in the discussion section.</p><p>To justify the assumption that bidders cannot detect shilling, our model requires that (1) shills must bid in a manner consistent with optimal bidding behavior for bona fide bidders in a reserve auction, and (2) the manner in which bona fide bidders' bids are recognized as the current bid, or rejected, must be outwardly identical to a reserve auction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8</head><p>Legal references supporting that lawmakers and courts assume shilling can be kept secret include "[the shill] is secured from risk [of paying] by a secret understanding with the seller"; "the secret employment, by the seller, of a puffer or by-bidder" (C.J.S. 1980, Sect. 7-15); "such secret arrangements are offensive to fair dealing" (Burdon v. Seitz, 267 S.W. 219). Legal references supporting that lawmakers and courts assume bona fide bidders do not anticipate or detect shilling include "Mr. Sowa [the bidder] says he was not aware, at the time [of the auction], that an agent of the owner was bidding against him" (Stormy Weathers Inc. v. FDIC, 834 F. Supp. 519, p. 521); "At that time [soon after the auction] he [the buyer] knew nothing of the fraud which had been perpetrated upon him" (Edmunds v. Gwynn, 161 S.E. 892).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Seller's Decisions With Shilling</head><p>We assume the seller or auctioneer allows bidding to proceed among bona fide bidders, without shilling, until no further raises occur. Instead of selling the property or bidding for the reserve, however, the auctioneer in a shilling auction covertly signals to any shill(s) that now they may start shilling. This should not arouse bidder suspicion, since auctioneers in reserve auctions often exchange confidential signals with secretive bidders. Moreover, in almost all OE auctions the auctioneer takes a few seconds to determine whether bidding is finished by searching for lastsecond bids. Thus, our shilling model does not require auctioneers to take any public actions or make any judgments that they would not make in a reserve auction.</p><p>Covert shilling also cannot allow shills to "steal" bona fide bids by quickly calling out the same bid just made by a bona fide bidder and obtaining the current bid. This is possible because most auction rules give auctioneers authority to determine the current bidder. However, deliberate attempts to ignore bona fide bidders are likely eventually to trigger shilling suspicions. For the same reason, we do not consider the wellknown "backup" practice where, if a shill bid is not followed by a bona fide raise, the auctioneer announces a "mistake" in recognizing an apparent bidder and declares that the previous, bona fide bidder still has the bid <ref type="bibr">(Smith 1989, p. 151)</ref>.</p><p>Let the random variable S 0 denote the bid where bona fide bidding stops, with realized value s 0 . We assume s 0 Ն v 0 , since the seller rejects bids below v 0 . Once bidding stops the seller must decide whether to sell the property for s 0 , or reject s 0 by entering the first shill bid, of s 0 ‫ם‬ I <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Graham et al. 1990</ref> also assume shilling begins at this point). The first shill "fails" if no bona fide bidder raises it to s 0 ‫ם‬ 2I, so the property does not sell and U(p S ) ‫ס‬ 0. The first shill "succeeds" if a bona fide bidder raises to s 0 ‫ם‬ 2I. Here, the seller must decide whether to stop shilling and accept that bid or shill again by bidding s 0 ‫ם‬ 3I. The process repeats until either a shill fails or the seller stops shilling. We define the "terminal shill" as the last shill bid, made at a level denoted s t (s t Ն s 0 ‫ם‬ I), so the seller accepts bona fide bid s t ‫ם‬ I, if offered. To maximize E[U(p S )|s 0 ], which is conditional on S 0 ‫ס‬ s 0 , the seller using a shilling strategy must decide (i) whether to shill even once when bona fide bidding stops, and (ii) if so, finding the optimal terminal shill, termed .</p><p>s* t The previous discussion assumes that shills raise bona fide bids by only one increment. For completeness, the technical appendix examines the more general case where shills can raise by one or more increments consecutively. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> However, since we show (proofs of Propositions 3a-3c in technical appendix) that optimal shilling does not depend on whether intermediate shill bids occur singly or successively, for brevity the text examines shills that raise bids by one increment, which reflects bidding in most auctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Seller's Expected Utility from Ending Shilling at s t , Given s 0</head><p>The probability that ending shilling at s t "succeeds" is the product of the probabilities of three events that must all occur: (i) v (n) is the only v i (here using v i as a generic valuation) in the bidding increment it occupies; (ii) the first shill succeeds, conditional on (i); (iii) any subsequent shills needed to reach s t all succeed, conditional on (ii). The seller can calculate these probabilities from additional information on each bidder's v i that he obtains only from observing s 0 (and cannot use in a reserve auction) as follows:</p><p>i) v (n) is the only v i in its increment. This probability is denoted P(v (n),only |s 0 ). Bidding can stop at s 0 due to any one of three exhaustive, mutually exclusive outcomes (enumerated in the technical appendix Equations (A1a)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">A1c</ref>)). First, v (n) Ն s 0 ‫ם‬ I and at least one other bidder has s 0 Յ v i Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I, but B n obtains the bid at s 0 . Second, only v (n) Ն s 0 , but at least one other bidder has s 0 ‫מ‬ I Յ v i Ͻ s 0 and one such bidder obtains the bid at s 0 ‫מ‬ I, forcing B n to bid s 0 . Third, v (n) and at least v (n‫)1מ‬ share the same increment. The shill can possibly succeed in the first two cases, which happen if and only if v (n) is the only v i in its increment, but certainly fails in the third, because v (n) Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9</head><p>To covertly place two or more successive shill bids requires using two shills, who raise each other's bids in quick succession as often as necessary (they must prearrange who bids first). This allows each shill to raise by only one interval, which bona fide bidders will perceive as other bona fide bidders bidding quickly, which can occur in actual auctions.</p><p>Once s 0 is known, the seller can compute each outcome's probability, conditional on S 0 ‫ס‬ s 0 , and compute P(v (n),only |s 0 ) as the ratio of the sum of the first two probabilities to that of all three. Only the first two probabilities depend on B n 's relative aggressiveness (technical appendix Equations ( <ref type="formula">A2a</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">A2c</ref>)). By observing s 0 , sellers know that at least one bidder has v i Ն s 0 , at least one other bidder (the previous current bidder) has s 0 ‫מ‬ I Յ v i Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I, and the n ‫מ‬ 2 other bidders have v Յ v i Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I.</p><p>In continuous bid auctions, P(v (n),only | s 0 ) ‫ס‬ 1 always; B n can always raise any bona fide bid since v (n) Ͼ v (n‫)1מ‬ strictly. However, with discrete bidding P(v (n),only | s 0 ) Ͻ 1 always (see technical appendix Lemma 6b), because the probability that v (n) and at least v (n‫)1מ‬ are in the same increment, which can prevent B n from placing the last bid, is strictly positive always. If the first shill succeeds, however, on all subsequent shills it is certain only B n remains bidding.</p><p>ii) The probability the first shill succeeds if v (n),only occurs. Equations (A17)-(A19) in the technical appendix derive this probability, denoted P(v (n) Ն s 0 ‫ם‬ 2I|v (n),only ). This depends on v (n‫)1מ‬ , since the distribution of v (n) has lower support at v (n‫)1מ‬ . However, the seller does not know v (n‫)1מ‬ when deciding whether to begin shilling, but knows only that s 0 ‫מ‬ I Յ v (n‫)1מ‬ Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I. If the first shill succeeds, the seller knows for certain that v (n) Ն s 0 ‫ם‬ 2I, so v (n‫)1מ‬ 's value is no longer relevant to v (n) 's value.</p><p>iii) The probability the second through last shills succeed if the first succeeds. If s j is the most recent successful shill bid, where j Ն 1, the seller knows v (n) Ն s j ‫ם‬ I. Thus, after each successful shill the seller revises the c.d.f. of v (n) as F(v) truncated on the left at s j ‫ם‬ I and normalized to a probability of 1. Thus, the probability a subsequent shill bid of s k ‫ס‬ s j ‫ם‬ 2I succeeds, conditional on the previous shill succeeding, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(v (n) Ն s k ‫ם‬ I|v (n) Ն s j ‫ם‬ I), which is (1 ‫מ‬ F(s k ‫ם‬ I))/(1 ‫מ‬ F(s j ‫ם‬ I)).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimal Shilling Strategy. E[U(p S )|s 0 ]</head><p>, the expected utility from ending shilling at s t , given s 0 , can be expressed using the three probabilities in (i) through (iii), as in the appendix (under sketch of proof of Proposition 3). The seller maximizes E[U(p S )|s 0 ], subject to the constraint that it must exceed U(p S ) from accepting s 0 (see Equations ( <ref type="formula">A21</ref>)-(A22) in the technical appendix). This leads to two propositions that together define optimal shilling. Proposition 3 describes optimal shilling if it is optimal to shill at least once, and Proposition 4 identifies cases where sellers using a shilling strategy should not shill even once, but instead accept s 0 . Proposition 3a shows that if optimally the seller shills at least once, optimal shilling can use any sequence of shill bids provided the last is , so the lowest s* t acceptable bid is , regardless of the order of in-s*‫ם‬ I t termediate shill bids. 10 Proposition 3b implies sellers can determine before the auction, and even without s* t knowing n, since s 0 , n, and B n 's aggressiveness do not affect . An interesting question given shilling's rep-s* t utation as a method to increase prices is whether the minimum acceptable bid with shilling always exceeds that with reserves. Proposition 3c shows that, provided the seller shills at least once, the minimum acceptable the bid at by submitting a single shill bid at s 0 ‫ם‬ I and alternating s* t single bids with B n . If k is even, the seller is on the "wrong" shilling foot because this gives B n the bid at . To covertly get on the "right" s* t shilling foot requires that two confederates shill in quick succession, as in footnote 9. bid is not consistently higher or lower than . This v* D occurs because increases with n, and can either in-v* D crease or decrease with n (as per Propositions 1a and 1b). Proposition 3c also shows that as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s* ‫ם‬ I ‫ס‬ v* t C</formula><p>long as the latter is a permissible bid, so that the lowest optimal discrete bid the seller accepts, provided he shills, is the same as the optimal continuous reserve.</p><p>Next, we examine when sellers should not shill even once.</p><p>Proposition 4. When the seller uses a shilling strategy, and B n is relatively less, or as aggressive, than other bidders, discrete bid auctions exist where the seller optimally should not shill even once but instead accept s 0 . These scenarios depend on s 0 , n, and n.</p><p>Proposition 4 shows that in some auctions U(p S ) from accepting s 0 exceeds E[U(p S )|s 0 ] when shilling to , so the seller should not shill even once. These auc-s* t tions can occur when B n is relatively less aggressive, or as aggressive, than the other bidders. They occur because when n Յ 0 and n increases, P(v (n),only |s 0 ) monotonically decreases to a lower bound greater than zero, which lowers the probability that the first shill succeeds. This lowers E[U(p S )] from shilling to . At s* t some sufficiently large n, the seller's certain utility from accepting s 0 exceeds E[U(p S )|s 0 ] from shilling to . Note that when n Ͼ 0, P(v (n),only |s 0 ) is not monotonic s* t w.r.t. n, so Proposition 4 does not address this case. Propositions 3 and 4 together imply that the optimal lowest acceptable bid with shilling, however, is either s 0 or , and never a bid between them. s* ‫ם‬ I t Contrast with Continuous Bid Auctions. By contrast, in continuous bid auctions (i.e., the case of homogeneous distribution bidders in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al. 1990</ref>), the seller should always shill to the same optimal stopping point provided it exceeds s 0 , and this point does not depend on n or s 0 . The discrete and continuous results differ because once s 0 is known, the seller in the continuous auction knows v (n‫)1מ‬ , the lower support of v (n) , and that P(v (n),only |s 0 ) ‫ס‬ 1, which also implies that B n has the current bid <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Graham et al. 1990</ref>), regardless of s 0 or n. However, at this point the seller in the discrete auction still does not know v (n‫)1מ‬ with certainty, but does know that P(v (n),only |s 0 ) Ͻ 1. Both of these terms' values depend on s 0 , n, and n, which in some cases make the seller worse off if he shills even once. If the first shill succeeds, however, the discrete bid seller knows the lower support of v (n) with certainty and that only B n remains. Thus, in discrete auctions the decision whether to shill even once depends upon s 0 , n, and aggressiveness, but does not.</p><p>s* t</p><p>Comparing Information and Implementation Demands of Shilling and Reserves. Propositions 3 and 4 imply that optimal shilling does not require discrete bid sellers to have information beyond that needed to set optimal reserves, except observing s 0 , which they must also do in a reserve auction to declare bidding ended. Sellers in both auctions must know n, F(v), v 0 , and n. This means shilling is not more demanding than reserves from an information perspective.</p><p>Optimal shilling is also reasonably practical to implement for the following reasons. Before the auction the seller can calculate and determine, for each pos-s* t sible s 0 , whether it is optimal to shill to or accept s 0 .</p><p>s* t The seller can summarize these decisions into a fairly simple "shilling schedule," and give it to any shilling confederates before the auction. These need only state for the entire auction and, for each possible s 0 , s* t whether to shill to or accept s 0 . Neither the seller nor s* t confederates need make any complicated decisions or calculations under time pressure during the auction, which would reduce shilling's practicality. Thus, our results do not preclude that shilling represents a reasonably practical strategy for sellers to implement at many actual auctions. As mentioned earlier, our shilling model does not reflect all possible factors that may arise in auctions, which may create additional information or implementation demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Impact of Reserves and Shilling on Seller's and Bidders' Welfare</head><p>Given shilling's disrepute as benefitting sellers at bidders' expense, it is useful to examine how it affects both parties' expected auction utility compared with using reserves:</p><p>Proposition 5. In a discrete bid, open English auction: a) Optimal shilling always gives the seller an expected utility either (i) higher or (ii) the same as with the optimal reserve. The latter occurs only if , and if op-s* ‫ם‬ I ‫ס‬ v* t D timally the seller shills for every possible s 0 Ͻ . s* t b) Auctions exist where bidders earn higher expected utility when the seller shills optimally rather than using the optimal reserve. In these, shilling Pareto dominates reserves, ex ante. Such auctions occur when, for some n, (i) s* ‫ם‬ t , which can occur in auctions where B n is relatively I Ͻ v* D aggressive (n Ͼ 0), or <ref type="bibr">(ii)</ref> and the seller does s* ‫ם‬ I ‫ס‬ v* t D not shill for at least one s 0 Ͻ , which Proposition 4 posits s* t can occur for an unaggressive or neutral B n (n Յ 0). When shilling is not Pareto dominant, bidders are as well off, or worse off, than with a reserve.</p><p>Proposition 5a holds because shilling sellers can observe s 0 before determining the lowest acceptable bid. This information is not available before the auction, when the reserve is set, but can increase E[U(p S )]. IPV bidders in OE auctions do not change their highest optimal bid when observing bidding, however <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Harris and Raviv 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Myerson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Riley and Samuelson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Vickrey 1961</ref>. Because shilling does not constrain which bids sellers can accept or reject, compared with reserves, and sellers can change actions upon observing s 0 but bidders will not, this information cannot make sellers worse off, by Blackwell's Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blackwell 1951</ref> Whereas shilling can make bidders worse off compared to reserves, Proposition 5b also shows that auctions exist where it makes bidders better off, in which case shilling Pareto dominates reserves. These occur when the shilling seller accepts some bids below v* D (but exceeding v 0 ), as in Proposition 5b, i, and ii. If the seller shills, these bids are at least but still less s* ‫ם‬ I t than . This can be optimal when B n Ͼ 0, since inv* D creased aggressiveness causes to increase and to in-v* D crease with n (but remains unchanged). If the seller s* t decides not to shill, which we show can occur when n Յ 0 (while not ruling this out when n Ͼ 0), these bids are s 0 Ͻ (Proposition 5bii). In both cases, the win-v* D ning bidder's expected payment is lowered if the property sells, compared with reserves. Here, shilling also lowers the probability the property does not sell, which gives all bidders zero surplus. These factors together make bidders better off. Meanwhile, because in all such auctions the shilling seller accepts bids lower than , the seller is better off (by Proposition 5a).</p><p>v* D Contrast with Continuous Bid Auctions. With continuous bidding, by contrast, shilling and reserves always yield the same welfare for bidders and sellers, since both yield the same optimal lowest acceptable bid (i.e., a homogeneous bidder distribution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Graham et al. 1990)</ref>. That shilling can increase E[U(p S )] will tend to increase its attraction to sellers in discrete bid auctions. 11</p></div>

The returns from using the optimal shilling strategy are more substantial than for reserves. For shilling, there is no simple and obvious "null" model analogous to setting v D ‫ס‬ v 0 . However, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> does show that shilling optimally can increase E[U(p S )] substantially, be this to shill or accept s 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We have shown that discrete bid rules and variations in relative bidder aggressiveness that can occur with discrete bidding substantially alter sellers' optimal reserve and shilling strategies compared with continuous bidding. Furthermore, the decision of whether to use a reserve or shill and the level of B n 's relative aggressiveness can have a large impact on E[U(p S )] with discrete bidding. Auction practitioners, particularly sellers, can use the models we propose to gain insights into the nature of these strategy and utility changes, to predict when they occur, and determine how optimal strategies change directionally with other auction factors. Although sellers sometimes may have difficulty estimating all of these factors, such as aggressiveness, our results indicate that they do need to be concerned about aggressiveness and try to gather relevant information.</p><p>Relaxing the Covert Shilling Assumption. Before the auction, all bidders could believe the seller might shill, definitely will shill, or could have varying beliefs. During the auction even trusting bidders might detect clumsy shilling. Bidders suspicious of shilling might refuse to attend auctions where they believe it might occur, or attend but cease bidding if they detect shilling, or reduce their maximum bid to below its "trusting" level. As a last resort, they might try to estimate and immediately bid that amount if shilling is ops* t timal in an attempt to save one increment in the final price since the seller will not bid . s* ‫ם‬ I t However, bidders will encounter informational and welfare obstacles to implementing these responses to shilling, which reduces their usefulness. First, refusing to attend, or ceasing bidding, denies them the chance to earn a positive expected auction surplus, instead of zero. Second, shilling sometimes makes bidders better off, and bidders cannot determine this for a particular auction without knowing the seller's v 0 and utility function, which affect and whether the seller shills s* t or accepts s 0 . Yet bidders typically do not have either information, and their prior beliefs about it may be in error. The number of bidders also affects their optimal response, since bidders are better off in many shilling auctions when n increases beyond a point, and the seller should not shill. Third, bidders who suspect shilling can reduce their bids, whereas bidders with no such suspicions will not. Here, the suspicious bidders risk reducing bids excessively, and consequently los-ing to bona fide bidders rather than shills, while they still would have earned positive surplus with a higher bid.</p><p>Occasionally, a shilling seller can obtain information on bidders' valuations from indiscreet bidder behavior unrelated to bid amounts (such as telling a companion "I really want that teacup-I own the matching saucer"). The possibility of shilling implies that in auctions where covert shilling allows sellers (but not bidders) to gain, bidders have an extra incentive to keep their valuations private and not inadvertently to signal valuation information with indiscreet behavior. Neither our model nor any model that assumes bidders' valuations are private covers such behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auctions with a Common Value Component.</head><p>Our reserve model does not apply to discrete bid auctions where bidders have common or "affiliated" bidder valuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Milgrom and Weber 1982)</ref>. For such bidders, but not for IPV bidders, optimal continuous reserves can depend on n (see also <ref type="bibr">McAfee and McMillan 1987, p. 722)</ref>. We expect that optimal shilling in such auctions will also differ from our IPV results. Covert shill bids will tend to increase these bidders' valuations, which increase as others bid higher. This can make bidders worse off. Sellers in such auctions may be more likely to shill if they observe that some peoples' bids depend on what others are bidding, which reveals them as common value bidders. On the other hand, cases may still arise when sellers accept s 0 and do not shill, which makes the bidders better off with shilling than reserves. Consequently, the overall impact of discrete bidding on optimal reserve and shilling strategies, and participants' welfare, when valuations have a common value component, is not immediately clear.</p><p>Bid Probability that Depends on n. Our model assumes B n 's bid probability ဧ(•) depends only on j, the number of other remaining bidders, and not on n, the number of bidders participating at the auction's beginning. Furthermore, our model assumes, as do most models with IPV bidders, that bidders need not know n. It is possible that some bidders' ဧ(•) might depend on n as well as j. For example, in a crowded auction room B n might become more aggressive, or intimidated and less aggressive. Our model does not cover this situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Auctioneer's Cooperation and Commission.</head><p>Auctioneers can volunteer different levels of cooperation with shilling, such as forgiving or collecting commissions on property bought with shill bids, or stopping auctions if they detect shilling. Shilling becomes less profitable to sellers as this cooperation decreases. However, even the most cooperative auctioneer's optimal shilling strategy might differ from the seller's if the auctioneer receives a commission only for sold property. In this case the auctioneer's optimal reserve may differ from the seller's and is likely to be less. Thus, for both reserves and shilling, future research may wish to examine equilibria as sellers and commission auctioneers negotiate strategies in discrete bid auctions.</p><p>Internet Auctions. Our model's assumptions must be modified to reflect rules and practices peculiar to Internet auctions. Many such services display e-mail addresses for all bidders and report how many times each bids. After bidding closes each bidder's maximum bid is often displayed. To shill covertly and not be detected afterwards, an Internet seller needs a larger set of confederates to submit shill bids from various e-mail addresses. Shills who regularly submit bids within seconds of each other, to obtain the correct shilling "foot," could also be revealed by this public information. Thus, a model of covert Internet shilling could not allow this practice. However, we do not expect that changing the model to reflect Internet bidding would change our model's basic results regarding the optimal point at which to stop shilling, whether to shill, the impact of aggressiveness, and the impact on sellers' and bidders' welfare. Internet bidders can also choose to be extremely aggressive by allowing the Internet service to automatically raise bids up to a specified maximum, an option available in many live auctions.</p><p>Internet auctions usually indicate that the current bid is below the reserve rather than having an electronic auctioneer raise bids. However, our model's basic results for discrete reserves should still apply to such Internet auctions, especially the dependence on aggressiveness and n.</p><p>Internet auction increments, typically between 1% and 5% of a current bid, are smaller than in most live auctions. One explanation is that because most Internet auctions take several days and participants can bid at any time, smaller increments do not increase bidders' time costs as they would in live auctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothkopf and Harstad 1994b)</ref>. Furthermore, many Internet auctions feature standardized items available in large quantities, such as baseball cards, toys, or coins. These usually trade within small price ranges, requiring smaller increments to make a market (just as stock shares have for years traded with very small increments of $1/32, which is 0.0625% of the price of a $50 share). By contrast, articles in Internet art auctions are often unique and trade over a much larger price range, and many such auctions do use larger increments. Further research may examine how uncertainty or fluctuation in objects' values affect the increments used in auctions that sell them. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>characterized as follows (see the technical appendix for proofs of propositions):</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="7">Proposition 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition and Properties of ဧ(•)</head><p>Here, we define ဧ(•) formally, based on the discussion of bidding aggressiveness in the text ( §2). The "bid probability" is the probability that B n obtains the current bid when j other bidders also remain. The bid probability for B n is denoted by ဧ( j )| Aggressive , or ဧ( j )| Neutral , or ဧ( j )| Unaggressive , depending on whether B n is relatively aggressive, neutral, or unaggressive. Note that ဧ(•) is a function of j and some other parameter. The latter directly represents aggressiveness in any functional form appropriate for ဧ(•).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>The authors would like to thank Sushil Bikhchandani, Donald G. Morrison, Ambar G. Rao, Rahul Roy and Tirthankar Roy for comments on earlier versions of this paper, and extend their gratitude to three anonymous Marketing Science reviewers and the Area Editor for many useful suggestions and criticisms. Both authors contributed equally to this paper.</p><p>We require that ဧ(•) satisfy the following three properties: (a) For any given j, ဧ( j )| Aggressive Ͼ ဧ( j )| Neutral Ͼ ဧ( j )| Unaggressive , with the inequalities being strict; and that ဧ( j ) strictly increases with aggressiveness, regardless of the type of aggressiveness. Note ဧ( j )| Neutral ‫ס‬ 1/( j ‫ם‬ 1). (b) ( j ‫ם‬ 1)ဧ( j ) is nondecreasing in j for an aggressive B n , nonincreasing in j for an unaggressive B n , and constant in j for a neutral B n , for all j corresponding to all n. This sufficient condition ensures that for each bidder, ဧ( j ) ‫מ‬ 1/( j ‫)1ם‬ is always either Ͼ 0, or Ͻ 0, or ‫ס‬ 0, for all j. Also, note that different bidders are allowed to have different types of aggressiveness. (c) ဧ( j ) is not a constant in j for aggressiveness, neutrality, or unaggressiveness, for all j. It follows from properties (a) and (c) that ဧ( j ) is a monotonic function of the parameter directly representing aggressiveness, for a given j. For example, c is that parameter in the numerical examples in the text's §5. Because the proofs do not require that parameter explicitly, it does not appear as an argument in ဧ(•).</p><p>Property (a) follows from the definition that higher aggressiveness increases B n 's bid probability, ဧ( j ), ceteris paribus. The justification for property (c) has been discussed in the text ( §2). Property (b) ensures that B n has consistent aggressiveness, and does not "switch" from one type of aggressiveness to another as j changes. The technical appendix contains the proof that violating property (b) contradicts property (a). Please note that property (b) implies that our model does not describe auctions where individual bidders' aggressiveness can "switch."</p><p>Next, we state all lemmas together for ease of reference when reading the proofs. Lemma 1. (n F n‫1מ‬ (v)/(F n (v) ‫מ‬ F n (v ‫מ‬ I)) strictly increases as n increases and is unbounded.</p><p>Lemma 2. (n F n‫1מ‬ (v ‫מ‬ I))/(F n (v) ‫מ‬ F n (v ‫מ‬ I)) strictly decreases as n increases and has a minimum Ͼ 0.</p><p>and is not necessarily monotonic if n Ͼ 0.

The proof of Lemma 3 compares how the numerator and the denominator change with v. The proof of Lemma 4 uses the definition of absolute risk aversion (from Pratt 1964, Theorem 1).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SINHA AND GREENLEAF The Impact of Discrete Bidding and Bidder Aggressiveness</head><p>Marketing Science/Vol. <ref type="table">19, No. 3, Summer 2000  263</ref> Lemma 5 is true. As noted in footnote 4, this assumption is satisfied by several distributions and has been widely used in the literature. For Lemma 6a, we first enumerate the probabilities of the three mutually exclusive and exhaustive ways that bidding can stop at s 0 . This allows us to derive the expression for P(v (n),only |s 0 ) for each of the three kinds of aggressiveness. The proof then examines separate subcases for each kind of dependence between n and n and for each kind of aggressiveness. The proof also requires that the three properties of ဧ, as discussed earlier, hold. The proof of Lemma 6b shows that each of the three possible outcomes always has a strictly positive chance of occurring. Sketch of Proof of Proposition 1. We show exists and is v* D unique because the gain and loss functions from raising the reserve, which are q and r in text Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2), always cross, and at only one point, over the range of the reserve. To prove the remainder of Proposition 1a-c, we start with a relatively aggressive B n , so that n Ͼ 0. To show that increases with n, we must examine separate v* D subcases where n is nondecreasing in n versus strictly increasing in n. We then show for each subcase that as n increases, q and r can remain equal only if the reserve is eventually increased by a bidding increment and that as n continues to increase, eventually reaches v* D v‫מ‬ I. We do this by isolating the impact of n on the equality q ‫ס‬ r, and show that when n Ͼ 0 and n is increased, the least upper bound at which q ‫ס‬ r is v‫מ‬ I. We use parallel reasoning to show that if B n is relatively unaggressive (n Ͻ 0), then decreases with n down v* D to v 0 .</p><p>To show that increases with v 0 , we show that the gain q is v* D strictly monotonically increasing, and the loss r is strictly monotonically decreasing, w.r.t. v 0 . Consequently the reserve when q ‫ס‬ r will increase with v 0 . To show that increases with B n 's relative agv* D gressiveness for a given n, we use the fact that the gain q increases with aggressiveness, whereas the loss r does not depend on aggressiveness. To show that approaches as I approaches 0 for all n, v* v* D C</p><p>we use real analysis and compare the result with as derived by v* C <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Matthews (1980)</ref>. To show that decreases as the seller becomes v* D more risk averse, but only for n Յ 0, we show how making the seller more risk averse lowers the reserve at which q ‫ס‬ r, provided n Յ 0.</p><p>Sketch of Proof of Proposition 2. To show that E[U(p S )] at increases as B n 's relative aggressiveness decreases, we first forv* D mulate E[U(p S )] in a discrete auction with a reserve. This has not been done in the extant literature. We show that a discrete bid auction with a reserve has three mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes:</p><p>(i) The item does not sell. This happens if and only if</p><p>with probability . This implies that p S ‫ס‬ 0.</p><p>(ii) The item can sell at , in three mutually exclusive and ex-v* D haustive ways:</p><p>(a) Only B n 's value is . With "correct foot" bidding for the Նv* D reserve, the item sells at . The probability of this event is:</p><p>(c) Only B n 's value is Ն ‫ם‬ I, and at least one of the (n ‫מ‬ 1) v* D remaining bidders has ‫ם‬ I, and B n has bid at .</p><p>The item sells for above the reserve because of competitive bidding. This happens in three ways for each bid level</p><p>where M is the number of possible bid levels above . v* D (a) Only B n 's value is Ն ‫ם‬ (k ‫ם‬ 1)I, and at least one of the v* D (n‫)1מ‬ remaining bidders has ‫ם‬ kI Յ v i Ͻ ‫ם‬ (k ‫ם‬ 1)I, and</p><p>, and at least one of the (n ‫מ‬ 1) v* ‫ם‬ kI D remaining bidders has , and</p><p>not have bid at , and so must bid . </p><p>We then show that only some of these outcomes have probabilities of occurring that depend on n. We differentiate these outcomes' probabilities w.r.t. n, and, after some rearrangement and simplification, get the result. Next, we show that decreasing n increases the set of possible auctions where E[U(p S )] is higher with discrete than continuous bidding for a given n. This depends on the argument that although E[U(p S )] does not depend on n in a continuous bid auction, it increases as n decreases when bidding is discrete. Sketch of Proof of Proposition 3. To show that the optimal final shill bid, , exists, we first derive the seller's expected utility s* t from submitting a specific set of shill bids, provided bidding stops at s 0 . To do so in the most general manner, we define a shill "run" as one or more shill bids placed consecutively by shill(s) without waiting for a response from bona fide bidders. Two shill runs must be separated by a bona fide bid. We then define a sequence of shill runs by s 1 , s 2 , . . . , where the discrete bid level at which the ith shill run ends is denoted s i (noting s i Ͻ v‫מ‬I). Thus, s i Ն s i‫1מ‬ ‫ם‬ 2I, i ‫ס‬ </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SINHA AND GREENLEAF</head><p>Using the properties of order statistics, we then estimate the probability that all of these shill bids will succeed. We also show that this probability does not depend on whether the intermediate shill bids are placed successively or separately. By inspection, we show that does not depend on s 0 , or n, or n. We show that increases with s* s* t t v 0 , and decreases as the seller becomes more risk averse, using real analysis and calculus. Next we show that ‫ם‬ I can be higher or s* t lower than , and that this depends on n and n. This proof combines v* D two results already proven-that does not depend on n or n, but s* t that does (shown in Proposition 1). This also allows us to show v* D that only when n ‫ס‬ 0 does for all n. The derivation of s* ‫ם‬ I ‫ס‬ v* t D</p><p>‫ם‬ I shows that it equals if the latter bid lies on a discrete bid s* v* t C level. Sketch of Proof of Proposition 4. We show that sometimes the seller's expected utility from shilling to , which is the optimal shill-s* t ing strategy shown in Proposition 3, is less than the seller earns for certain by accepting s 0 . The comparison between these two expected utilities depends on s 0 , because that is the certainty revenue the seller risks if he shills, and because P(v (n),only |s 0 ), which raises the chances that shilling to succeeds, depends on s 0 . It depends on n and n s* t because P(v (n),only |s 0 ) decreases with n, but only if n р 0.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 5a: Note that the information demands on the seller regarding n are the same in both the optimal shilling and reserve strategies. Compared with using a reserve, the shilling seller has more information when he sets the lowest acceptable bid because he knows s 0 , which he does not know when setting the reserve. This allows the shilling seller (ex-ante) to enumerate each bidder's valuation with lower variance, compared with F(v) used in a reserve auction. This happens because {S 0 ‫ס‬ s 0 } refines bidders' valuations to {s 0 Յ v (n) Յ v}, {s 0 ‫מ‬I Յ v (n‫)1מ‬ Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬ I}, and {v Յ {v (1) , . . . , v (n‫)2מ‬ } Ͻ s 0 ‫ם‬I}. Further, ex-ante, the set of possible decisions the seller can make-to accept or reject bids-is identical in both auctions. Also note that the bidders' ex-ante set of decisions is the same with both reserves and shilling (bidders don't change their bidding strategy during the auction, as stated in § 3). Hence, the seller can never be worse off by using the optimal shilling strategy compared with the optimal reserve strategy (appealing to Blackwell's Theorem on Comparison of Experiments 1951).</p><p>We now show that auctions exist where, ex-ante, the seller is strictly better off with the optimal shilling strategy than with the optimal reserve strategy. By Blackwell's Theorem, E[U(p S )] is strictly higher in the shilling auction when (i)</p><p>, or (ii)</p><p>and it is optimal for the seller to not shill for at least one I ‫ס‬ v* D (by Proposition 4 such auctions exist). In (i), shilling and s Ͻ s* 0 t reserve strategies yield different optimal lowest acceptable bids and hence different expected utilities for the seller. In (ii), optimal shilling is strictly dominating for the seller because the seller accepts at least one s 0 with shilling (based on more information) that he rejects with reserve, and he accepts that s 0 because the seller's expected utility is greater from accepting s 0 rather than shilling up to . Now, the s* t expected utility for the latter is the same as that from setting v ‫ס‬ sells in these auctions is strictly greater with shilling than with reserves. Also, ex-ante, each bona fide bidder's expected surplus is greater in such shilling auctions, because (i) with probability Ͼ 0, the property would sell at some bid in shilling auction, and (ii) . Using Proposition 4 and the arguments we have just stated I ‫ס‬ v* D in the proof of Proposition 5a, we conclude that auctions exist in which bidders are strictly better off (unless seller shills for all s Յ 0 in which case the bidders are as well off as in reserve auction). s*, t By Proposition 5a, the seller is at least as well off with shilling. Pareto dominance follows. Q. E. D.</p></div>			</div>
