<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The decision to enter an emerging market characterized by high demand potential and high risk is always intriguing: When to enter? Where to enter? How many stores to open? These are important decisions faced by international firms that are interested in expanding their businesses in emerging markets. In this paper, we study the entry and expansion decisions of McDonald's and KFC in China, especially how the two players have influenced each other.</p><p>Over the past two decades, these two major fastfood chain restaurants have flourished in the world's largest emerging market. Although most Chinese consumers in big cities are now familiar with the two American brands, the concept of Western fast food was novel when KFC opened its first outlet in Beijing in November 1987. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> By 2007, however, KFC had entered 240 cities with 2,000 outlets and McDonald's had entered approximately 140 cities with more than 1,000 outlets. In this fast expansion process, it is intriguing to ask how the presence of a rival affected each firm's strategies-specifically, decisions on whether to enter a new market or how many new outlets to open in an existing market.</p><p>On the one hand, KFC and McDonald's are considered direct competitors in the Western fast-food category in the China market. On the other hand, there could be positive spillover effects from the rival in this specific context. For example, although China, with its large population and remarkable economic growth, is an attractive market, it also presents substantial uncertainty to foreign companies. Therefore market learning through both one's own information and the information revealed from a rival's action could be important. In addition, traditional Chinese food is distinct from Western food, and it takes time for local consumers to accept typical Western food such as hamburgers. The presence of the rival chain could facilitate consumer learning of the new product and expand the potential demand that benefits all the firms in the same category.</p><p>We assembled original data on the entire entry and expansion history of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">KFC and</ref><ref type="bibr">McDonald's in China from 1987 to 2007</ref> through multiple sources. The data include the number of new outlets KFC and McDonald's opened each year in each city and the local characteristics of these cities. Our empirical analysis of chains' expansion decisions reveals that both McDonald's and KFC are more likely to increase the number of outlets in a city where their rival has a larger scale of presence, controlling for city characteristics and own-chain effect. In other words, the rival's presence has a positive and significant effect that outweighs the competition effect in this setting.</p><p>The main objective of the paper is to empirically test which potential source is more likely to be the driving force of the positive rival effect in this context, and we focus on two potential sources: (1) market learning (i.e., the entry behavior of a rival may reveal valuable information about the market size and growth rate that a firm can utilize in its subsequent decisions) and (2) demand expansion (i.e., the existence of a rival chain may help to cultivate consumers' taste for Western-style fast food and expand the potential demand). We develop a theoretical framework about a chain's optimal expansion decision that predicts that a chain would react differently to the rival's expansion pattern depending on whether it infers information from the rival's actions or benefits from the rival's role in cultivating consumers. The empirical analysis based on these predictions suggests that the positive rival effect for KFC and McDonald's is likely to be driven by different sources. More specifically, we find that market learning is more likely to explain the positive effect that KFC exerts on McDonald's, and demand expansion is more likely to explain McDonald's positive spillover on KFC.</p><p>Although, in essence, our research is on firms' entry and expansion decisions, the uniqueness of the study lies in the context of decision making. First, it happens as the two U.S.-based firms are exploring a large emerging market, which requires substantial learning from the firm side. Second, firms' expansion history in this market is also a process that builds up a new industry category, which is considerably different from entry in a mature market or industry. The context of two global fast-food chain restaurants expanding in the world's largest emerging market simultaneously provides us with a unique opportunity to potentially identify the positive spillover effects in the course of firms' interactions.</p><p>Meanwhile, this study has important managerial implications for multinational firms that are interested in expanding their business in an emerging market. Previous research on emerging market entry has largely focused on the industry level. A large literature in the international economics field has studied the entry mode, performance, and impact of foreign direct investment on the emerging economy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borensztein et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Isobe et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Javorcik 2004</ref>). We take a more microlevel perspective by modeling firms' entry and expansion behavior based on individual firm decision making. We focus on the dynamic interactions between the entering firms in their exploration of the emerging market, an area that still awaits more rigorous studies. Our research shows that the competing firms may well be "companions" when expanding in an emerging market with significantly different market environments and consumer preference.</p><p>Our work is closely related to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Toivanen and Waterson (2005)</ref>, who, using McDonald's and Burger King's store-opening data in the United Kingdom between 1991 and 1995, find that a rival's presence increases the probability of entry. This finding reverses the prediction of the standard entry model, which holds that all else being equal, a firm will enter the market without a competitor if it can choose between two comparable markets. Toivanen and Waterson attribute the positive effect to learning; i.e., a firm learns the market size through its rival's presence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang (2013)</ref> further explores the role of learning in fast-food chain agglomerations by estimating a structural model of entry and exit decisions under common market uncertainty, using data from the fast-food industry in Canada. He finds that fastfood chains face significant uncertainty before entry and that learning from the incumbent chains is a key driver of fast-food clustering.</p><p>This paper also relates to the increasing empirical work on the (positive) spillover effects of entry. Using data on U.S. regional shopping centers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vitorino (2012)</ref> finds complementarity among certain types of department stores. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mariotti et al. (2010)</ref> study the role of information externalities and knowledge spillovers for the agglomerative behavior in location choices of multinational enterprises in Italy. In a study of Japanese multinational corporations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Henisz and Delios (2001)</ref> show that the prior entry decisions of other organizations in the same business group have a greater influence on firms that lack experience in the market. Our work contributes to this literature by identifying different types of positive spillover effects with entry in an emerging market.</p><p>Finally, this paper also adds to the literature on the fast-food industry in general. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sault et al. (2006)</ref> investigate within-market location decisions of McDonald's and Burger King in the United Kingdom and find that learning from competitors along with product differentiation can explain the observed location patterns of these two players. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Thomadsen (2007)</ref> looks at the two companies' location strategies in the U.S. market and finds that the equilibrium locations of the two fast-food players depend on the market size. Our research provides additional insights into how major fast-food chains make entry and expansion decisions in an emerging market. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates fast-food chains' entry decisions and the spillover effects in an emerging market.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss the industry background and the data in §2. In §3, we present a theoretical framework on entry and generate a set of testable hypotheses under each explanation of positive rival effect. In §4, we estimate a two-stage model that links a chain's initial entry and expansion decision and test which explanation is more likely to be the driving force of positive rival effect based on the hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework. We further discuss the variation of a rival's impact in §5 and conclude in §6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Development of KFC and</head><p>McDonald's in China The presence of Western fast food in China began in November 1987, when KFC opened its first outlet in Beijing. Following in KFC's footsteps, McDonald's (McD's) opened its first outlet in Shenzhen in October 1990. Thus the competition between KFC and McD's formally started in the world's largest emerging market. On a global scale, KFC and McD's are not competitors at the same level; McD's is far ahead of KFC in terms of its number of outlets. However, the picture is completely reversed in the China market.</p><p>By tracking KFC's entry path, we find that KFC typically enters the capital city of a province first and then expands to nearby cities. KFC chose China's capital city, Beijing, as the home of its first outlet and quickly spread to the east and south coast, which is economically more developed than the rest of China. Then KFC steadily expanded to the north, the central area, and the west. It now has a footprint in all the provinces in China except Tibet.</p><p>In contrast, McD's expansion has been relatively more conservative. McD's opened its first outlet in Shenzhen, a city in the Guangdong province that is next to Hong Kong, where McD's was headquartered at the time. In its first few years there, McD's limited its entry to only a few big cities and the cities in the southeastern part of China that are close to Shenzhen. It accelerated its expansion rate from 1999 but was dwarfed by its rival's even faster pace. By the end of 2007, McD's still had no presence in seven provinces, including Tibet.</p><p>During their 20 years of growth in China, the two chains not only expanded to dozens of new cities per year but also continuously increased the number of outlets in the cities they had already entered. Such expansion breadth and depth has contributed to the fast increase in the total number of outlets for both chains. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts the diffusion of the number of cities entered by KFC and McD's. The pattern is close to the typical S-shaped diffusion, with the "takeoff"  occurring around 1999. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the cumulative number of outlets over time for each chain. Although more players have been appearing in China's fast-food market over time, we believe it is reasonable to exclude other fast-food firms in our analysis because none of them had a significant national impact by the end of our sample period. Other foreign fast-food brands entered China much later and have a much smaller presence. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In terms of the local Chinese fast-food industry, despite fast growth over the years, the scale of national Chinese fast-food chains is still small within the overall fastfood industry. Moreover, the competition between the Western fast-food chains and the local Chinese fast-food chains is much weaker than the competition between the two Western chains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data and Statistics</head><p>Our data track the opening year and location of each outlet of KFC and McD's at the city level from 1987 to the end of 2007. For each city, we know when KFC and/or McD's opened their first outlet and how many additional outlets were opened each year after initial entry. The data set was constructed from both publicly sourced and hand-collected information. We obtained the outlet lists including outlet names, telephone numbers, and addresses for both KFC and McD's through the companies' official websites and online restaurants' guide. Using a local marketing research company, we obtained each individual outlet's opening year information. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> To cross-check the accuracy of the information, we obtained outlet registration information from the Industry and Commercial Administration Bureau in a few cities that we have access to. The information from the two sources is highly consistent, which ensures the quality of the data. We also searched the milestones of the two fast-food chains in China through multiple sources and compared them with our data, e.g., the total number of outlets in China by year 2000. The results are again largely consistent. Our final data cover about 98% of the official total outlets for both KFC and McD's by 2007.</p><p>We collected city-level characteristics from volumes of the Chinese Cities Yearbook spanning 1989 to 2008. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The cities reported in the yearbooks vary in some years, but we are able to consistently identify 246 major cities across years. When merging the two data sets, we found that by the end of the sample period, 236 of the 246 cities witnessed the entry of at least one of the fast-food chains. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> For each of the 246 cities in the data, we observe the population size (in 10,000's), geographical area (in square kilometers), and gross domestic product (GDP, in 100 million yuan (RMB)) each year. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We also collected the longitude and latitude information for each city, which allows us to track the distance between each city and the firms' headquarters or any other city in the network. KFC has <ref type="bibr">3</ref> There is missing information for 39 KFC outlets and 24 McD's outlets. Since the missing data only account for a small percentage of the total number of outlets, and there is no special pattern for missing data, we exclude them from our formal analysis. The stores with missing information may include exits. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The information reported in each yearbook includes the statistics from the previous year. The early years of the city yearbook are only available in hardcopy, and we manually input the city characteristics information for those years. Also, we were not able to find the yearbook for 1988. Therefore, the formal analysis excludes the first entry of KFC in Beijing in 1987. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> There are 11 cities that KFC or McD's has entered, but we fail to match these cities with city characteristics. These are all small towns (not identified by the yearbook as a "city") that the chains entered recently, which are excluded from our analysis. Altogether, there are 18 KFC outlets and three McD's outlets in those 11 cities. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The yearly GDP figures are adjusted for inflation, all in 2005 RMB. The descriptive statistics of city characteristics are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. We further categorize the sample into big and small cities. Big cities include municipalities directly under the administration of the central government, special autonomous regions, the capital city of each province, the 14 coastal cities with an open economy, cities in special economic zones that enjoy more favorable policies for foreign investors, and other cities with a GDP over 20 billion RMB and population over 2 million. These cities are economically more developed or have special economic and political status, which account for 25.3% of the sample, with the rest categorized as small cities. The descriptive statistics of sample breakdown for big and small cities are summarized in the middle part of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. The data reveal that, on average, big cities are more densely populated and economically better developed, although big cities are not necessarily larger geographically. The bottom part of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> breaks down the sample to the pre-1999 and post-1999 eras. The year 1999 seems to be the takeoff year for both KFC and McD's, when the two chains started to speed up their expansion in China. A notable difference for the two sample periods is the substantial increase in GDP after 1999.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> summarizes the descriptive statistics of the number of new outlets opened each year in each city by KFC and McD's by different sample breakdowns. On average, KFC adds 0.39 new outlets per year per city, with a much higher number in big cities and during the second period <ref type="bibr">(1999)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref>. A similar pattern is observed for McD's but on a smaller scale. Moreover, KFC has more experience (more years of operation) than McD's, on average, across cities. It is also evident that chains enter big cities earlier than the small cities, on average. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> indicates the total number of cities entered for each chain and the cumulative number of outlets by the end of the sample period. Before 1999, both KFC and McD's entered about three new cities and added about two dozen new outlets nationally each year on average. Both chains expand much faster after 1999. During this period, McD's entered roughly 13 new markets each year, adding 90 new outlets per year. KFC on average entered 20 new cities and opened 187 new outlets each year. For both chains, the practice of franchising is very limited in the China market in our sample period. 7 Note. Population in 10,000; area in square kilometers; GDP in 100 million RMB; and distance to headquarters in kilometers.</p><p>Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the histograms of the total number of outlets by city at the end of the sample period for the two chains. The long tail of the histogram reflects the significant heterogeneity across markets. Among the 246 cities in our data set, KFC is the first mover in 187 cities and McD's is the first mover in 33 cities. Among the 33 cities where McD's took the initiative and entered before KFC, 20 are small cities. There are 16 cities that KFC and McD's entered in the same year; they are all small cities.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Framework</head><p>We start with a simple model that captures the key considerations in firms' expansion decision. We assume that the decision of how many new outlets to open depends on the revenue and cost associated with the additions. First, firm i's (expected) revenue (R it ) from its stores is formulated as 8</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R it = n it + S it M e i X t H it H jt − a 1 n it + a 2 S it − b 1 n jt + b 2 S jt (1)</formula><p>where n it is the number of new outlets to be opened in period t and S it is the stock of outlets that chain i owns at the beginning of period t in the market. If the number is 0, it means the firm has not entered the market yet. The terms in square brackets can be interpreted as the average revenue per outlet, which depends on the following: (1) the expected market size for chain i, M e i ;</p><p>(2) the cannibalization of outlets from the same chain, including the existing stores before period t and the newly opened stores, with a 1 ≥ 0 and a 2 ≥ 0; and (3) the competition effect from the rival chain, b 1 ≥ 0 and b 2 ≥ 0. We use M e i to denote firm i's (subjective) evaluation of the market size or demand at period t, which is a function of the market characteristics, X t , and firm i's and the rival's past behaviors, summarized by H it and H jt , respectively. We assume that H it and H jt can positively affect demand evaluation; we discuss the mechanisms below.</p><p>Second, the total cost of maintaining the existing outlets and opening new ones is modeled as a linear function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C it = K it • 1 S it = 0 + S it + V e it n it (2)</formula><p>where 1 S it = 0 is an indicator function that has a value 1 if the firm has not entered the market before time t yet and 0 otherwise. Therefore K it is the initial entry cost, which could change over time with, for example, the expansion of the chain's network. The second term is the operating cost of the existing outlets. The third term captures the opening and operating costs of new outlets, which could depend on the experience of chain i in the market, denoted by e it . Firm i's decision problem is to choose the optimal number of outlets to open (n * it to maximize the profit conditional on her expectation on the rival's decision:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">n * it = arg max n it R it − C it (3)</formula><p>To simplify the problem, we assume that firm i uses the rival's new outlets opened in the last period (n jt−1 ) to form her expectation of n jt . The first-order condition of the profit maximization problem satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">• = M e i X t H it H jt − a 1 n it +a 2 S it − b 1 n jt−1 +b 2 S jt −a 1 n it +S it − V n it = 0 (4)</formula><p>It suggests that the optimal number of new outlets would be such that the marginal revenue of a new store (in square brackets) equals the marginal "cost," which includes both the cannibalization effect and marginal store opening cost (the last two terms). We are particularly interested in how the rival's presence, as summarized by S jt , would affect firm i's entry and expansion decision. Using the implicit function theorem, one can show that sgn n * it / S jt = sgn M e i / S jt − b 2 under some mild assumptions. It suggests that the net rival effect depends on the magnitude of the positive rival effect on the expected size of demand relative to the competition effect.</p><p>We specify the expected market size (M e i ) as a function of market characteristics X t , a firm's own past expansion summarized by M e o H it , and the rival's impact denoted by M e r H jt :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M e i X t H it H jt = X t + M e o H it + M e r H jt<label>(5)</label></formula><p>One's own presence in a city may positively affect demand through consumer learning or brand loyalty.</p><p>The presence of the rival may also have a positive effect for the following reasons: (1) the existence of the rival chain may cultivate local consumers' taste for the Western-style fast food, which expands the potential demand for the new product and benefits the focal chain (demand expansion effect); 9 and (2) the existence and expansion of the rival may signal the size and growth of the market (market learning effect).</p><p>Although there might be other sources of the positive rival effect, we focus on these two leading explanations that have appeared in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Caplin and</ref><ref type="bibr">Leahy 1998, Toivanen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Waterson 2005)</ref>. We now look at each explanation in greater detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demand Expansion</head><p>Traditional Chinese food is distinct from Western food, and it takes time for local consumers who are used to oriental food to accept typical Western food such as hamburgers. The entry of the rival chain may help to cultivate local Chinese consumers' taste and facilitate consumer learning of the new product. We assume that both the scale of the Western fast-food chains and the time they have been in existence would matter in cultivating consumers' taste for Western fast food. Long-existing outlets (those outlets opened earlier) would have a stronger cumulative effect in consumer taste cultivation relative to the stores added more recently. 10 This implies the following: (1) A larger scale of rival presence suggests a higher degree of cultivation.</p><p>(2) The time span since the rival's store opening has a positive effect on cultivating consumers' taste.</p><p>(3) There is a positive interaction effect of the scale and length of outlets' existence. (4) The sequence of store opening matters. Conditional on the total number of outlets, more outlets opened in earlier years may convert to a higher stock of cultivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Market Learning</head><p>Another plausible explanation for why a rival's past actions may affect a firm's evaluation of market size is market learning or information externality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Caplin and Leahy 1998)</ref>. When a multinational company enters a foreign market, an effective way of reducing uncertainties or information asymmetries is via observing competitors' past entry decisions in the same market. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Learning may continue in the expansion stage after initial entry given the dynamics and uncertainty inherent in emerging markets. A firm's evaluation on market size could be decomposed into the assessment of the existing demand and the expectation of market growth. The rival's entry behavior may reveal information about both components. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The scale of a rival's presence (S jt ) can signal the size of the current market. A firm may <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Put more formally, one can formulate the degree of customer cultivation by the rival chain as jt = r t−1 s=1 t − s n js , where n js is the number of outlets that chain j opened in period s. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For empirical research of observational learning on the consumer side, see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cai et al. (2009)</ref> and Zhang (2010). <ref type="bibr">12</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yang (2013)</ref> structurally models the Bayesian learning mechanism in the context of fast-food chains' entry into the Canadian market. Although we are not explicit about the learning process, the idea is consistent with a Bayesian learning model that firms revise the expected market size upwardly given the entry of the rival.</p><p>further learn about demand growth from how fast its rival grows. We use the rival's average expansion rate (S jt /e jt ) to capture the first-order rival's growth. Furthermore, we use the rival's net growth rate in the past L periods, which can be defined as g jl = n j t−l − n j t−l−1 (l = 1 2 L), to capture the second-order rival's growth. If a rival's faster growth signals faster demand growth, it suggests that (1) conditional on the total number of a rival's outlets (S jt ), a higher average expansion rate (larger S jt /e jt ) signals higher demand growth-that is, the same scale of a rival's expansion happening within a shorter time span suggests stronger demand growth; or (2) a rival's positive net growth (g jl &gt; 0) suggests faster demand growth-that is, the accelerating trend of a rival's expansion implies faster demand growth.</p><p>Because both the demand expansion effect and the market learning effect may contribute to a positive rival effect, we specify the following general function of M e r that can allow us to test which mechanism is more likely to explain the data pattern:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M e r H jt = 1 S jt + 2 e jt + 3 S jt e jt + L l=1 l g jl (6)</formula><p>which includes the rival's stock of outlets, the rival's experience, the interaction effect between the two, and the lags of net growth (with L representing the number of lags to be used).</p><p>Conditional on the existence of a rival's positive spillover effect, we expect 1 &gt; 0 for either circumstance of demand expansion or market learning. However, the signs of the rest of the parameters in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) vary depending on which explanation is the driving force of the positive effect. For demand expansion, both longer experience and a larger scale of presence from the rival contribute to a higher stock of cultivation, and there is a positive interaction effect between experience and the scale of presence, so we expect 2 ≥ 0 and 3 ≥ 0. Furthermore, the sequence of store openings with more outlets opened in the earlier stage and fewer new outlets in the later stage contributes to a higher level of cultivation compared with the reverse sequence, i.e., fewer outlets opened in the early stage and more additions in the later stage. In other words, conditional on the same total number of outlets, a descending sequence of new store openings or negative net growth converts to a higher degree of consumer learning, all else being equal. Hence we expect l ≤ 0.</p><p>For market learning, the predictions would be different. If a firm uses the growth pattern of the rival chain to predict demand growth, then positive net growth (g jl ) would imply faster demand growth. Therefore, one would expect l ≥ 0. In addition, conditional on the (positive) effect of a rival's stock (S jt ), the interaction of a rival's stock and a rival's experience Marketing Science 33(2), pp. 287-307, © 2014 INFORMS is likely to be negative; that is, 3 ≤ 0. In other words, quicker expansion or achieving the same scale of expansion in a relatively shorter period of time suggests higher demand growth. We also conjecture that ≤ 0 conditional on S jt . In summary, although both explanations of a rival's positive impact yield the prediction that 1 &gt; 0, the predicted signs of other parameters in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) diverge, which provides us with a set of testable hypotheses as to which effect is more likely to be the driving force when the rival's impact on a chain's entry decision is positive, summarized as follows:</p><p>• If demand expansion is the driving force of the rival's positive impact, conditional on the positive effect of a rival's stock of outlets, the rival's experience is likely to be positive (i.e., 2 &gt; 0), and the interaction of a rival's experience and a rival's stock is likely to be positive (i.e., 3 &gt; 0). In addition, the chain is more likely to expand in a city where the rival has decelerated (negative) net growth, all else being equal (i.e., l &lt; 0).</p><p>• If market learning is the driving force of the rival's positive impact, conditional on the positive effect of a rival's stock of outlets, the rival's experience is likely to be negative (i.e., 2 &lt; 0), and the interaction of a rival's experience and a rival's stock is likely to be negative (i.e., 3 &lt; 0). In addition, the chain is more likely to expand in a city where the rival has accelerated (positive) net growth, all else being equal (i.e., l &gt; 0).</p></div>

The empirical distribution of the cumulative number of a chain's outlets is highly skewed. Therefore, we use the log transformation of the stock of outlets in the estimation. The sign of o1 captures the net effect of a chain's own stock on further expansion. We also control for its own experience in the market (e imt ), which is defined as the number of years since chain i made initial entry into city m. Longer experience may benefit additional entry through operating efficiency, for example. Yet such an effect may diminish over time. Therefore, we also include an interaction term of the chain's own local experience and time. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> (2) To measure the rival's impact, we control for the rival's outlets opened in the last period (n jmt−1 ); the rival's stock of outlets, which is again taken log transformation (S jmt ), 16 the rival's experience in the city (e jmt ); and the interaction between the rival's stock and rival's experience. In addition, we control for the rival's net growth rate in the last three years with g jml = n jm t−l − n jm t−1−l . As discussed earlier, although the rival's outlets can steal business from the focal chain, they may have a positive effect on the expected demand. If the net effect from the rival is positive ( r1 &gt; 0), the sign of the parameters r2 , r3 , and l r6 can help us to differentiate whether demand expansion or market learning is more likely to explain the positive rival effect. This set of parameters is the main interest of our analysis. We further control for the interaction of the rival's stock and the focal chain's own experience as well as the rival's experience and time, allowing the rival's impact to change with the chain's own local and national market experience.</p><p>The last term, v im , captures the time-invariant unobserved factor that affects firm i's expansion decision in market m, where is the standard deviation of the unobserved factor and v im follows standard normal distribution. This term introduces unobserved heterogeneity into the expected mean of the number of new outlets across cities.</p><p>Note that a chain's expansion in a given city is conditional on entering the city first. We model the initial entry decision into a city as the following binary choice:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y * imt = Z imt + imt (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">y imt = 1 if y * imt &gt; 0 (9)</formula><p>where y * imt is the latent variable that represents firm i's propensity to enter market m at period t, and the observed counterpart y imt is 1 when y * imt exceeds the threshold (0). Once firm i had the initial presence in city m at period , we observe the firm's expansion decision n imt for each period t &gt; . <ref type="bibr">17</ref> In the above equation, Z imt is a vector of observed variables that affect a chain's initial entry decision. We include the distance between city m and the chain's headquarters, the distance between the focal city and the chain's closest existing market (pre-entered city), as well as the number of firm i's pre-entered cities in the same province at t to capture chain i's initial entry cost in city m at period t. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The distance measures are log-transformed because of the skewed distribution of these variables. We also control for the stock of the rival's outlets at the beginning of period t (S jmt ), city characteristics, as well as two important policy implementations during the data period that may affect the chains' market entry decision. In late 1992, the State Council issued a notice ("open policy") to further open up 5 cities along the Yangtze River and the capital cities of 11 inland provinces, supporting these cities in attracting foreign investment. Furthermore, in 2000, the central government announced a new policy ("promote-west" policy) on the large-scale development of the western region with the objective to speed up the economic development of the undeveloped inland, which includes 11 provinces and 1 municipality in our data set. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We introduce two <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The initial entry equation is similar to a selection equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Heckman's (1979)</ref> sample selection model. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Another measure of entry cost is the distance to the nearest distribution center. Information on distribution centers is not available from the two chains' official websites. We therefore searched the establishment of KFC or McD's distribution centers from news archives. The results show that distribution centers were typically established after a chain has entered the region. For example, KFC's Beijing distribution center was reportedly constructed in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alestron 2004</ref>). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> A brief introduction of the policies can be found on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Economic_Zones_of_the_ dummy variables to capture the two policy implementations, where a policy dummy is set to 1 for the affected cities during the policy years and 0 otherwise.</p><p>The error term imt captures the unobserved factors that affect a firm's initial entry decision. We further decompose the term into two components: imt = u im + imt , where u im is the unobserved time-invariant market and chain-specific effect that follows normal distribution (u im ∼ N 0 2 u ), and imt is the random error that follows i.i.d. standard normal distribution. Therefore, the initial entry decision is characterized by a random effects probit model. The existence of u im suggests that imt error terms are correlated within the city m.</p><p>The initial entry and expansion decisions by firm i in city m are potentially correlated. Therefore, we assume that u im and v im jointly follow bivariate normal distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">u im v im ∼ N 2 0 0 2 u u u 1 (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where is the parameter that captures the correlation of the two decision stages. Furthermore, the conditional distribution of v im can be denoted as f v im u im = N / u u im 1 − 2 . Hence, v im can be expressed as a function of u im with v im = / u u im + 1 − 2 im , where im ∼ N 0 1 . Let W imt denote all the observed explanatory variables in Equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>); then, conditional on the initial entry occurred at period , the expected number of new outlets opened in market m at t can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E n imt W Z = E exp W imt + u u im + 1− 2 im u im &gt; − Z im + im and u im &lt; min 1≤l&lt; − Z iml + iml (11)</formula><p>The expansion decision is conditional on the initial entry the chain made at period (and not the periods before ). Estimating the Poisson model without accounting for the initial entry condition would lead to sample selection bias. The expectations are taken over the distributions of u im , im , and imt . Since the full information maximum likelihood approach is computationally burdensome with multiple integrals, 20 following Terza (1998), we estimate the model using a two-step estimation procedure. The idea can be traced back to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Heckman (1979)</ref>.

Although the simple Heckman-type correction method that applies to linear models does not directly apply to nonlinear models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Orme and Peters (2001)</ref> show that one can use polynomials of Heckmantype correction variables as an approximation in the second-stage estimation for count model. We extend the correction method proposed by Orme and Peters on cross-sectional count models to panel count data, noting that the unobserved time-invariant factor u im is not only bounded below as u im &gt; − Z im + im but also bounded above as u im &lt; min 1≤l&lt; − Z iml + iml . The latter condition comes from the fact that initial entry threshold was not met prior to period . Letting L im = − Z im + im / u and U im = min 1≤l&lt; − Z iml + iml / u , the first-order correction term can be expressed as 21</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">im = L im − U im U im − L im • f L im f U im d L im d U im (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where • and • represent the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Endogeneity</head><p>An important issue to discuss before proceeding to estimate Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is endogeneity. Notice that by controlling for im in this stage, we correct for the sample selection bias, i.e., the timing that a chain expands in a city (accumulates own experience) is not random. However, there is still concern about the endogeneity of other variables. Specifically, a rival's stock of outlets S jmt could be an endogenous variable if there exist some unobserved market-specific factors such as the taste for a certain type of food that may affect both the focal and rival chains. In addition, the stock of a chain's own outlets S imt is also potentially endogenous. For example, an unobserved chainspecific effect can affect a chain's past expansion as well as its current decision.</p><p>We address the issue by using the control function approach, which involves two steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wooldridge 2002)</ref>. The first step involves ordinary least square regression of the endogenous variables on the exogenous and instrument variables. In the second step, we run the equation of interest with both the original endogenous variables and the first-stage residuals as additional variables. In essence, the second step uses the first-step residuals as a proxy for the unobserved variables to address the omitted variable issue and restore the consistency of the parameter estimates. Notice that the second step is different from the usual two-stage least square estimation that replaces the endogenous variables with their first-stage predicted values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Terza et al. (2008)</ref> show that the two-stage least square method that addresses endogeneity in linear models may produce inconsistent estimates in nonlinear models such as count data models, whereas the control function approach as described above is consistent.</p><p>We run the following instrumental variables (IV) regression of the endogenous variables S jmt (j ∈ KFC McD s ) in the first step:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S jmt = Z 1jmt 1 + V jmt 2 + jmt (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where Z 1jmt includes the exogenous variables in Z, and V jmt are the instrumental variables for S jmt . The instruments that we use are the distance between city m and the closest city that chain j has entered up to period t and the total number of outlets that chain j owns up to t within a radius of 100 kilometers outside the focal city m. These variables are picked as instruments because the distance to the chain's network and the entry decision in nearby regions could be correlated with a chain's expansion decision in the focal city. For example, chain j may be more likely to open outlets in city m when the city is surrounded by more existing markets and stores, as the marginal operation and management cost is lower. Yet the variables are unlikely to be correlated with the unobserved characteristics of city m. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The reduced-form errors jmt are independent of the explanatory variables in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">14</ref>) by construction. By the nature of panel data, jmt is decomposed into a time-invariant and a time-varying error, jmt =¯ jm + jmt . Both components can be recovered from within-panel least square regression. By including the estimated residuals¯ jm and jmt as additional regressors in the equation of interest, one corrects for the endogeneity of S jmt , which might be caused by either time-invariant or time-varying unobserved factors.</p><p>Note that the main equation of interest (Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)) involves two sets of endogenous variables: one is the rival's past expansion behavior in the focal city and the other is the focal chain's past expansion in the city. Therefore, we use two control functions to address the endogeneity concern: one focuses on the rival's stock of outlets S jmt and the other focuses on one's own stock of outlets S imt . We make an assumption that one control function suffices for each set of the endogenous variables. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> The idea is that both the rival's stock of outlets S jmt and other variables of a rival's expansion are potentially correlated with the same underlying factors. By controlling for the residuals from the control function on S jmt -namely,¯ jm and jmt -one captures both the time-invariant and timevarying unobserved factors that may lead to the endogeneity of the set of variables if left uncontrolled. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The residuals from the two IV regressions are controlled in the Poisson model of a chain's expansion decision to address the endogeneity concern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Empirical Results</head><p>The main results for KFC and McD's are summarized in Tables 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. In each table, the upper panel reports the results of a chains' expansion decision and the lower panel estimates the initial entry condition. First of all, we find evidence that a rival's presence has a positive effect on a chain's expansion decision in general. Second, we find that the positive effect seems to be driven by different the unobservables affecting entry in the nearby regions. First note that the province dummies capture the regional similarity to some extent. In addition, we performed the Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests for both the spatially lagged dependent variable and spatial error correlation based on the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Elhorst (2010)</ref>. In these tests, the dependent variable is the binary decision of whether to enter or to add additional outlets, and the control variables are the ones discussed above.

It is an empirical question as to which effect dominates in this setting. Thus, we first examine the net effect of rival's stock of outlets on a chain's expansion decision. In the upper panel of Tables 4(a) and 4(b), the first column reports the results before correcting for endogeneity. For both chains, the coefficient of a rival's  Notes.

The second column addresses the endogeneity issue using the control functions approach as discussed above. The standard error of the parameters is obtained using bootstrapping; residuals from the first-stage regressions are controlled as observed variables. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> In the IV regression of the rival's stock and a chain's own stock, the F -statistics are larger than the usual criterion of 10 (238.59 and 329.73, respectively), and the coefficients of the instrumental variables are highly significant, which lends support to the validity of the instruments.</p><p>Inspecting the coefficients of the included IV regression residuals, we find that for KFC, the rival's stock time-invariant residual is negative and significant, suggesting that the unobserved factor that encourages McD's past expansion could be negatively correlated with KFC's current expansion. Controlling for this factor leads to an increase of the coefficient in front of the rival's stock of outlets. In other words, one would significantly underestimate the positive effect of McD's stock of outlets on KFC's expansion decision  if not controlling for the endogeneity of this variable. For McD's, we find that the own-stock time-invariant residual is positive and significant, whereas the timevarying residual is negative and significant. It implies that the unobserved factor that affects McD's past expansion is positively correlated with the chain's current expansion decision, which could be, for example, the chain's local reputation. The time-varying residual has a negative impact, suggesting that expansion in the past negatively affects the decision at the current period, which may be due to the chain's resource constraints in the expansion process. 27 Notes.

Recall that if the focal chain benefits from its rival's impact on cultivating local consumers, it is more likely to expand in cities we have four residuals to add to the Poisson model of interest. However, we find that adding both time-varying residuals to the model causes a multicollinearity problem. Therefore, empirically we add the two time-invariant residuals to control for the timeinvariant unobserved factor of each chain and one time-varying residual to capture the changing unobserved factor. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In an unreported analysis, we estimated a basic specification of chains' expansion decision, which only includes city characteristics, own-chain effect, and the rival's stock of outlets; it excludes other variables currently in the model. In a variety of model specifications, such as adding other city characteristics (e.g., school age population and local wage for the years when data are <ref type="bibr">available, 1996-2007)</ref> and allowing for serial correlation in the error terms, we consistently find that the rival's stock of outlets has a positive effect on the focal chain's expansion decision. Results are available from the authors upon request.</p><p>where the rival has been existing longer with more outlets opened in the earlier years. In contrast, if the focal chain uses the growth of the rival chain to obtain information about market growth, then it is likely to add more outlets in cities where the rival expands more quickly with a positive net growth rate.</p><p>To test which explanation is more likely to drive the positive rival effect, we focus on the coefficients of the rival's experience, the interaction of the rival's experience and stock of outlets, and the rival's net growth rate in the last few periods. By comparing the results in Tables 4(a) and 4(b), we find that these coefficients are in the opposite direction for KFC versus McD's. For KFC, both McD's experience and the interaction of McD's stock with McD's experience are positive and significant, suggesting that KFC prefers markets with a longer presence of its rival. This is consistent with the demand expansion explanation. For McD's, by contrast, the interaction of KFC's stock and KFC's experience is significantly negative (conditional on the positive effect of the rivals' stock of outlets), indicating that McD's appreciates the markets where KFC opens more outlets in a shorter period of time. The coefficient of a rival's experience is also negative though insignificant after correcting for endogeneity. These results are in line with the market learning explanation.</p><p>Now look at the signs of the rival's lagged net growth rate. We find that the net growth of McD's has a negative effect on KFC's decision to expand. This suggests that KFC would open more outlets in a city where more McD's outlets were opened previously compared with a city where more outlets were recently added. A city with more rival outlets opened at an early stage has a higher stock of consumer cultivation than a city with fewer rival outlets in the beginning but more outlets newly added, conditional on the total number of a rival's stores. Hence the preference for the descending sequence of the rival's store expansion indicates that demand expansion is more likely to explain the positive effect of McD's presence on KFC.</p><p>In contrast, for McD's, we find that KFC's net growth in the last three periods has a positive and significant effect on its expansion decision. That is, everything else being equal, McD's is likely to add more outlets in a city where KFC continued to grow with a positive rate. This is consistent with the market learning explanation-that is, McD's is likely to use KFC's expansion as demand signals and revise its assessment on demand potential upwardly.</p><p>In summary, conditional on the positive effect of the rival's stock of outlets, we find that positive rival effect is likely to be driven by different underlying forces for KFC and McD's. The results are consistent with the explanation that the presence of KFC signals Marketing Science 33(2), pp. 287-307, © 2014 INFORMS market potential and growth to McD's, whereas the presence of McD's helps to cultivate consumer tastes that benefit KFC. The effect from a rival's stock of outlets and rival's experience tends to diminish as a chain's own local and global experience accumulates, which is reflected by the interaction terms of a rival's presence with the focal chain's own experience.</p><p>Finally, we briefly examine the role of a chain's own past expansion on one's current expansion decision. The coefficient of KFC's own stock of outlets tends to be positive, suggesting that the positive effect, such as customer learning and brand building from its own existing outlets, may outweigh the within-chain cannibalization effect. McD's tends to open more outlets in cities with longer local experience, which may be associated with lower operating cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Initial Entry Condition.</head><p>Estimating the initial entry condition helps us to infer the value of the unobserved factor u im , which is potentially correlated with the unobserved factor v im in the chain's expansion decision. The sign of the parameter in front of the correction term im in the expansion model indicates the direction of the correlation. The coefficient of im in both chains' expansion models is negative and significant, implying &lt; 0. That is, the unobserved factors in a chain's expansion decision are negatively correlated with the unobserved factors in the initial entry decision. This result may seem counterintuitive at first. Deeper inspection, however, reveals that those cities with less attractive observed city characteristics but that witnessed the entry of KFC or McD's have bigger unobserved factors recovered from the firststage estimation. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> In other words, if KFC or McD's entered an economically less developed city, it suggests that there exists some unobserved positive factor that triggers the chain's entry decision. On the other hand, for economically more developed cities with attractive observables, the initial entry threshold is easily satisfied, which identifies a small unobserved factor in that stage. Conditional on initial entry, the economically more developed cities experience faster chain expansion than average, whereas we may observe fewer additions of outlets in the less developed cities that KFC or McD's entered possibly for strategic reasons. Therefore, the unobserved factor in the expansion stage is small for economically less developed cities, and the opposite is true for the more developed cities. Taken together, one finds a negative correlation of unobserved factors across the two stages.</p><p>We now look at the estimates of the random effects probit model for the initial entry condition reported at the lower panel of each table. First, GDP has a significant and positive effect on chains' initial entry decisions. KFC is also more likely to enter densely populated cities, whereas density is not a significant predictor for McD's initial entry. For both chains, the number of pre-entered neighboring cities in the same province significantly increases a chain's probability of entering the focal city, suggesting the existence of the economies of density <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Holmes 2011)</ref>. The distance to a chain's headquarters and the closest pre-entered market have a negative effect on entry, but the effect is significant only for McD's. It suggests that McD's is more likely to enter a city that is closer to its existing network or headquarters. In addition, the implementation of the promote-west policy increases both chains' entry probability in the affected regions, since the coefficient in front of this policy dummy is significantly positive for both KFC and McD's.</p><p>For KFC, the rival's stock of outlets seems to have an insignificant effect on its initial entry decision. However, we need to be careful in interpreting the result, as the insignificance of McD's stock on KFC's initial entry is largely dictated by the fact that there are limited observations where McD's makes the initial entry ahead of KFC. On the other hand, McD's seems more likely to enter a city with a larger stock of KFC's. 30</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Discussion</head><p>The empirical analysis of KFC and McD's expansion in the Chinese market suggests that the rival's net impact is positive during the period of time under study. Based on the difference in the chains' reaction to their rival's expansion pattern, we may conclude that market learning or information externality is more likely to be the driving force of KFC's positive effect on McD's, and demand expansion can explain the positive effect of McD's on KFC.</p><p>This result may be rationalized by the unique characteristics of each chain. It is likely that McD's has a stronger effect on cultivating consumer taste because it is more symbolic of Western food than is KFC. KFC, however, may have a better understanding of local Chinese consumers. For example, the founding leadership team of KFC's Great China division is formed mainly by Chinese born in Taiwan-people who have a better knowledge of the Chinese culture and market than the leader team in McD's formed by nonlocals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Liu 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the current analysis, we also utilize supplemental data to test the proposed explanation.</p><p>One check concerns market learning. A better indicator of market profitability than the total number of a rival chain's outlets in a market would be direct sales revenue. If a chain is learning about local demand and potential, then it should be more likely to expand to markets with higher observed sales revenue from the rival. Although we do not have data on the sales of KFC or McD's at the city level, we were able to collect aggregate information on fast-food restaurants' sales revenue at the province level from 2002 to 2007. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> We then ran the analysis of a chain's expansion decision with the added variable of restaurant sales revenue and found it to be highly significant for McD's but not significant for KFC. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> Although the variable is a crude indication of category demand that includes both Chinese and Western fast food, the significance of sales revenue on McD's expansion is consistent with its learning about the propensity of local fastfood consumption.</p><p>However, we want to point out that there might be other explanations that can rationalize the observed data pattern, and our analysis does not rule out alternative explanations. We also want to acknowledge the weakness of and a few potential issues in our data analysis. First, the observed city characteristics are limited. Many of the statistics are not available at the city level for early years. Although we have controlled for the most important economic city characteristics, missing some of the additional local characteristics may lead to overestimation of positive rival effect.</p><p>Second, although we have carefully dealt with selection and endogeneity issues, these concerns may not be fully alleviated. There are multiple potentially endogenous variables in the second-stage estimation of a chain's expansion decision. To address the issue, we use two control functions to correct the endogeneity arising from the variables related to the rival's past expansion (e.g., the rival's stock of outlets and rival's experience) and the variables related to one's own past actions, respectively. A crucial assumption is that the endogeneity of the set of rival (own)-related variables is caused by the same source, and therefore one control function suffices. If the assumption is not true, then there could be unresolved endogeneity, and the parameter estimates could be biased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Variation of the Rival's Effect</head><p>One question is whether the rival's effect may evolve in different growth stages of a chain. For both KFC  ; more than 80% of new outlets were added to each company's territory map after 1999. To examine whether the positive effect from the rival differs in the conservative expansion era (pre-1999) and the aggressive expansion era (post-1999), we created a dummy named pre-1999, which takes the value of 1 for the years before 1999 and 0 otherwise. We include an interaction term of this dummy with the rival's stock of outlets in the expansion decision model. The results are shown in the left panel of Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. We find that for KFC, the rival's effect seems stronger in the post-1999 era when McD's has stronger presence, as suggested by the negative coefficient of the newly added interaction term. For McD's, the rival's impact does not differ significantly in the pre-and post-1999 stages. Note that the interaction term captures the overall change across time stages. For individual markets, the positive effect of the rival's presence decreases with one's own experience in the same market, as suggested by the negative interaction of the rival's stock of outlets and one's own local experience.</p><p>In addition, we examine whether the rival's impact is different in big versus small cities. Again, we add a simple interaction of the rival's stock of outlets and the dummy variable for big cities to capture the difference. The results are in the right panel of Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. We find that KFC's scale of presence has a positive effect on McD's expansion into both big and small cities, though the effect is stronger in big cities. However, McD's positive impact on KFC is mainly from the big cities.</p><p>Finally, we consider the case that the firms' actual decision window is longer than one year and check the rival's effect in this case. The idea is that even though one may observe the additions of new outlets from KFC or McD's in each year, firms may have their expansion plan made for longer periods and execute the plan during the time window. We therefore estimate the model (Equation ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>)) assuming that the decision window for both chains are two years instead of one. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Now the dependent variable is the number of new outlets to open in the past two years. Accordingly, the lagged variables mean the change in the last decision period (instead of last year). The results are provided in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. Although the aggregation of the information from yearly to biyearly reduces the number of observations for analysis and renders some of the estimates less accurate, the overall results are fairly close to the ones in Tables 4(a) and 4(b). We find the rival's net effect to be positive and significant.</p><p>A.1. Mapping from the Theoretical Framework to the Empirical Model In our empirical analysis, we specify the cost component as V / n it = c 0 + c 1 e it + c 2 e it time (in Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)). We expect the marginal cost of new store opening and operation to decrease with a chain's experience in the focal market as the first-order effect and that such cost savings may become smaller and smaller as time goes by or as the chain ages.</p><p>In Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), we specify a chain's own effect on expected market size as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">M e o H it = 1 S it + 2 e it + 3 e it time<label>(15)</label></formula><p>which is a function of own stock of outlets and own experience. For rival's impact on the expected market size, we further allow for the rival's impact to be attenuated by a chain's own experience in the local market as well as the overall age of the chain; therefore, Note that˜ 1 = 1 −b 2 / 2a 1 captures the net effect from the rival. One can not separately identify the positive and negative effects in the reduced-form analysis. The coefficients of the rest of the terms in the second line of the equation are simply scaled by a positive parameter, and the earlier predictions of and under two explanations preserve. 35</p><p>35 Specifically,˜ k = k / 2a 1 (k = 2 3 4 5) and˜ l = l / 2a 1 , where a 1 &gt; 0.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>Using an originally assembled data set on KFC and McD's expansion in China from their initial entry up to the year 2007, we investigate how the presence of a rival chain affects one's expansion decision, controlling for local market characteristics and own-chain characteristics. We find that the positive effects from the rival dominate the competition effect during the period under study, which leads to an overall positive rival impact on a chain's market expansion.</p><p>Our focus is to identify the driving forces of the positive effect from the rival. The empirical evidence suggests that market learning is likely to explain the positive influence of KFC on McD's expansion decision. That is, McD's uses KFC's entry and expansion patterns as signals of market size and growth. On the other hand, demand expansion is more plausible with McD's positive spillover on KFC. KFC benefits from McD's role of cultivating local consumers' taste to embrace Western fast food and is more likely to expand in cities with a long and large presence of McD's. However, we also want to acknowledge that there could be alternative explanations that rationalize the chain expansion pattern one observes. The bottom line is that we find the two chains respond differently to the expansion pattern of the rival chain, and such differences together with other empirical and institutional evidence are consistent with the explanations above.</p><p>This paper sheds light on how multinational firms make entry and expansion decisions in an emerging market. It empirically shows that under certain market environments, the rivals' presence may have a positive effect on a firm's expansion in the market. There are a number of avenues that future research can pursue. First, future research can be extended to structurally measure the multiple effects within and across chains. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> Our analysis can only identify the net effect from the rival's or own stock of outlets. A structural model is required to separate the positive and competition or cannibalization effect. Second, we study the positive impact from the rival within the product category. It would also be interesting to study the spillover effect across categories and industries in the context of entry and expansion in emerging markets. Last, but not least, examining the rivals' impact on entry in other industries or emerging markets may offer additional insights on different explanations of a rival's effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Simulation</head><p>We use simulation to check whether the parameters in the chain expansion model conditional on initial entry can be correctly recovered using the two-step method introduced in §4.1.</p><p>We first generate N replications of the data. To make the simulated data comparable to the original data, in each replication, the total number of markets is set at M = 246, and the total number of simulation time periods is T = 20, which matches the actual data. We also use the same initial condition observed in the data.</p><p>For the exogenous variables such as city characteristics and the distance between the focal city and the chain's headquarters, we take the value from the actual data. All the endogenous variables, including each firm's stock of outlets and experience in each period at each city, are generated by the model with a set of prespecified parameters. Since a firm's expansion decision is affected by the rival's expansion, both firms' decisions are generated in the same simulation loop.</p><p>The simulation proceeds as follows to generate one sample:</p><p>(a) Set the true values for the parameters in the model. (b) Take the random draws of the error terms. Specifically, for each firm i, we draw (1) M random draws from the normal distribution, u im ∼ N 0 2 iu , corresponding to the M markets;</p><p>(2) M * T random draws from the standard normal distribution, imt ∼ N 0 1 ; the realized random variables u im and imt affect the initial entry decision (Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)); and (3) M random draws from the normal distribution, im ∼ N 0 1 . The unobserved factor v im in the expansion stage is determined by v im = / u u im + 1 − 2 im . (c) Given the initial condition, we simulate both firms' entry and expansion decisions forward for each time period in each market. In the simulation loop, for time t of market m:</p><p>(i) We check whether chain i has entered city m before t. If not, given the parameters and the drawn unobserved factors u im and imt , compute the latent entry variable y * imt (Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)). The observed entry variable is set to be 1 if y * imt &gt; 0 and 0 otherwise. (ii) If chain i has already entered, we compute the expected number of new outlets to open E n imt according to</p><p>where W imt are the explanatory variables and im is the drawn random variable. Then draw a realization of n imt from the Poisson distribution with mean E n imt .</p><p>(iii) We save the entry and expansion decisions for each chain and update all the endogenous variables (including interaction terms) related to one's own stock, one's experience, its rival's stock, and its rival's experience in market m, which are important input factors for time t + 1 decisions.</p><p>After generating N samples using the procedure sketched above, we estimate each sample using the two-step method illustrated in the model part. In this simulation exercise, we include the following variables in the main model of chain expansion: (1) the variables that are directly related to  our tests of the two explanations-rival stock, rival experience, the interaction of rival stock and rival experience, and the growth terms; (2) all the other rival-related variables, including the interaction of rival stock and own experience, rival experience, and time and the number of stores rival opened in time t − 1; and (3) a variable to control one's ownchain effect and a variable for exogenous city characteristics. Although none of the own-chain-related variables is significant for both chains in the results, we control for own-chain experience for the completeness of model setup. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> For the initial entry condition, we control for a set of exogenous city   characteristics and a rival's stock of outlets. We omit several nonessential variables (e.g., density) to make the simulation clean and clear. Yet all the main variables, regardless of their significance level from our estimation, are kept in the simulation. Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.2 reports the means and standard deviations of parameter estimates based on 100 simulated samples, along with the true value of the parameters. <ref type="bibr">38</ref> The simulation results of the main model are presented in the upper panel. Note that all the key variables for our tests, which are rival stock, rival experience, the interaction of rival stock and rival experience, and rival's net growth in the last few periods, are well recovered. The parameter in front of the correction term ( im ), although not being accurately recovered, still correctly reflects the positive correlation between the unobserved factors in the initial entry and expansion decision as we set the correlation to be positive ( = 0 6) in the simulation. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> In addition, the term is able to control for the initial entry condition and leave the rest of the parameters in the expansion model being correctly inferred. The correction term is derived from the estimation of the initial entry decision. Although we are not trying to make an inference from the parameters in the initial entry condition, we also report the corresponding simulation results in the lower panel of the table. Overall, the parameters are close to their true value, but the coefficient in front of rival's stock tends to be underestimated.</p><p>In summary, the simulation exercise indicates that the key variables in the main model used to test the two explanations of positive rival effect can be well recovered using the <ref type="bibr">38</ref> As we apply the same model to both chains' expansion decisions, we report the results for one chain to show whether the model parameters can be correctly identified. The simulation results for another chain are similar. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> As derived in Equation ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), the coefficient in front of the correction term im is . As is not separately identifiable in the estimation, we only intend to infer the sign of the correlation parameter.</p><p>proposed two-step estimation procedure. We also want to point out that the ability to identify the impact of each variable depends on whether the chosen set of parameters can generate enough variation in the simulated chains' expansion paths. Different sets of parameters can lead to different degrees of variation in chains' expansion decisions, resulting in better or worse identification of some variables.</p></div>			</div>
