<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In many countries, wireless service providers bundle handsets with subscriptions to their wireless service, and handset vendors realize a bulk of their sales through service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Accenture 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> At times, a service provider and a handset vendor may enter into an exclusive arrangement, whereby the handset vendor makes one of its handset models available only to subscribers of that service provider. For example, in the United States, many handset models from LG Electronics, including top-selling ones such as the Chocolate, enV, and Venus, have been exclusive to Verizon Wireless (subscribers) (Rural Cellular Association (RCA) 2008). In fact, a 2010 U.S. industry report of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) suggests that the practice may be fairly prevalent; of the 67 smartphones launched in 2008 and 2009, 32 were launched exclusively <ref type="bibr">(FCC 2010)</ref>. From the data in this report, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the proportion of handsets launched exclusively by the four largest U.S.</p><p>1 Examples of such countries include Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Euromonitor 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mintel 2009a, b)</ref>. service providers. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Table 1 also provides similar information for smartphones available in the United States as of August 2011. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Examples of exclusive handsets in other countries include the Blackberry Storm from Research in Motion (RIM), which was exclusive to Vodafone in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Vodafone 2008)</ref>; and the DEXT from Motorola, which was exclusive to Optus in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Optus 2010)</ref>. In this paper, we examine the competitive rationale and the implications of such exclusive arrangements. Now, some exclusive handsets may very well be "branded variants" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bergen et al. 1996)</ref>; that is to say, they may be variants of handsets offered through another service provider from the same handset vendor, with minor differences in features. Branded variants are primarily meant to deter comparison shopping across service providers, rather than to address an underlying market need for variety (because of heterogeneity in consumer tastes). In such <ref type="bibr">Subramanian, Raju, and</ref>  a Source: FCC's 14th wireless market report <ref type="bibr">(FCC 2010</ref>). b Source: Service provider websites and press releases.</p><p>instances, an exclusive arrangement may not truly limit the handset vendor's ability to distribute handsets that are desirable to consumers. But, arguably, in other instances, including the examples noted earlier, the handset vendor is limited in this fashion. We are interested in this latter type of exclusive handset arrangement (EHA). For the exclusive handsets available in the United States as of August 2011, the authors found that a close variant was not available from another service provider in more than two-thirds of the instances (see Appendix A for details). At first glance, the rationale behind this practice might appear straightforward. An EHA is often regarded as a means for a service provider to differentiate itself from other providers (e.g., <ref type="bibr">CTIA 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, AT&amp;T Wireless 2009</ref>. Conventional wisdom suggests that a service provider can attract more subscribers by selling a desirable handset exclusively. The service provider, in turn, compensates the handset vendor for making its handset exclusive. Thus, both the service provider and the handset vendor potentially stand to benefit from such an arrangement.</p><p>But on closer examination, certain aspects are not quite clear. To begin with, when is an EHA mutually beneficial? For instance, whereas some handset vendors, such as LG and Samsung, have had EHAs for many of their handsets, others, such as Nokia and Motorola, have traditionally had relatively few. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Why might some handset vendors find this practice more attractive? Also, handsets exclusive in some markets may be nonexclusive in others. For instance, many of LG's handsets were exclusive in the United States but nonexclusive in the United Kingdom. Why might EHAs be more attractive in some markets than in others? Thus, the drivers for this practice need more careful investigation.</p><p>A second issue is, how does an EHA affect handset vendor market share? Typically, one might expect that exclusivity leads to lower handset market share. For instance, many industry analysts believe that Apple's exclusive iPhone arrangements have kept its market share "artificially low" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Elmer-Dewitt 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Savitz 2009</ref>). 5 However, a distinctive aspect of LG's business strategy in the U.S. market has been its EHAs (e.g., Investor's Business <ref type="bibr">Daily 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, RCA 2008</ref>, and yet during this time, it grew substantially at the expense of more established players. How was LG able to increase its market share despite having relatively many of its handsets sold exclusively? In other words, does an EHA necessarily lead to lower market share?</p><p>A third issue is the potential for anticompetitive effects. In the United States, smaller service providers petitioned the FCC to ban the practice of selling exclusive handsets, arguing that it restricts service provider competition <ref type="bibr">(RCA 2008)</ref>. Furthermore, a significant concern in the blocked merger of AT&amp;T Wireless (AT&amp;T) and T-Mobile was that the merged entity may use EHAs to hinder competition (e.g., Sprint Nextel 2011). But in France, the Supreme Court ruled that EHAs were not anticompetitive since competing handsets were still available to excluded service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(ZDNet France 2010)</ref>. Policy makers have also been concerned about the impact of this practice on handset innovation (e.g., U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Senate Hearing 2009)</ref>. Whereas some economists and legal scholars believe that EHAs foster innovation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hahn et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Ehrlich et al. 2010</ref>, others argue that it has the opposite effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Frieden 2009</ref>. Such concerns also relate to the broader debate on "wireless network neutrality" regarding whether service providers should be allowed to restrict the features and availability of certain handsets and applications. Thus, the competitive impact of this practice needs more formal examination.</p><p>Our objective in this paper is to conduct a modelbased examination of the rationale for a service provider and a handset vendor to form an EHA and its competitive implications, explicitly accounting for handset and service competition. Similar exclusive arrangements are also used in other industries. For instance, retailers have exclusive merchandise agreements with national brand manufacturers, videogame Marketing Science 32(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">246-270, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> console makers have exclusive third-party video games, and satellite and cable network companies have exclusive content and channels. To make our analysis more concrete, in this paper we focus on the wireless industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Main Results and Contribution</head><p>We find that an EHA may serve a dual strategic purpose. By restricting its handsets to one service provider, a handset vendor may be able to induce a rival handset vendor to compete less aggressively when supplying handsets; we refer to this as the supply price effect. At the same time, a service provider may be able to raise its rival's handset costs by limiting the handsets available to the rival; we refer to this as the cost-raising effect. We find that an EHA may be mutually profitable only if the exclusive handset is not too attractive to consumers relative to competing handsets. Interestingly, a handset vendor's market share may be higher when its handset is sold exclusively than when it is not. Our results might explain, for instance, why Nokia and Motorola, who have traditionally been the leading vendors in many markets, have relatively few EHAs compared with LG and Samsung, for example, and why Apple may have shifted away from having EHAs. Our results might also explain why some handset vendors seem to enjoy high market shares despite having many of their handset models sold exclusively, whereas, in other instances, exclusive handsets are blamed for artificially low handset vendor market share and profits.</p><p>Although conventional wisdom might suggest that service providers use exclusive handsets primarily to differentiate themselves from their competitors, we find that the cost-raising effect may instead be the main source of advantage a service provider gains from the EHA. In fact, a service provider may benefit even if the exclusive handset is relatively less attractive than competing handsets. Our results might thus explain why some service providers have several exclusive handsets (as seen, for instance, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); even if not all of these handsets are particularly attractive to consumers, they may still help by raising the rival's costs. Our analysis further sheds light on how service and handset market factors may influence the occurrence of EHAs and the value that firms gain from them. For instance, we find that the scope for EHAs may be higher when the consumers' propensity to use service is higher. This might explain, for instance, why exclusive handsets are more prevalent in the United States than in the United Kingdom. We also find that the service provider value from an EHA may be higher when its service differentiation is higher. Therefore, service providers may be well advised to not ignore their service dimension even as they strive to differentiate themselves through their handsets.</p><p>Two aspects of our model distinguish our approach from that used in prior work and may be useful to model similar situations. First, we do not restrict consumers to consume the bundled components (handset and service) in fixed proportion; consumers may consume multiple units of wireless service (i.e., cellphone minutes), and their demand for service is linked to their relative preference for the service provider. This allows us to distinguish between handset and service demand and investigate the impact of exclusive handsets on service pricing and usage. Second, we incorporate vertical and horizontal differentiation for both handset and service dimensions. This allows us to study how handset vendor and service provider characteristics, including their asymmetry, influence the outcomes. In this regard, we follow a demand modeling approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref> in the context of retailer store-national brand choice decisions. The advantage of this approach is that demand across distribution regimes can be modeled in a manner that is consistent with individual-level behavior and is yet analytically tractable. We extend their approach to our setting with service-handset bundles and show that analytical solutions can be obtained even when the handset vendors are asymmetric and the distribution regime is exclusive. 6</p><p>1.2. Relationship to Previous Research 1.2.1. Complementary Goods. Prior work on complementary goods has examined tying and bundling arrangements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Whinston 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Chen 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Choi and Stefanadis 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Ghosh and Balachander 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Basu and Vitharana 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Balachander et al. 2010</ref>) and component compatibility strategies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Matutes and Regibeau 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Economides 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Matutes and Regibeau 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Farrell et al. 1998</ref>. However, in much of this literature, a single firm provides both components. Furthermore, such arrangements essentially bind two components to be exclusively combined with each other, whereas, in our context, only the handset is exclusively bound to a service provider.</p><p>1.2.2. Channel Structure. Our work adds to the literature on determinants of distribution channel structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">McGuire and Staelin 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Coughlan 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Moorthy 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Coughlan and Wernerfelt 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Purohit 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Chiang et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Desai et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Kumar and Ruan 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">, Zhao et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Ofek et al. 2011</ref>. In particular, much of the prior research on exclusive arrangements in distribution channels has focused on two types of arrangements-namely, exclusive dealing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mathewson and Winter 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Besanko and Perry 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, O'Brien and Shaffer 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Bernheim and Whinston 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Lal and Villas-Boas 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Martimort 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Heide et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">, Stefanadis 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Simpson and Wickelgren 2007</ref> and exclusive territories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mathewson and Winter 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rey and Tirole 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dutta et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dutta et al. , 1999</ref>. Under exclusive dealing, a manufacturer requires a distributor to be exclusive to its brand. Under an exclusive territory arrangement, a manufacturer assigns distributors nonoverlapping territories in a market within which they have the exclusive right to sell the manufacturer's products.</p><p>The exclusive tie-in we examine in this paper constitutes a third type of arrangement, wherein a handset vendor assigns the exclusive right to sell its handsets to one service provider in the entire market. We find that such an arrangement leads to a different pattern of strategic interactions than identified in previous research. In particular, <ref type="bibr">Lin (1990), O'Brien and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shaffer (1993)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rey and Stiglitz (1995)</ref> show that exclusive dealing or exclusive territories can soften manufacturer competition; they find that an exclusive arrangement relaxes (downstream) competition between distributors, which, in turn, makes the (upstream) manufacturers' derived demand less elastic. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In contrast, we find that an EHA can moderate or intensify upstream competition. Moreover, even when an EHA moderates upstream competition, it does so despite the exclusive handset vendor facing more elastic demand. Rather, competition is moderated because, by restricting its supply of handsets to one service provider, the exclusive handset vendor may induce the rival handset vendor to compete less aggressively. Furthermore, from a service provider's perspective, we find that an EHA may effectively raise its rival's handset costs.</p><p>In ongoing work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Stennek (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Weeds (2009)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Hagiu and Lee (2012)</ref> examine the impact of exclusive content for television networks, and <ref type="bibr">Lee (2007)</ref> examines exclusive games for videogame consoles. However, the thrust of their work is in studying exclusivity in two-sided markets; they do not consider competition between upstream firms. Researchers have also examined exclusivity contracts for advertising (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Villas-Boas 1994, Dukes and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gal-Or 2003)</ref> and referral infomediaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen et al. 2002)</ref>. Their institutional contexts differ considerably from ours.</p><p>1.2.3. Raising Rival's Costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Salop and Scheffman (1983)</ref> introduce the notion of raising rival's costs and propose that a dominant firm may adopt strategies to raise the input costs of the competitive fringe. 8 <ref type="bibr">Krattenmaker and Salop (1986a, b)</ref> argue that an exclusionary arrangement preventing suppliers from supplying to a firm's rivals may be an effective cost-raising strategy. But, to our knowledge, this aspect of an exclusive distribution arrangement has not been formally studied. Much of the subsequent literature has examined whether a downstream producer may integrate with an upstream supplier to raise its rivals' costs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Salinger 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Ordover et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Hart and Tirole 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Vickers 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Gaudet and Long 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Riordan 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Choi and Yi 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Chen 2001</ref>). The nature of upstream competition (all-ornothing demand for inputs) and the behavior of the integrated firm (supplying inputs to a rival) examined in this context make it considerably different than the setting we study. Researchers have also examined cost-raising strategies in the context of exclusive dealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rasmusen et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Shaffer 2005</ref>, supply of inputs to rivals <ref type="bibr">(Economides 1998, Sibley and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Weisman 1998)</ref>, research and development (R&amp;D) investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banerjee and Lin 2003)</ref>, and outsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arya et al. 2008)</ref>. Our work formally examines the cost-raising effect of exclusive distribution arrangements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model Description</head><p>We consider a market with two competing wireless service providers, S A and S B , and two competing handset vendors, H 1 and H 2 . We examine a setting where handset vendors supply handsets to service providers, and service providers offer service subscriptions bundled with handsets to consumers. We assume that each handset vendor provides one handset model. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We do not model independent retailers who offer subscriptions from competing service providers. Our model may approximate the situation in markets where a majority of retail outlets are owned or exclusively franchised by service providers (such as the countries listed in footnote 1).</p><p>To begin with, we analyze the incentives for a focal handset vendor and a focal service provider to form an exclusive tie-in when a competing supply of handsets is available to all service providers. For instance, in the United States, when Apple was considering an EHA with AT&amp;T, the Blackberry from RIM was available to all service providers. Accordingly, we examine the situation where H 1 must decide if its handset will be available exclusively through S A or nonexclusively through both service providers, whereas H 2 's handset is available to both service providers. Later, we discuss the implications when (i) H 1 may choose the service provider to tie in with ( §5.1), (ii) service providers may make competing proposals to H 1 for an EHA ( §5.2), and (iii) H 1 may tie in with S A and H 2 may tie in with S B ( §5.3). Starting with the simpler scenario sheds light on the trade-offs faced by individual firms when considering an EHA and provides us with better intuition for the scenarios that follow. It also enables us to directly evaluate the French Supreme Court's argument that the availability of competing handsets should allay anticompetitive concerns regarding exclusive handsets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Consumer Preferences and</head><p>Buying Behavior As such, consumers have preferences over combinations of handset, service provider, and minutes of cellphone usage. Modeling demand in this setting presents a challenge. We follow an approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref> to model consumers' retailer store-national brand choice for semidurables and extend it to our context. This enables us to specify consumer preferences and decision making at the individual level while ensuring that the resulting demand functions are sufficiently tractable (even though they may be nonlinear). <ref type="bibr">10 11</ref> Specifically, we assume that consumers are aware of the handsets available in the market but are a priori uncertain about their preferences (or fit) for the handsets. A similar assumption is made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Shulman et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">), Villas-Boas (2009</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kuksov and Villas-Boas (2010)</ref>. In our context, because handsets are semidurables that are replaced every few years and new handsets are introduced every few months, consumers may not be fully familiar with the latest handset features. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We assume that consumers learn their handset preference when they visit a service provider store. In particular, even when consumers may be aware of handset features, they may not be able to ascertain their preferences until they visit the store because of the "touch-and-feel" nature of the 10 An individual-level model ensures that market demand under alternative distribution scenarios is internally consistent. Tractability is crucial as we need to solve for the successive pricing decisions of handset vendors and service providers. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> An alternative approach used in prior research is to model aggregate demand based on the preferences of a representative or "average" consumer who buys multiple units of each alternative. But in our context, as no individual consumer would typically buy multiple service-handset bundles, it is not clear that an aggregate approach is valid. It is also not clear how one would model demand for cellphone minutes for a representative consumer who has multiple subscriptions. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The handset replacement cycle is roughly two years in the United States and three years in western Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Oppenheimer 2009</ref>). product. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Indeed, as a recent market study describes <ref type="bibr">(Mintel 2008): 14</ref> Retail stores are a critical channel for cell phones: Given the personal nature of such devices, consumers need to be able to see and use products in person before purchase.</p><p>Alternatively, drawing from behavioral decision research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Payne et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">, Simonson 2008</ref>, it may also be that consumers have not a priori fully formed their preference and may "construct" their preference (through a process of deliberation) when they are at the store to make a purchase. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> A similar assumption is made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Shugan (1980)</ref> and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Guo and Zhang (2012)</ref>. Consistent with either interpretation, a J.D. Power market study found that, on average, consumers spend 56 minutes at the store for a typical cellphone transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mintel 2008)</ref>. We assume that the cost of visiting multiple service provider stores is sufficiently high so that all consumers make their buying decisions after visiting one service provider store. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We recognize at the outset that our assumptions may not fully characterize all consumers in a market. Rather, we believe that our approach may provide a reasonable approximation of consumer behavior that is useful to develop an analytically tractable and yet flexible framework to study a complex setting. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref>, the net impact of our assumptions is that consumers follow a sequential decision process: they first choose their service provider before their handset preferences are revealed and then choose the handset. As we show, this yields a multiplicative demand formulation that is considerably more tractable than that when consumers know their handset preference a priori and make their service-handset choice simultaneously or when they can visit multiple service provider stores without incurring any cost. In §F of the online electronic companion, we show that our main results are robust to these alternative consumer decision-making scenarios.</p><p>We assume that there is a unit mass of consumers. Let x and y be parameters that represent a consumer's taste for a wireless service and handset, respectively. We define these more precisely as we proceed.</p><p>Let U i j q x y denote the utility of a consumer with tastes x y when she has signed up for S i 's service along with H j 's handset and uses q ≥ 0 minutes of cellphone service, where i ∈ A B and j ∈ 1 2 . We assume that the utility from service is independent of the utility from handsets such that U i j q x y is additively separable into service and handset components as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U i j q x y = U S i q x + U H j y (1)</formula><p>where U S • and U H • are, respectively, the service and handset components. We also assume that the distribution of tastes for service (x) and handset (y) are independent. Consequently, the choice of handset does not affect service usage. This may be the case, for instance, when both handsets belong to the same category of phones (e.g., texting phones, smartphones) and have similar service capabilities but may differ in aspects such as brand image and industrial design that may not significantly impact service usage. In §G of the online electronic companion, we show that our main insights continue to hold when a handset of higher quality drives higher service usage, and thus, handset choice does impact service usage.</p><p>With regard to service preference, we assume that consumers are distributed uniformly along the unit interval 0 1 , with S A and S B located at 0 and 1, respectively, and x denoting a consumer's location. We assume that a consumer located closer to a service provider derives a higher utility from its service. For instance, service providers usually differ in their network coverage across different regions in the market (e.g., Consumer Reports 2009). The distance of a consumer from the service provider in our model may then correspond to the quality of network reception she receives from that service provider; consumers located closer to a service provider would correspond to those living in areas with better network reception from that service provider. Now, a consumer's preference for a service provider is also likely to influence how much of its service she will use. For instance, network reception may not only affect the quality of calls but also influence how many calls the consumer makes and the duration of each call. Accordingly, we assume that a consumer located closer to a service provider not only derives higher utility from its service but, as a result, will use more of its service.</p><p>We model the relation between cellphone usage and relative preference for service providers as follows. We assume that the utility from cellphone service is strictly concave and quadratic in the number of cellphone minutes used and that the marginal utility from an additional cellphone minute decreases linearly with the distance from the service provider. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U S A q x = V S + + 1 2 S − sx q − 2 q 2 (2a) U S B q x = V S + − 1 2 S − s 1 − x q − 2 q 2 (2b)</formula><p>where V S &gt; 0 is the base utility from cellphone service; &gt; 0, &gt; 0, and S are demand parameters that determine consumers' base propensity to consume service from each service provider; and s &gt; 0 is the sensitivity of a consumer's service usage to her preference for the service provider. Without loss of generality, we normalize to 1. The asymmetry in service quality between the service providers is captured by S . If S &gt; 0, then, all else being equal, consumers on average have a higher propensity to consume service when subscribing to S A than to S B . This could be because S A 's network quality or coverage is, on average, superior to S B 's. For instance, Verizon is considered to be the overall leader in network quality across the United States (e.g., Consumer Reports 2009). Furthermore, when S &gt; 0, more consumers would subscribe to S A than to S B , all else being equal. Similarly, if S &lt; 0, then, on average, all else being equal, consumers have a higher propensity to consume S B 's service than S A 's and more consumers would subscribe to S B than to S A . We interpret S as a measure of vertical service differentiation and refer to it as relative service quality. We say that S A is a better (poorer) service provider than S B if S &gt; 0 ( S &lt; 0). In contrast, s provides a measure of horizontal service differentiation and we refer to it simply as service differentiation; if s is larger, consumers have stronger preferences for their nearer service provider, and their service provider choice is less price sensitive.</p><p>With regard to handset preference, we assume that consumers are distributed uniformly along the unit interval 0 1 , with H 1 and H 2 located at 0 and 1, respectively, and y denoting a consumer's location, such that a consumer derives higher utility from the nearer handset vendor. Specifically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U H 1 y = V H + 1 2 H − hy (3a) U H 2 y = V H − 1 2 H − h 1 − y (3b)</formula><p>where V H &gt; 0 is the base utility from a handset, h &gt; 0 is a measure of horizontal differentiation between handsets, and H is a measure of vertical differentiation that could be due to unique aspects such as brand name or specific handset features. We note that H also represents the average relative preference across consumers for H 1 's handsets over H 2 's. We refer to H as relative handset quality and say that H 1 has a better (poorer) handset than H 2 if H &gt; 0 ( H &lt; 0). We refer to h simply as handset differentiation. We assume that consumers are a priori uncertain about their relative handset preference. We further assume that consumers are aware of the nature of uncertainty in their preference and hold beliefs that are consistent with reality. Specifically, the average relative preference H and the distribution of y are common knowledge. A consumer does not initially know her individual preference y and learns it when she visits a service provider store. Let V = V S + V H denote the overall base utility from having and using a cell phone. We impose the following restrictions that are sufficient to ensure interior solutions when solving for equilibrium: 17</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s ∈ 1 3 S ≤ s 1 50 + 3 5 s − 4 5 2 h ∈ 1 4 2 7 10 2 H ≤ 1 2 h 6h − 1 (4)</formula></div>

H 1 decides whether or not to make a proposal to S A for an EHA. If H 1 does not make a proposal, then the distribution regime is nonexclusive (NE), and Stage 2 is skipped.</p><p>Stage 2. H 1 proposes the wholesale price, w E 1 , for an EHA. S A can either accept or reject H 1 's proposal. If S A accepts the proposal, then the distribution regime is exclusive (E). Otherwise, the distribution regime is nonexclusive (NE).</p><p>Stage 3. In the nonexclusive distribution regime, H 1 and H 2 simultaneously set their handset wholesale prices, w NE 1 and w NE 2 , respectively. In the exclusive distribution regime, H 2 sets its handset wholesale price, w E 2 . Stage 4. Service providers simultaneously set upfront fixed fees for the subscription-handset bundles they offer and per-minute usage fee for cellphone minutes. We use F C ij to denote the fixed fee for H j 's handset bundled with S i 's subscription and p C i to denote S i 's usage fee, where C ∈ E NE indicates the distribution regime.</p><p>Stage 5a. Consumers observe the availability of handsets as well as the prices at each service provider and decide which service provider to visit.</p><p>Stage 5b. At the service provider store, consumers learn their handset preference and choose between the service-handset bundles available from that service provider.</p><p>We assume that H 1 proposes the wholesale price at which it can make its handset exclusive to S A , which puts H 1 in a better bargaining position relative to S A (because it makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer). In §5.2, we discuss the implications when H 1 and S A follow a Nash bargaining process and may use a side payment to redistribute the gains. We assume that if S A is indifferent between accepting and rejecting H 1 's proposal, then it accepts the proposal. We assume that H 2 observes whether S A accepted H 1 's proposal and is thus aware of the distribution regime when setting its wholesale price but is not aware of the terms of the proposal (w E 1 ). Thus, we maintain the information structure with regard to handset wholesale price decisions across both distribution regimes. In particular, H 1 does not become a Stackelberg price leader by virtue of having an EHA. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> We assume that service providers set prices taking handset wholesale prices to be given. In practice, handset wholesale prices are typically set on an annual or semiannual basis, whereas service providers update their prices more frequently. For instance, handset retail prices may be revised on a weekly basis. Consistent with what is typically observed in practice, we assume that a service provider charges the same usage fee for all its subscribers regardless of the handset they use. Service providers can, however, charge handset-specific upfront fees. In §J of the online electronic companion, we examine the setting where service providers do not charge a usage fee and offer "unlimited minutes" flat-rate plans. Because network capacity investments are typically "lumpy" and are of the fixed-cost variety, we assume that service providers do not face any marginal costs for providing service. In §6, we discuss the implications when service providers face a constant marginal cost for providing service.</p><p>We assume that firms are profit maximizers and correctly anticipate outcomes in future stages. Let C ∈ E NE denote the distribution regime indicating whether H 1 is exclusive (C = E) or nonexclusive (C = NE).

We use the sequential equilibrium as our solution concept. In particular, H 2 's wholesale price decision in Stage 3 under the exclusive regime is based on its beliefs about H 1 's wholesale price in the EHA. Furthermore, H 1 and S A base their EHA decisions on their beliefs about H 2 's wholesale price in the exclusive and nonexclusive regimes. In a sequential equilibrium, these beliefs must be consistent. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We solve by backward induction. As a matter of notation, for any variable z, we use z * to denote its value in a subgame equilibrium of the service provider pricing decisions and z * * to denote its value in a subgame equilibrium of the handset vendor pricing decisions.</p><p>We first examine the nonexclusive outcome in the subgame at Stage 3 (when H 1 decides not to make a proposal, or it makes a proposal, but is rejected). Then, we analyze the exclusive outcome in the subgame at Stage 2 (assuming S A accepts H 1 's proposal). Finally, we examine the equilibrium of the overall game.</p><p>3.1. Market Outcomes Without an EHA 3.1.1. Consumer Decisions. Consumers follow a sequential decision process. We solve for consumer decisions starting from the last stage after their handset preference is revealed. Suppose that a consumer at x subscribes to S i 's service and has handset preference y. Let q NE ix be this consumer's optimal level of service usage. We obtain q NE ix by maximizinĝ U NE i j q x y with respect to q. We find</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q NE Ax = + 1 2 S − sx − p NE A q NE Bx = − 1 2 S − s 1 − x − p NE B (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>Note that q NE ix is increasing in the propensity to consume service from the service provider, decreasing in the distance from the service provider, and decreasing in the service provider's usage fee. Furthermore, q NE ix is independent of the handset chosen, because this does not affect the utility from service consumption. Now, consider this consumer's handset choice. Her utilities from the two service-handset bundles are given bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">U NE i 1 q NE ix x y = V + 1 2 q NE ix 2 + 1 2 H − hy − F NE i1 (<label>8a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">U NE i 2 q NE ix x y = V + 1 2 q NE ix 2 − 1 2 H − h 1 − y − F NE i2 (8b)</formula><p>Let y =ŷ NE i denote the handset preference of a consumer who is indifferent between choosing either of these bundles at S i 's store.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">SettingÛ NE i 1 q NE ix x ŷ NE i =Û NE i 2 q NE ix x ŷ NE i</formula><p>, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">y NE i = h + H + F NE i2 − F NE i1 2h (9)</formula><p>We note thatŷ NE i is also the ex ante probability that a consumer who visits S i buys H 1 's handset.</p><p>Consider next how a consumer at x decides which service provider store to visit; she must take into account her optimal service usage and the expected outcome of her handset choice process. For a consumer at x, letŪ NE i x be the expected utility of visiting S i 's store.

One may think of the first component as the consumer's value from S i 's "baseline" subscription option (with H 2 's handset) and the second component as the consumer's value from the "handset variety" offered by S i (over and above H 2 's handset). We note that the consumer's value from handset variety is increasing in the probability that the consumer may actually buy the additional alternative. In other words, it is not simply the sheer variety that counts, but rather how attractive the variety actually is. In particular, the value from handset variety will depend on how each handset is priced and is thus determined endogenously. Letx NE be the location of the consumer indifferent between visiting either service provider.

Service Provider Pricing Decisions. As can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">13</ref>), service provider demand is considerably nonlinear in prices. The analytical approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref> is applicable when the upstream firms are symmetric and nonexclusive. But in our setting, handset vendors are asymmetric, and we also need to examine an exclusive distribution regime. Furthermore, in our context, service providers have an additional pricing decision: service usage fees. Thus, we adopt a different analytical approach than <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref>. As shown in Lemma 1 in Appendix B, we exploit the inherent structure of demand to obtain analytical solutions. Specifically, we reformulate each service provider's optimization problem in terms of the mix between the two handset-subscription alternatives (ŷ NE i ) and the subscription market share (x NE ), as follows: max</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">F NE ij p NE i NE S i = max x NE ŷ NE i p NE i NE S i (14)</formula><p>where we have substituted for F NE ij in terms ofx NE andŷ NE i using ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and (11). Intuitively, for each service provider, we solve for the optimal usage fee and mix between handset alternatives conditional on the subscriber market share of the service provider, and then we solve for the optimal subscriber market share. Lemma 1 in Appendix B describes the service providers' equilibrium strategies.</p><p>We find that handsets per se do not impact the competitive interaction between service providers as they are common to both service providers. The better service provider (S A if S &gt; 0, S B if S &lt; 0) attracts a larger subscriber market share. S A 's equilibrium subscriber market share is given bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">x NE * = 1 2 + 2 2 − s 3s 8 − 5s S<label>(15)</label></formula><p>In deciding their fixed fee and usage fee, service providers must take into account the variation in usage across their subscriber base. The marginal subscriber for each service provider is its lightest user, and its heavier users are located closer to the service provider. Consequently, for a given level of net utility delivered to the marginal subscriber (i.e., holdinĝ x NE constant), it is always optimal to charge a positive usage fee such that more surplus can be extracted from the heavier users who are located closer. We find that the usage fee is increasing in service differentiation (s) as this determines the extent of variation in usage between the heaviest and lightest user. We also find that the better service provider charges a higher usage fee because it has a larger subscriber base and, therefore, a larger variation in usage across subscribers. With regard to the fixed fee, we find that the service provider margin F NE * ij − w NE j is increasing in the consumers' propensity to use the service ( ). When is higher, consumers incur a higher disutility to switch from their closer service provider to the rival, which makes them relatively less price sensitive. The service provider margin follows an inverted-U relation with s. When s is higher, for a given level of service usage, a consumer incurs a higher disutility when she switches service providers. However, the consumer's optimal service usage level is decreasing in s. Thus, her absolute level of utility when subscribing to either service provider is lower when s is higher, and therefore the difference in their utilities may be lower. Consequently, the price sensitivity of consumers follows an inverted-U relation with s. We also find that the better service provider charges a higher margin for the fixed fee as consumers are willing to pay a premium for its service. Finally, we find that service provider profits are also increasing in and follow an inverted-U relation with s, and the better service provider earns higher profits.</p><p>3.1.3. Handset Vendor Pricing Decisions. Given the symmetry in supply configuration, handset vendors have the same market share at each service provider (see Lemma 1 in Appendix B). Hence, the derived demand for handsets is independent of the competitive interaction between service providers and is determined only by handset characteristics. In equilibrium, the better handset vendor charges a higher wholesale price, has a higher share of each service provider's subscribers, and earns higher profits. Lemma 2 in Appendix B describes the results.</p><p>To summarize, in the nonexclusive regime, the competitive interaction in the handset and service markets are essentially independent of each other, and the firms compete solely based on their individual merits. We next examine how this changes in the exclusive regime.</p></div>

We will refer to * E as S A 's market advantage from the EHA. The extent of this advantage directly depends on h ŷ E * A 2 , the consumer utility from the additional handset variety provided by S A . It also depends on service characteristics, and s, which determine how the additional handset variety influences consumers' choice of service providers. S A 's market advantage from an EHA is decreasing in and is initially decreasing and then increasing in s; as <ref type="bibr">21</ref> More precisely,ŷ <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">21</ref>) holds for the wholesale prices relevant for analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">E * A = max min h + H + w E 2 − w E 1 / 2h 1 0 . Equation (</formula><p>Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 246-270, © 2013 INFORMS discussed earlier, a higher makes its less attractive for consumers to switch service providers, whereas the attractiveness of switching is initially decreasing and then increasing with s. S A 's profits are strictly increasing in its market advantage * E (see Lemmas 1 and 3 in Appendix B). Interestingly, S A benefits when H 2 's wholesale price is higher ( * E is increasing w E 2 ). Even though an increase in H 2 's wholesale price is common to both service providers, it affects S B to a greater extent because S A has an exclusive, alternative supply of handsets from H 1 and is less reliant on H 2 's handsets. In particular, when w E 2 is higher, S A has the flexibility to price the handsets so as to shift demand to H 1 's handset (which translates to a higherŷ E * A and, therefore, a higher * E ). More generally, * E is increasing in the wholesale price differential, w E 2 − w E 1 ; i.e., S A benefits if H 2 's handsets were to become relatively more expensive than H 1 's in terms of their wholesale price.</p><p>Thus, conceptually, one can break down the effect of the EHA on service providers into two components: (i) a variety effect and (ii) a cost-raising effect. By variety effect, we mean the market advantage S A gains solely from the additional handset variety it provides, taking the wholesale prices to be the same as without the EHA. In fact, taking w E j = w NE * * j , we haveŷ E * A =ŷ NE * *</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A</head><p>and * E = 3h + H 2 / 27s 8 − 5s h . This is the contribution of handset variety alone to S A 's market advantage. By cost-raising effect, we mean the further market advantage S A gains depending on how the wholesale price differential changes under the exclusive regime. If the wholesale price differential is higher under an EHA, then this further enhances S A 's advantage; i.e., it effectively raises S B 's handset costs more than it raises S A 's. In such cases, we say that the EHA "raises the rival's costs." Otherwise, it weakens S A 's advantage, and we say that it "reduces the rival's costs." Which of these two occurs is determined by the competitive interaction between the handset vendors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Handset Vendor Pricing Decisions.</head><p>The derived demand for handsets now also depends on the competitive interaction between service providers. H 1 's prospects are closely tied to that of S A 's as it is exclusive to S A . Similarly, H 2 's prospects are closely linked to that of S B 's in that H 2 's market share is increasing in that of S B 's. We note that S A can never be worse off because its market advantage * E ≥ 0; in the worst case, S A will accept H 1 's proposal but not sell its handset (ŷ E * A = 0) and will make the same profits as in the nonexclusive regime. Therefore, S A always accepts H 1 's proposal. Then, H 1 's proposal maximizes its own profits in the exclusive regime. We solve for the equilibrium strategies in the usual manner. Lemma 4 in Appendix B describes the outcomes.</p><p>We find that the EHA may either intensify or moderate competition between handset vendors. On the one hand, H 1 faces a more elastic demand when it is exclusive than when it is not; H 1 's demand in the exclusive regime depends not only on its share of S A 's subscribers but also on S A 's share of the market, both of which are decreasing in its wholesale price (see Lemma 5 in Appendix B). Consequently, all else being equal, H 1 has a tendency to set a lower wholesale price than when nonexclusive, which can potentially intensify competition. On the other hand, H 2 no longer faces direct competition from H 1 for S B 's business. Although H 2 still competes indirectly with H 1 for S B 's subscribers (as part of S B 's subscriptionhandset bundle), the elimination of direct competition for S B 's business may potentially soften the competitive pressure on H 2 . Therefore, H 2 may have a tendency to set a higher wholesale price. The balance between these forces determines the intensity of handset vendor competition.</p><p>Thus, by limiting its handsets to one service provider, H 1 may in fact be able to induce H 2 to compete less aggressively. We note that if H 2 's wholesale price under the exclusive regime is the same as in the nonexclusive regime (i.e., w E 2 = w NE * *</p><p>2 ), then H 1 's demand is necessarily lower than the corresponding demand in the nonexclusive regime because its supply of handsets is restricted to S A . Thus, whether H 1 benefits from the EHA will critically depend on whether it induces H 2 to compete less aggressively. Stated differently, H 1 can be compensated for going exclusive only if it faces sufficiently lesser competitive pressure from H 2 . We will refer to the change in H 2 's wholesale price relative to the nonexclusive regime as the supply price effect. If w E * * 2 &gt; w NE * * 2 , then we say that the supply price effect is positive. We next examine when the EHA is mutually beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">When Does an EHA Occur?</head><p>We solve for the equilibrium of the overall game. S A strictly benefits from H 1 's EHA proposal, sincê y E * * A &gt; 0 in any EHA proposal that maximizes H 1 's profits. From H 1 's perspective, the supply price effect must be sufficiently high to compensate for its restricted access to the end consumer market. We find that this is possible only when H 1 's handset quality is not too high, i.e., if H ≤ 1H , where 1H is the threshold at which H 1 is indifferent between having and not having an EHA. We will refer to 1H as the scope for an EHA. When H 1 's handset quality is higher than 1H , S A 's market advantage from the EHA, * * E , is higher. This imposes a downward pressure on H 2 's wholesale price because its market share is more closely linked to that of S B . In other words, a higher H limits the extent by which the EHA can ease the competitive pressure on H 2 , leading to a lower, and possibly negative, supply price effect. Furthermore, H 1 's profits in the nonexclusive regime are also higher, thereby requiring a larger supply price effect for the EHA to be attractive. Thus, for both reasons, an EHA occurs only if H 1 's handset quality is not too high. The following proposition summarizes our findings.</p><p>Proposition 1. An EHA occurs only when the relative quality of the exclusive handset is not too high ( H ≤ 1H , where 1H is defined implicitly). The scope for an EHA (i) is increasing in consumers' propensity to use service ( 1H is increasing in ), (ii) follows an inverted-U relation with service differentiation ( 1H is initially increasing and then decreasing in s), (iii) is decreasing in handset differentiation ( 1H is decreasing in h), and (iv) is increasing in the relative quality of the service provider with the exclusive handset ( 1H is increasing in S ).</p><p>Proof. Refer to Appendix C. One might have expected that EHAs are more prevalent for more attractive handsets because they can help service providers differentiate themselves. But, interestingly, our analysis shows that if a handset is more attractive in that consumers are willing to pay a significant premium for it, then an EHA may not occur: although having such a handset exclusive may be advantageous for the service provider, it may not lead to a sufficiently high supply price effect to compensate the handset vendor. Our results could explain, for instance, why Nokia and Motorola, who have traditionally been the leading vendors in many markets, have typically avoided this strategy; to the extent that their handsets commanded a higher brand premium, they were better off making their handsets nonexclusive. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> As we discuss later in §6.1, it may also explain why Apple shifted its strategy from being exclusive. At the same time, to the extent that consumers are not willing to pay a similar premium for handsets from LG and Samsung, these handset vendors may have found EHAs more attractive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Impact of Market Factors</head><p>. Proposition 1 also describes how service and handset market characteristics affect the scope for an EHA. This depends on how these market factors influence the trade-off for the handset vendor. We find that the scope for an EHA is increasing in the consumers' propensity to use service ( ). When is higher, S A 's market advantage from the EHA is lower. On the one hand, this leads to a lower market share for H 1 when exclusive, making an EHA less attractive. On the other hand, it puts lesser pricing pressure on H 2 (because its market share is more closely linked to that of S B ), leading to a stronger supply price effect. We find that the latter aspect always dominates. Interestingly, the <ref type="bibr">22</ref> More recently, following a significant erosion of its brand image, Motorola has started having more EHAs (see Appendix A for list of exclusive handsets in the United States in August 2011).</p><p>scope for an EHA follows an inverted-U relationship with service differentiation (s); S A 's market advantage follows a U-shaped relation with s, and the impact of S A 's market advantage on the supply price effect outweighs its impact on H 1 's market share. We also find that the scope for an EHA is increasing in S A 's relative quality ( S ). A higher S results in a higher subscriber base for S A , which leads to a higher market share for H 1 when exclusive but to a lower supply price effect. In this case, the former aspect dominates. Finally, the scope for an EHA is decreasing in handset differentiation (h). When h is higher, the supply price effect may be weaker because S A 's market advantage is higher and H 2 's wholesale price in the nonexclusive regime is also higher to begin with. Furthermore, H 1 's profits in the nonexclusive regime are higher, thereby requiring a larger supply price effect to compensate for the restricted market access. Consequently, for both reasons, the scope for an EHA is lower.</p><p>These results may explain why EHAs may be more attractive in some markets than in others. For instance, the average cellphone usage (minutes used) in the United States is considerably higher than in the United Kingdom and other western European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ofcom 2009)</ref>. Then, to the extent that the propensity of consumers to use wireless service is higher in the United States, this might explain why exclusive handsets are more prevalent in the United States than in these other countries and why many handsets that are exclusive in the United States are nonexclusive in these other markets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">The Value of an EHA</head><p>We found that an EHA is not mutually beneficial if the handset quality is high. Conversely, and perhaps more importantly, even if a handset's quality is low, an EHA can be mutually profitable. In particular, this is true even when H &lt; 0. To understand why this is so, we examine the underlying factors that drive the value from an EHA. From the service provider's perspective, we find that an EHA always raises the rival service provider's costs; i.e., the equilibrium wholesale price differential with an EHA is always higher than without the EHA (w</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">E * * 2 − w E * * 1 &gt; w NE * * 2 − w NE * * 1</formula><p>). Thus, whenever an EHA occurs, S A benefits not only from the variety effect but also the cost-raising effect. In fact, we find that the latter always has a larger impact on S A 's profits than the former. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> In other words, the cost-raising effect may be the main source of advantage a service provider gains from an EHA.</p><p>Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 246-270, © 2013 INFORMS From the handset vendor's perspective, whenever an EHA occurs, we find that the supply price effect sufficiently eases the competitive pressure on the handset vendor such that its wholesale price when exclusive is always higher than when nonexclusive. Understandably, H 1 's share of S A 's business is higher when it is exclusive because the wholesale price differential between H 2 's and H 1 's handset is higher. But surprisingly, we find that even H 1 's overall market share can be higher when it is exclusive. Interestingly, this can occur only when H 1 's relative handset quality is sufficiently low. In such instances, the wholesale price differential between the handsets increases by such an extent that the corresponding increase in H 1 's share of S A 's business more than offsets the market lost by not serving S B . The following proposition summarizes our findings.</p><p>Proposition 2. When an EHA occurs, (i) it always raises the rival service provider's costs; (ii) the cost-raising effect has a larger impact on service provider profits than the variety effect; (iii) the wholesale price of the exclusive handset is always higher than without the agreement; and (iv) the exclusive handset vendor's market share may be higher than without the agreement if its relative handset quality is not too high (when s &lt; s 1 or h &gt; h 1 or s &gt; 2S , market share is higher if H ≤ 2H , where 2H &lt; 1H and s 1 , h 1 , 2S , and 2H are defined implicitly).</p><p>Proof. Refer to Appendix C. Service providers have often defended their use of exclusive handsets as a means to differentiate themselves from their competitors (e.g., <ref type="bibr">CTIA 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, AT&amp;T 2009</ref>. However, our results suggest an alternative account of why some service providers may have several exclusive handsets: even if only some of these handsets are particularly attractive to consumers, the rest may still help by raising the rival service provider's handset costs. Indeed, the main motivation for offering exclusive handsets may be to raise their rivals' costs rather than to obtain more attractive handsets. From a handset vendor's perspective, although EHAs are conventionally thought to lead to artificially low handset market share, we find that the reverse can also be true. Stated differently, not only might an EHA be profitable for a handset that would have otherwise not been popular, but in fact an EHA may increase the sales of such a handset and make it more popular. Our results suggest an interesting contrast between LG and Apple: to the extent that LG's handsets command a lower premium than Apple's, analysts may be right in blaming EHAs for Apple's low market share, while, at the same time, LG may owe its market share growth to its EHAs. 24  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> summarizes how service and handset market characteristics affect the value a service provider and the handset vendor gain from an EHA. It also provides a breakdown of the service provider value into the variety effect and the cost-raising effect. In the case of the value gained by a handset vendor, the impact of these market factors is essentially similar to their impact on the scope for an EHA. One exception is the impact of S A 's relative quality: when H 1 's relative handset quality is sufficiently below the threshold 1H , we find that the handset vendor's value may be decreasing in S . When S is higher, S A 's market share is higher, which has a negative impact on the supply price effect and a positive effect on H 1 's market share when exclusive. The former dominates when H is sufficiently low, and hence the handset vendor's value is lower.</p><p>For the service provider, compared to the nonexclusive regime, the market advantage it gains from an EHA enables it to not only extract more surplus from consumers but also extract surplus from more consumers. Consequently, the service provider's value from an EHA depends on the interplay between three factors: the market advantage it gains from the arrangement, the value consumers derive from the service, and the extent of service differentiation. The first factor determines the number of consumers from whom the service provider can extract surplus, and all three factors determine the surplus that the service provider can extract. We find that S A 's value from the arrangement is increasing in consumers' propensity to use service ( ); whereas S A 's market advantage is decreasing in , the surplus that S A can extract is increasing in . Interestingly, S A 's value from the arrangement may be always increasing, or always decreasing or follow an inverted-U relation with service differentiation (s); whereas service differentiation is itself increasing in s, the value consumers derive from the service is decreasing in s and the market advantage is initially decreasing and then increasing in s. Furthermore, S A 's value from higher handset market share. Our results show that even in the absence of such promotion, an EHA can increase handset market share and that this occurs when the handset quality is sufficiently low.</p><p>the arrangement may be always increasing or always decreasing, or it may follow an inverted-U relation in the service provider's relative quality ( S ). A higher S leads to a higher market share for S A , which may weaken the cost-raising effect by increasing the competitive pressure on H 2 . Consequently, even though the surplus the service provider can extract is increasing in S , the value from the EHA may be decreasing. We also find that the service provider's value is always increasing in handset differentiation (h) and in the exclusive handset's relative quality ( H ) because S A 's market advantage is increasing in these factors. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> also depicts how the value gained due to the variety effect and the cost-raising are affected by the market factors.</p><p>Exclusive handsets are at times seen as a means to compensate for a lack of service provider differentiation. Indeed, we do find that a service provider benefits from the variety effect of an EHA. But we also find that an EHA may be a means to leverage the service provider's existing service differentiation. The service provider's value from an EHA is higher when its horizontal and vertical service differentiations are higher. Furthermore, from Proposition 1, we note that the scope for an EHA may be increasing in the horizontal and vertical service differentiation; a higher scope allows for EHAs with better handsets, which in turn increases the service provider's value from the arrangement. Therefore, service providers may be well advised to not ignore their service dimension even as they strive to differentiate themselves from their competitors through their handsets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Competitive Implications</head><p>of an EHA 4.1. Impact on the Rival Service Provider and Rival Handset Vendor As may be expected, the rival service provider is always worse off because the EHA worsens its handset variety and effectively raises its handset costs; its margins, subscriber market share, and service demand are all lower under an EHA. Because H 2 's prospects are closely linked to that of S B 's, one might expect that it too is worse off. Instead, we find that H 2 is actually better off whenever an EHA occurs because, in such instances, the competition between handset vendors is less intense. Proposition 3. When an EHA occurs, the rival service provider is always worse off and the rival handset vendor is always better off than without the EHA.</p><p>Proof. Refer to Appendix C. Our results might explain complaints against exclusive handset arrangements from the excluded service providers in the United States and in <ref type="bibr">France (e.g., RCA 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">, ZDNet France 2010</ref>. Moreover, when Apple's iPhone shifted its distribution from being exclusive to nonexclusive, rival handset vendors faced increased competitive pressure and lost considerable market share to Apple at the previously excluded service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lagorce 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, NPD Group 2011</ref>. Our model predicts that this increased competitive pressure would have also forced rival handset vendors to lower their handset price to service providers. Conversely, rival handset vendors would have benefited from the reduced competitive pressure had Apple remained exclusive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Impact on Market Prices, Service Usage, and Consumers</head><p>We find that the fixed fees of both service providers are higher when there is an EHA. S A 's fixed fees are higher both because of its higher margin and higher handset wholesale prices, and S B 's lower margin is more than offset by H 2 's higher handset wholesale price. Because S A 's market share is higher with an EHA, there is more variation in usage across its subscriber base and it charges a higher usage fee than when nonexclusive. Correspondingly, S B 's service usage fee is lower when there is an EHA because its market share is lower. S A 's subscribers are worse off than without the EHA as they face strictly higher fixed and usage fees. The service usage of those consumers who switched to S A for the exclusive handset is further negatively impacted as they subscribe to their less preferred service provider. Moreover, we find that all of S B 's subscribers are also worse off; although these consumers benefit from the lower service usage fee, this is more than offset by the disutility from higher fixed fees and reduced choice of handsets. Finally, we find that the average service usage across subscribers is always lower. Proposition 4. When an EHA occurs (i) servicehandset subscription fees are higher than without the EHA, (ii) the service usage fee for the exclusive handset service provider (excluded service provider) is higher (lower) than without the EHA, and (iii) average service usage is lower and all consumers are worse off than without the EHA.</p><p>Proof. Refer to Appendix C. One might think that an EHA only affects consumers who could not switch service providers for a desired handset and those who switched to a less preferred service provider for an exclusive handset. But we find that even those who did not have to switch service providers for the exclusive handset and those who would not have bought the handset had it been nonexclusive may also be negatively impacted. Thus, a larger group of consumers may be adversely affected than it may have initially seemed. Our results cast doubts on the arguments of the French Supreme Marketing Science 32(2), pp. <ref type="bibr">246-270, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> Court that the availability of competing phones for the excluded service providers should allay anticompetitive concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Impact on Handset Innovation</head><p>Proponents of wireless network neutrality (WNN) have argued that EHAs may hinder handset innovation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Frieden 2009</ref>). To shed light on this issue, we compare H 1 's incentive to improve its relative handset quality ( H ) under the exclusive and nonexclusive regimes in instances where an EHA occurs. As we show in Lemma 6 in Appendix B, we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">d C * * H 1 d H = D C * * A1 + D C * * B1 1 + w C * * 2 H (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">)</formula><p>where C ∈ E NE is the distribution regime. Thus, an increase in the relative quality of H 1 's handset can be thought of as having two effects-namely, (i) a market share effect, as denoted by D C * * A1 + D C * * B1 ; and (ii) a competitive response effect, as denoted by w C * * 2 / H . <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The larger H 1 's market share, the more valuable the increase in handset quality, because this is leveraged over a larger base of customers. The larger the (magnitude of the) competitive response, the less valuable the increase in handset quality, because this limits H 1 's ability to capture the value created by higher handset quality. We find that in instances where an EHA occurs, the competitive response effect is higher under the exclusive regime than under the nonexclusive regime. We find that the competitive response effect offsets the market share effect when H 1 's market share is higher under the exclusive regime, and the two reinforce each other when H 1 's market share is lower under the exclusive regime. Consequently, H 1 's incentive to improve its handset quality is always lower than under the nonexclusive regime.</p><p>Proposition 5. When an EHA occurs, the exclusive handset vendor's incentive to improve its handset quality is lower than under the nonexclusive regime.</p><p>Proof. Refer to Appendix C. Our results support the perspective of WNN proponents regarding handset innovation. An EHA may limit both the market base over which a handset vendor can leverage its innovation and the value that can be captured owing to the rival's reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Extensions</head><p>To gain further insights, we examine three separate extensions to our basic model. We discuss here only the key results. The details can be found in the online <ref type="bibr">25</ref> We note that w C * * 2 / H &lt; 0. electronic companion. Furthermore, in § §F-J of the online electronic companion, we show that our main results are robust to the following extensions: (i) when consumers make service-handset choices simultaneously, (ii) when service usage is higher with higher quality handsets (such that handset choice affects service usage), (iii) when H 1 is a Stackelberg price leader with respect to H 2 in the nonexclusive and exclusive regimes, (iv) when there is a third competing handset vendor (such that S B is not dependent only on H 2 in the exclusive regime), and (v) when service providers offer service plans with unlimited minutes. 26</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">With Which Service Provider to Tie In</head><p>In §A of the online electronic companion, we consider that H 1 can choose a service provider to negotiate an EHA. We find that whereas H 1 's market share is higher if it ties in with the better service provider, an arrangement with the poorer service provider eases the competitive pressure on H 2 to a greater extent, leading to a higher supply price effect. Interestingly, the latter aspect may dominate in some instances, and it may be more profitable for a handset vendor to tie in with the poorer service provider. Thus, a handset vendor may actually prefer not to tie in with the better service provider. For instance, in the United States, Verizon is considered to be the better service provider with regard to overall network quality (e.g., Consumer Reports 2009) compared with its rivals. Yet one observes that other service providers also have many exclusive handsets. We also find that the scope for an EHA is higher for the better service provider, which suggests that the better service provider is likely to have better exclusive handsets. In §B of the online electronic companion, we examine an alternative process for the choice of service provider, whereby service providers may make competing proposals to H 1 for an EHA. We find that the results are qualitatively similar to before in the following sense: the service provider that would have been more attractive for H 1 to negotiate an arrangement is the one that makes the better competing offer. 27</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Use of Side Payments</head><p>In §C of the online electronic companion, we consider that H 1 and S A may use a side payment to share the surplus from an EHA and follow a Nash bargaining process to determine the terms of the arrangement. In this case, whenever the negotiation is successful, the handset wholesale price under the exclusive regime is set to maximize the joint profits of H 1 and S A , and their relative bargaining power determines how the surplus is shared. We find that the side payment is always from the service provider to the handset vendor. In practice, this may be in the form of the service provider sharing product development or promotional expenses. We find that the scope for an EHA may be higher or lower than without side payments. On the one hand, side payments allow the transfer of some of the service provider's surplus to the handset vendor, which can increase the scope. On the other hand, H 1 's wholesale price is lower (as it is set to maximize joint profits), intensifying the competitive pressure on H 2 and lowering the supply price effect, which can decrease the scope. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows how the joint value from an EHA is affected by market factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Equilibrium Industry Structure</head><p>In §D of the online electronic companion, we examine the equilibrium industry structure when the service providers are symmetric and H 1 can negotiate an EHA with S A , and H 2 with S B . <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In particular, this allows us to evaluate the French Supreme Court's argument that if excluded service providers can form EHAs with other handset vendors, then there would be no cumulative anticompetitive effects. We find that when the difference in handset qualities is sufficiently high, only the poorer handset vendor may form an EHA, and our earlier results continue to hold. Whereas when the difference in handset quality is not too high, both handset vendors may form EHAs. Average service usage is lower than in the nonexclusive regime but higher than when only S A could form an arrangement. Handset prices and up-front subscription fees are, however, higher than when only S A could form an arrangement. Once again, our results cast doubts on the arguments of the French Supreme Court.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>6.1. Managerial Implications 6.1.1. Handset Vendor's Perspective. For a handset vendor, an EHA can be a means to induce its rival to compete less aggressively by limiting the availability of its handsets. Such a strategy may be profitable only when the handset is not too attractive to consumers relative to competing handsets. Moreover, a handset vendor's market share can actually be higher when it is exclusive if the handset is not too attractive; otherwise, its market share is lower when exclusive.</p><p>The shift in Apple's distribution strategy for the iPhone from initially being exclusive to later being nonexclusive provides an interesting context to understand our results. Apple was new to the handset market when it launched the iPhone, and its reputation as a handset vendor had not been established. In fact, its earlier attempt to enter the handset market through a partnership with Motorola had failed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(AT&amp;T 2009)</ref>. Thus, to the extent that Apple may have been unsure about how attractive the iPhone would be to consumers, our analysis suggests that an exclusive strategy may have been sensible. However, since the launch, Apple's reputation grew and became more certain. Furthermore, Apple has substantially improved the iPhone's features and created a significant franchise of third-party applications, all of which made the iPhone more attractive to consumers. Consequently, an exclusive strategy would have become less attractive. Indeed, industry analysts believed that, by remaining exclusive, Apple was keeping its market share artificially low and leaving money on the table <ref type="bibr">(Elmer-Dewitt 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Savitz 2009)</ref>. When the iPhone eventually became nonexclusive, rival handset vendors faced increased competitive pressure and lost considerable market share to Apple at the previously excluded service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lagorce 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, NPD Group 2011</ref>. Our model predicts that this increased competitive pressure would have forced rival handset vendors to also lower their handset prices to service providers. Conversely, had Apple remained exclusive, these rival handset vendors would have benefited from the reduced competitive pressure.</p><p>6.1.2. Service Provider's Perspective. The conventional perspective that EHAs are primarily meant to help service providers differentiate themselves from their competitors may overlook several aspects. First, if a handset is very attractive to consumers, then the handset vendor may not find it profitable to have an EHA. Thus, a service provider may be restricted in how attractive its exclusive handsets can be. Second, an EHA may also be a means to raise a rival service provider's handset costs by limiting the handsets available to the rival. In fact, this may be a bigger source of advantage than differentiation through handset variety. Consequently, our findings suggest that even if an exclusive handset is relatively less attractive than competing handsets, the service provider may nevertheless benefit from the cost-raising effect. Indeed, this may be the reason why Marketing Science 32(2), pp. 246-270, © 2013 INFORMS some service providers may have several exclusive handsets; although only some of them may be particularly attractive, the rest may still help raise the rival's costs. Finally, even as service providers strive to differentiate themselves through handsets, we find that they may be well advised not to ignore their service dimension. A service provider may have to be sufficiently differentiated to tie in with more attractive handsets. Also, the service provider's value from an EHA may be higher if its service differentiation is higher. Thus, our results provide a broader perspective on how service providers can leverage and benefit from exclusive handsets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Policy Implications</head><p>Although our results support concerns regarding potential anticompetitive impact of EHAs, others have argued against such effects. The French Supreme Court held that exclusive handsets were not anticompetitive because competing handsets were still available to the excluded service providers (ZDNet France 2010). The court further stated that it did not expect cumulative anticompetitive effects if the excluded service providers could form EHAs of their own. Critics of WNN have likened EHAs to other forms of vertical restraints seen in other industries and argue that these restrictions facilitate coordination between service providers and handset vendors, thereby improving market efficiency that ultimately benefits consumers. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hahn et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ehrlich et al. (2010)</ref> argue that, similar to exclusive dealerships, handset exclusivity encourages the service provider to promote the handset aggressively, whereas, without exclusivity, a service provider may be concerned about rivals free riding on its handset promotion efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ehrlich et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Faulhaber et al. (2012)</ref> argue that handset exclusivity reduces the product development risk for handset vendors by encouraging a service provider to make sufficient up-front purchase commitments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hahn et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ehrlich et al. (2010)</ref> also argue that because the handset vendor typically "freely" agrees to exclusivity, this must imply that EHAs can only be for efficiency reasons and must create incentives for handset innovation.</p><p>Although our model does not capture the potential sources of efficiency identified above, it highlights sources of inefficiency that may have been overlooked. Unlike in the case of an exclusive dealership for a stand-alone product, an exclusive handset is bundled along with service from a particular service provider. Then, to the extent that consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for handsets and service, such an arrangement (a) distorts consumers' choices of handset, service provider, and service usage; and (b) significantly limits the handset vendor's access to end consumers, which distorts competition. In this context our analysis shows that, even when competing handsets are available to the excluded service providers, an EHA may not only lead to higher service and handset prices, which lower consumer welfare and market efficiency, but may also reduce the exclusive handset vendor's incentive to improve its handset quality-despite competing handsets being available to the excluded service providers. Moreover, it may in fact be the market inefficiencies created by the EHA that motivate the handset vendor to freely agree to the arrangement. Furthermore, when the excluded service provider can form an EHA of its own, the anticompetitive effects may persist and even worsen. Our results thus support concerns raised by the proponents of WNN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Relevance to Other Industries</head><p>Our findings may be of interest to firms in other industries that have similar exclusive arrangements in competitive contexts, whereby one firm (corresponding to the handset vendor) agrees to make its offering available exclusively with that of another firm (corresponding to the service provider), but not vice versa. For instance, retailers may have exclusive merchandise agreements with national brand manufacturers, videogame console makers may have exclusive thirdparty video games, and satellite and cable network companies may have exclusive content providers. We note that some of our assumptions may not readily extend to other industry settings. We assumed that one firm provides a product while the other provides a service. We do not, however, expect that this influenced the nature of the strategic interactions per se. We further assumed that consumers follow a sequential decision process. But we relaxed this assumption in §F of the online electronic companion and found that our main insights continue to hold qualitatively, and may even be stronger. We also assumed that the firms providing complementary offerings are engaged in a vertical relationship. In particular, handset vendors were Stackelberg price leaders to the service providers. Alternative game structures may apply in other industry settings, which may influence the strength of the supply price effect and the cost-raising effect. For instance, they may be weaker if prices of complementary components are set simultaneously. Finally, there may be other industry-specific factors that our model does not capture. We leave it for future research to examine these issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Although our analysis provides a competitive rationale for an EHA, an alternative explanation could be that an unfamiliar handset brand may utilize exclusive distribution through a reputable service provider to build market awareness and reputation. For instance, this may be relevant for foreign brands such as LG and Samsung in the U.S. market. As such, we cannot rule out this alternative explanation, and further empirical analysis may be necessary to distinguish between these drivers. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Because network capacity investments are typically lumpy and are of the fixed-cost variety, we assumed that service providers do not face any marginal costs of providing service. But in some instances, a service provider may lease additional capacity and incur a variable cost. In §K of the online electronic companion, we show that our results continue to hold qualitatively if service providers face a constant marginal cost of providing service. Service providers may also face network congestion because of capacity constraints, which may degrade the quality of their service. Future research may examine how EHAs affect service provider network quality and investments in network infrastructure.</p><p>We assumed the locations of the handset vendors (along the y dimension) to be exogenous. As is known from previous research (e.g., d <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">'Aspremont et al. 1979</ref>), a Hotelling-line setup, such as ours, with linear transportation costs is not well suited to analyze optimal location decisions, because a pure-strategy price equilibrium does not exist for a range of firm locations. Nevertheless, in §L of the online electronic companion, we conduct some limited analysis by considering that each handset vendor may choose between two locations. We find that it is a dominant strategy for handset vendors to locate closer to each other, and our main insights continue to hold qualitatively. We do note that the location outcome is likely to be sensitive to our assumption of linear transportation costs. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> It is beyond the scope of our current work to consider nonlinear transportation costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electronic Companion</head><p>An electronic companion to this paper is available as part of the online version at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/ mksc.1120.0752.</p><p>Appendix A. Data Collected by Authors for Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 in  §1</ref> We identified the handsets available from the four largest U.S. service providers (as of August 7, 2011) from their websites. We focused on the smartphone category because this accounted for a majority of the handsets currently offered. We considered only handsets from major handset vendors: Apple, HTC, HP/Palm, LG, Motorola, Nokia, RIM, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson. We used service provider press releases to identify handsets launched exclusively. Additionally, Verizon identifies its exclusive handsets as "exclusively available through Verizon Wireless" on its website (http://www.verizonwireless.com; accessed August 2011). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">A</ref>.1 summarizes these data.</p><p>Only handsets that were launched exclusively and remained exclusive for at least six months were considered to be exclusive launches. Four such exclusive handsets later became nonexclusive and are indicated by a superscript a in Table A.1. For example, the iPhone 4G was launched exclusively by AT&amp;T in June 2010 and became available from Verizon in February 2011. In some cases, we collected some additional information to determine whether a handset could be considered exclusive. For example, the iPhone 3GS, which is sold exclusively, was succeeded by the iPhone 4G, which is currently not sold exclusively. But we found that the iPhone 3GS continues to be a top-selling model even more than a year after the iPhone 4 was released. Another example is that product reviews described the Motorola XPRT as Sprint's version of the Motorola Droid Pro that was exclusively launched from Verizon. So we concluded that Verizon's exclusivity agreement had concluded.</p><p>Although it is not straightforward to objectively determine to what extent a handset model is simply a branded variant or is meant to address an underlying market need, we devised some criteria to ascertain whether an exclusive handset had a "close" variant available through another service provider at the time of launch or within six months following its launch. We used online product reviews and comparisons from two leading handset review websites, CNET.com and Engadget.com, to judge how close an exclusive handset was to other handsets from the same handset vendor available from other service providers. We also collected information about how the handset vendor distributed its handsets in another market; we chose the United Kingdom because information was more easily available for this market. If a handset vendor offered comparable models exclusively through different service providers in the United States but offered similar comparable models nonexclusively in the United Kingdom market, then we deemed that it is valuable for the handset vendor to provide this variety to end consumers. For instance, from product reviews we found that Samsung's Fascinate (Verizon), Captivate (AT&amp;T), Epic 4G (Sprint), and Vibrant (T-Mobile) were all variants of the Samsung's Galaxy S handset.  Furthermore, in the United Kingdom, we found that Samsung offered only one version of the Galaxy S to all service providers. Therefore, we concluded that the handset models in the United States were close variants. In contrast, although HTC's Droid Incredible (Verizon) and Inspire 4G (AT&amp;T) are both Android-based smartphones, we found from product reviews that they were, respectively, based on HTC's Incredible S and Desire HD handsets. Furthermore, both of these models were available nonexclusively from all service providers in the United Kingdom. Thus, we concluded that the Incredible S and Desire HD were distinct variants, and the Droid Incredible did not have a close variant; we concluded, however, that Inspire 4G did because Thunderbolt 4G (Verizon) was also based on the Desire HD handset. Based on this approach, we concluded that 9 of the 32 exclusive handsets were "close variants. </p></div>

Proof. We first construct an equilibrium where both service providers sell H 2 's handset and then rule out an equilibrium where only S B sells H 2 's handset. From Lemma 3, the handset vendor profit functions are given by In equilibrium, the following first-order conditions must hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">E * H 1 = w E 1 1 2 + 2 2 − s 3s 8 − 5s S + 4h 3s 8 − 5s • h + H + w E 2 − w E 1 2h 2 • h + H + w E 2 − w E 1 2h (<label>B11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_53">E * H 2 = w E 2 1 − 1 2 + 2 2 − s 3s 8 − 5s S + 4h 3s 8 − 5s • h + H + w E 2 − w E 1 2h 2 • h + H + w E 2 − w E 1 2h (B12)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">d E * H 1 dw E 1 = 0 d E * H 2 dw E 2 = 0 (B13)</formula><p>These are nonlinear simultaneous polynomial equations in w E * * 1 and w E * * 2 . To solve these equations, we use the following change of variables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">w E * * 1 = t + d + h + H 2 w E * * 2 = t − d − h − H 2 (B14)</formula><p>Substituting in (B13) and rearranging, we obtain which is a cubic equation involving only d. It is tedious to show by hand (using Descartes' sign rule) but can be easily verified using analytical software such as Mathematica that, given our parameter range, this equation has one real root. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> We also have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">d E * H 1 dw E 1 − d E *</formula><formula xml:id="formula_57">d E * H 1 dw E 1 + d E * H 2 dw E 2 = 0 =⇒ t = 12h 2 s 8 − 5s 6d 2 + 3hs 8 − 5s + 4h 2 − s S (B17)</formula><p>Thus, there is a unique candidate for an equilibrium where both service providers sell H 2 's handset. We verify numerically that this candidate satisfies the requisite boundary conditions for an internal solution (market shares are positive and wholesale prices are positive). <ref type="bibr">32</ref> We further verify numerically that, given w E * * 1 , it is not profitable for H 2 to set its wholesale price such thatŷ E * S A = 0, and it serves only S B . Therefore, there is a unique equilibrium where H 2 serves both service providers. Now suppose, toward a contradiction, there exists an equilibrium where the wholesale prices are such that S A does not find it worthwhile to sell H 2 's handset. We will use the superscript EE to denote the variables in this scenario. Lemma 7 provides the service providers' subgame equilibrium strategies for this scenario.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">We thank the associate editor for suggesting this interpretation.14 According to a Euromonitor report, online sales accounted for less than 10% of overall handset sales in many markets<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Euromonitor 2009</ref>).15  We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.16  In §E of the online electronic companion, we show that if consumers incur a disutility to visit each service provider store and V − 2 2 &gt; &gt; 2h, then it is optimal for consumers to always visit only one service provider store even when service providers offer asymmetric product lines.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="17">These restrictions mainly ensure that H 2 has positive market share among S A 's subscribers in the exclusive regime. Outside this parameter range, H 2 's demand may be kinked in the relevant range of analysis and a pure-strategy equilibrium may not exist. Also, the upper bound on s ensures that the service provider market is fully covered.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="18">In §H of the online electronic companion, we examine a setting where H 2 is aware of H 1 's wholesale price under both distribution regimes, and thus H 1 is a Stackelberg price leader.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="19">To fix these beliefs endogenously and ensure uniqueness of the equilibrium, we introduce a small tremble in H 1 's decision in Stage 1 so that these beliefs are not off the equilibrium path even if H 1 decides not to make a proposal.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="20"> In (11), the denominator for the second and third terms adjusts for the trade-off in up-front fees and handset to be comparable to the trade-off in service consumption; although a consumer consumes one service subscription and one handset, she consumes multiple units of the service.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">The impact of the variety effect is the increase in S A 's profits relative to the nonexclusive regime solely because of the additional handset variety, taking the handset wholesale prices to be the same as in the nonexclusive regime. The impact of the cost-raising effect is the further increase (or decrease) in S A 's profits given the handset wholesale prices in the exclusive regime.Subramanian, Raju, and Zhang: Exclusive Handset Arrangements in the Wireless Industry</note>

Refer to the individual sections in the online electronic companion for details.27  When service providers can make competing proposals that include a side payment, we then find that only the better service provider may make the winning proposal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C. Proofs for Propositions in § §3 and 4</head><p>About Verifying Results Numerically in Propositions 1-5 We first note that given , all other parameters in the model are bounded. Furthermore, by scaling s and S with respect to , and h and H with respect to 2 , the model can be normalized with respect to . Thus, the entire parameter space can be spanned numerically. And if our results hold for, say, = 1, then they can be extended to any . Now the wholesale price strategies under the exclusive regime that are needed to verify Propositions 1-5 are only implicitly defined in Lemma 4 in terms of the variable d, which is the root of a certain cubic equation. As a result, we find that it is not possible to analytically verify the results and, therefore, must resort to a numerical approach. We follow a part analytical-part numerical approach where we substitute specific values for some of the parameters and then evaluate the resulting expressions analytically using Mathematica. For example, in the proof of Proposition (1),</p><p>H 1 is known in terms of d, we set = 1 and consider 100 specific equally spaced values of s in the range 1 3 1 . For each specific value of s, we use Mathematica to show that whenever the condition for d in Lemma 4 is satisfied,</p><p>34 In cases where we need to compute a derivative for an expression involving d, we use implicit differentiation. For example, in the proof of Proposition 1, to show</p><p>and d/ H is obtained by applying the implicit function theorem to Lemma 4. We then show the result numerically by setting = 1 and considering a grid of specific values for s and h. For each point on this grid, we use Mathematica to show the desired result.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 1. An EHA occurs if</p><p>&gt; 0 at the lower bound for H in (4), and E * * H 1 − NE * * H 1 &lt; 0 at the upper bound of H in (4). Therefore, by continuity, there is at least one 1H such that</p><p>Hence, there must be only one such 1H .</p><p>Let z be one of the other parameters, z ∈ s h S . Now when</p><p>1H is increasing in z; if a small change in z increases the additional profits from an EHA, then H must be higher to make H 1 indifferent again. The reverse is true if</p><p>= 0 to verify the remainder of the proposition.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 2. We verify numerically that there is a cost-raising effect, that it is larger than the variety effect, and that H 1 's wholesale price is higher. We note that H 1 's market share must be lower than under the nonexclusive regime when H = 1H because its wholesale price is higher but the profits are the same as in the nonexclusive regime. We verify numerically that H 1 's market share when it is exclusive is decreasing in H . Finally, we verify numerically that at the lower bound for H in (4), H 1 's market share is higher than in the nonexclusive regime only if s is sufficiently small, h is sufficiently large, or S is sufficiently large.</p></div>
