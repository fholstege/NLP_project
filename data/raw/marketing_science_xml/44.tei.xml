<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To study consumer brand misinformation, we run in-store blind taste tests with a retailer's private label food brands and the leading national brand counterparts in three large consumer packaged goods categories. Subjects self-report very high expectations about the quality of the private labels relative to national brands. However, they predict a relatively low probability of choosing them in a blind taste test. An overwhelming majority systematically choose the private label in the blinded test. Using program evaluation methods, we find that the causal effect of this intervention on treated consumers increases their market share for the tested private label product by 15 share points during the week after the intervention, on top of a base share of 8 share points. However, the effect diminishes to 8 share points during the second to fourth weeks after the test and to 2 share points during the second to fifth months after the test. Using a structural model of demand that controls for the self-selected participation and allows for heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that these effects survive controls for point-of-purchase prices, purchase incidence, and the feedback effects of brand loyalty. We also find that the intervention increases the preference for the private label brands, and that it decreases the preference for the national brands, relative to the outside good. Interpreting the intervention as an information treatment about the product, we find evidence consistent with an economically large informational barrier on demand for the private label product relative to an established national brand.</p><p>History: Avi Goldfarb served as the senior editor and Paul Ellickson served as associate editor for this article.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Private label brands in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry are still relatively underdeveloped in the United States relative to other Western economies. According to a 2014 global Nielsen survey, private labels accounted for only 18% of U.S. CPG sales, which is comparable to the weighted global average of 16.5% but much smaller than shares exceeding 40% in European countries like the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Spain. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In Europe, private labels represent $1 of every $3 spent on CPG. In spite of the spending gap between the United States and Europe, survey evidence suggests that there is no gap in private label quality perceptions: 75% of U.S. respondents agreed with the statement "Private Labels are a good alternative to name brands." In Europe, the rate is comparable at 69%. In spite of perceptions, U.S. consumers routinely pay a large price premium for national brands. Recent research finds that U.S. consumers could save $44 billion annually by switching to a comparable store brand when available <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bronnenberg et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>We investigate the extent to which U.S. consumers' willingness-to-pay a CPG brand price premium relative to private label alternatives is driven by an information barrier. In cooperation with Mariano's, a large Midwestern supermarket chain, we conduct a series of in-store blind taste tests that match the chain's private label products against the leading national brand competitors in several CPG categories. Mariano's carries a high-quality line of private label products using the private label "Roundy's," along with a premium line of private label products under the private label "Roundy's Select." Prior to sampling the products, subjects are asked several questions regarding their private label beliefs. After the blind taste test, when the identities of the sampled products are revealed, subjects self-report their future purchase intentions for the private label. Each participant sampled products from only one category: cookies (Roundy's O's versus Oreos), Greek yogurt (Roundy's Greek versus Chobani), or Ice cream (Roundy's Select versus Breyers). These product categories exhibit a substantial national brand price premium (36.6% in cookies, 19.7% in Greek yogurt, and 24.8% in ice cream). To measure a treatment effect of the blind taste test, the survey responses are matched to each subject's loyalty card account so that national brand and private label purchases can be tracked, within-consumer, before and after the in-store intervention.</p><p>Since participation in the in-store blind taste test and survey is voluntary, our treatment sample could be self-selected on unobserved aspects of consumer brand preferences and brand information. To resolve the self-selection, we exploit the panel structure of our data and apply a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to obtain a consistent estimate of the average causal effect of the blind taste test on the treated consumers. We use time stamps on consumers' transactions to construct a "control group" of consumers who shopped in the store-day of the blind taste tests. We then compare within-household changes in private label purchasing behavior on trips 150 days before and 157 days after the date of the blind taste test for our test and control consumers.</p><p>Our key identifying assumption consists of the usual parallel trends condition. We validate our test and control design using the pretest purchase panel data, finding little systematic differences in preferences for test and control consumers and no evidence of nonparallel trends. We also show that the estimated treatment effect of the blind taste test is robust to an alternative matrix completion estimator that relaxes the parallel trends assumption and allows for a broad class of heterogeneous unobserved trends.</p><p>We begin with an analysis of the survey data. Across the three categories, 81% of participants agreed that, overall, Mariano's "Roundy's" private label is as good as the national brands. Surprisingly, only 44% of participants predicted they would pick the private label over the national brand in the blind taste test. However, 72% of participants preferred the Roundy's private label immediately after the blind taste test (but before revealing the identities of brands), which is much higher than pure chance. Finally, after the identity of the chosen product was revealed, 84% of participants predicted that they would buy the Roundy's private label next time they shopped in the category they sampled.</p><p>Our DID estimates indicate a large initial impact of the blind taste test on purchases. During the week after the blind taste test, the pooled private label share for test consumers increased by 15 percentage points on a base of 8 percentage points. This effect is much larger than the usual advertising effects from traditional media like television. The effect size varies considerably across the three categories: 48 share points in cookies, 22 share points in ice cream, and 10 share points in Greek yogurt. After the first week, the treatment effect declines. During the period spanning 1-4 weeks after the test, the pooled treatment effect across categories falls to 8 share points. During the period spanning 1-5 months after the test, the pooled treatment effect across categories falls to 2 share points. The latter still represents a quarter of the initial private label share. These findings are qualitatively unchanged when we rerun our analysis at the weekly level using a matrix completion estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Athey et al. 2017</ref>) that relaxes the parallel trends assumption.</p><p>An analysis of the valence effects suggest that the information conveyed by the blind taste test is not merely generating a salience effect, in contrast with traditional promotional tools like in-aisle displays. In particular, the treatment effect is much larger for subjects that derived a positive signal from the taste test, suggesting an informative role of the blind taste test. The persistence in the effect of the intervention indicates that the blind taste test is generating more than an instantaneous promotional effect. Finally, even if we exclude the day of the intervention, we still find a large treatment effect during the first week suggesting a carryover effect of the intervention into subsequent trips.</p><p>A limitation of the DID estimates is that they do not allow for heterogeneity in the treatment effect and they do not control for prices, purchase incidence, the presence of other substitute brands in the category that were not sampled in the blind taste test, and the potentially confounding role of purchase reinforcement through brand loyalty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Givon and Horsky 1990)</ref>. We estimate a random coefficients choice model to control for these various factors in the Greek yogurt category, which we selected because of its relatively high purchase incidence. Our random coefficients analysis focuses on the largest brands in the category.</p><p>We find that, once we control for heterogeneity, we reject a model with brand loyalty (i.e., inertia) in favor of one without. We therefore conclude that any persistence in the effect of the blind taste test is not <ref type="bibr">Sanders: Consumer Misinformation and</ref><ref type="bibr">the Brand Premium Marketing Science, 2020, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 382-406, ¬© 2020 The Author(s)</ref> merely picking up the indirect feedback effect of brand loyalty. Our main finding regarding the short-, medium-, and long-run treatment effects of the blind taste test are robust to the various controls. We also find that the blind taste test increases the consumer preference for the private label and decreases the utility for the tested national brand.</p><p>To assess the role of our informational intervention, we use the structural estimates to simulate the counterfactual scenario in which all consumers visiting the store participate in the blind taste test. We predict that such a policy would generate a large initial outward shift in private label demand, ceteris paribus. But, over time (1-5 months post-test), the demand shift would weaken, converging back toward the initial pretreatment levels. These findings suggest that the one-time information treatment may not be sufficient to overwhelm the persistent effects of brand capital documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bronnenberg et al. 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bronnenberg et al. 2012</ref>. However, the effect is more than seven times larger than the current trend in the growth of the CPG private label share in the United States (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dub√© et al. 2018)</ref>, suggesting that established brands create substantial information barriers to entry.</p><p>Our findings add to the extant literature on the role of consumer information and consumer willingnessto-pay for branded goods (see the survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bronnenberg et al. 2019)</ref>. Earlier work has found that product knowledge and domain expertise are associated with private label purchases. Pharmacists are considerably more likely to buy private label headache medicines, and chefs are considerably more likely to buy private label pantry staples <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bronnenberg et al. 2015)</ref>. However, it is unclear whether policies that directly communicate objective product information to consumers have a material impact on their brand choices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bollinger et al. (2011)</ref> find that calorie posting nudges consumers toward healthier product choices, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jin and Leslie (2003)</ref> find that restaurant hygiene report cards lead more demand for clean restaurants and a larger supply of high-hygiene restaurants. In contrast, in the CPG industry, consumers still tend to pick a higherpriced national CPG brand even when they are told that the private label is objectively comparable in quality <ref type="bibr">(Cox et al. 1983, Carrera and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Villas-Boas 2015)</ref>. Similarly, in the automobile industry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allcott and Knittel (2019)</ref> find that providing consumers with fuel economy information does not affect consumer car purchases. We find that providing consumers with their own, subjective CPG food information has a long lasting, yet largely transient, effect on their private label purchases.</p><p>Our findings also add to the broader literature on branding as a barrier to entry in consumer goods markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bain 1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Schmalensee 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Bronnenberg et al. 2012</ref>. The survey results indicate that consumers underestimate their likelihood of choosing the private label in a blind taste test, in spite of their stated belief that the private label brands are as good as the national brands. In contrast with most of the structural learning literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Erdem and</ref><ref type="bibr">Keane 1996, Ackerberg 2003)</ref>, we find that the information effect erodes over time and purchase behavior reverts back toward the pretest purchase rates, possibly because of forgetting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mehta et al. 2004</ref>). These findings are consistent with a small theoretical literature on free sampling that also allows for forgetting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Heiman et al. 2001</ref>). The decline is also consistent with the empirical advertising literature in which advertising is found to have a persistent effect on demand that decays slowly over time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Clarke 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Assmus et al. 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Dub√© et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Sahni 2015</ref>); although our blind taste test generates a much larger effect on demand than impressions from traditional advertising media.</p><p>Finally, our findings contribute to the managerial literature on free samples and nonprice promotions. Price promotions, like coupons, are typically only found to have short-term direct effects on consumer purchases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klein 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Irons et al. 1983</ref>, with any longer-term effects typically arising through purchase feedback (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gedenk and Neslin 1999)</ref>. The findings on nonprice promotions are more mixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gedenk and Neslin (1999)</ref> find either no effect or purely a purchase feedback effect from nonprice promotions like feature ads and sampling. We explicitly test for and reject purchase feedback, finding a direct long-term effect from the blind taste tests, similar to the long-term effects in the study of free sampling campaigns by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bawa and Shoemaker (2004)</ref>. Unlike past studies of free samples, we explicitly treat our consumer subjects with information about their subjective taste for branded versus private label goods. The information treatment changed the beliefs of many consumers regarding the perceived quality gap between national brand and private labels.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the blind taste test and the data used in this study. Section 3 reports on survey findings. Next, Section 4 discusses the results of our DID analysis, and Section 5 explains the structural model and analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>The data originate from a partnership with Roundy's, the parent company of several midwestern supermarket chains. We use data from the "Mariano's" chain, located in Cook County, Illinois. The database comprises three sources: (1) transaction-level data collected through shoppers' loyalty cards, (2) stockkeeping unit (SKU)-level data tracking daily price and product availability data by store, and (3) the instore beliefs and preference survey conducted during our blind taste test. We now describe each data set in detail.</p><p>Bronnenberg, Dub√©, and Sanders: Consumer Misinformation and the Brand Premium 2.1. Loyalty Card Data First, we collected transaction-level data through Mariano's loyalty card database. The data span the 57-month period from July 2010 (the opening of the first Mariano's store in Arlington Heights, Illinois) to March 2015. They include 70,635,896 transactions, time-stamped by day, hour, and minute, and comprise 1,329,900 unique customers and 29 unique Mariano's stores. We retain the UPC-level purchase information for our three categories of interest: (shelf-stable) cookies, ice cream, and yogurt. The purchase data include the panelist's unique loyalty card number, the quantity of each UPC purchased, the price paid net of discounts, the trip date, and the unique store number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Store-Level Data</head><p>We also obtained a store-level database tracking the weekly shelf prices and product availability of each of the UPCs in our three categories of interest: (shelfstable) cookies, ice cream, and yogurt. The data span 29 stores, 3,301 UPCs, and the time period between July 2010 and April 2015.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Blind Taste Test Survey Data</head><p>The blind taste tests were conducted at the end of October 2014. For each of the three categories, between 10 and 16 separate blind taste test sessions were conducted. In a given store-day, there was never more than one tested category. In total, the blind taste tests spanned five stores 2 across 8 days. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the date and location of each of the 36 sessions. A given session typically lasted 6 hours and resulted in 3-82 respondents. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> During a session, a "free samples" table was manned by a trained sales associate near the main entrance of the store. The associate used a preprogrammed tablet device to administer the survey and to record responses. Mariano's management trained each sales associate regarding how to use the tablet device and how to administer the survey. Each participant was first asked to swipe her loyalty card. The participant was then asked to answer yes/no to the question: "Do you think Roundy's branded food products are at least as good as their national brand counter-parts?" After answering, the sales associate explained which two products the participant would sample. Before sampling, the participant was asked to answer a second yes/no question: "Do you think you will prefer [own brand being tested] or [national brand being tested]?" Depending on the session, the participant compared either Roundy's O's and Oreos (cookies), Roundy's Greek and Chobani (Greek yogurt), or Roundy's Select and Breyers (ice cream). The Mariano's employee offered the participant samples of the private label and branded good with the product identities masked. The participant was then asked to answer a third question: "Which product did you prefer?" At this point, the identity of the selected product was revealed to the participant. Finally, the participant was asked a fourth yes/no question: "Next time you shop for (product category being tested), will you buy (own brand being tested)?"</p><p>In total, we collected 1,228 responses from 1,119 unique card holders who participated in 1 of the 36 blind taste test sessions listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For each unique card holder, we retained the first response (in case of multiple household members participating in the same in-store test) or a randomly determined response (in case of an exact minute tie) of the first test (in case of participation in multiple in-store tests) for our analysis. Our final treatment sample therefore contains 1,119 responses and unique card holders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Estimation Sample</head><p>For our analysis, we focus on the population of shoppers who shopped in one of our five test stores on a date during which we ran one of the blind taste test sessions listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We then define our sample period as the 150 days prior to the blind taste test and the 157 days following the blind taste test that we have at our disposal. We observe panelist shopping data as early as 2010, when the first Mariano's stores opened in Chicago. However, we only use the 150 days prior to the taste test to mitigate the potentially confounding effects of changing tastes over time. In total, we retain 16,684 unique customers who make 211,810 unique transactions within the three categories studied across all 29 stores during the time period of interest. We match households' blind taste test responses with pre-and postintervention purchase data using their unique loyalty card number. Among the 1,119 consumers who participated in a blind taste test, 440 (39%) can be matched to purchase data of the varieties they tasted (e.g., Greek yogurt). Of these 440 participants, 99 sampled Oreo-style cookies, 156 sampled Greek yogurt, and 185 sampled ice cream. These panelists represent the test sample for our analysis. For our control sample, we use all panelists who (a) shopped on the same day and location as the 36 blind taste test sessions, (b) did not participate in the test itself, and (c) purchase in the tested categories. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> In total, we have 16,244 unique control panelists.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> provides descriptive statistics of our final estimation sample. For each of the control and test groups, we report the unique number of panelists, the total number of transactions, and the average number of transactions per panelist. We also report the average private label share, computed as the average share of purchases by volume in the time period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Estimation Sample for Structural Analysis</head><p>For the structural analysis, we assemble a choice panel from the Greek yogurt category that allows us to control for prices, product availability, and other point-of-purchase factors. We focus on the Greek yogurt category because of the relatively high purchase rate.</p><p>We define the Greek yogurt market as the top-selling SKUs of Greek-labeled yogurt sold at Mariano's stores during our sample period. We construct these SKUs using the store-level data described above. A SKU consists of the combination of UPCs with the same brand and pack size and with coordinated pricing.</p><p>We then retain the six top-selling SKUs, all of which are single-serving sized and which represent 60.3% of the total volume of Greek yogurt sold during our sample period: Chobani, Dannon, Fage, Roundy's, Noosa, and Yoplait. A SKU's price in a given storeday consists of the average price across the UPCs available for that SKU on the same store-day. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> lists each of our SKUs used for the structural analysis. For each SKU, we list the brand name and each of the underlying UPCs included. We also report the average shelf price and the average share of Greek yogurt volume sold across all stores and days during the entire estimation sample period.</p><p>In contrast with the DID results, we use a longer pretreatment window of 1 year (365 days), to improve the precision of our estimates of heterogeneity. In Appendix C, we report estimates for a 150-day pretreatment window that conforms with the DID analysis. Our findings do not change qualitatively with the shorter window.</p><p>We merge the SKU data with our transaction data by store and date. We only retain those panelists that shopped in one of our test stores on a day during which one of the Greek yogurt blind taste tests was fielded, and those weeks corresponding to our estimation sample period (365 days prior to the test and 149 after the test). A retained panelist must purchase Greek yogurt at least once during the sample period. In total, we observe 259 test panelists that make 21,869 trips across the 29 stores during the sample period. We also observe 10,837 control panelists that make 827,995 trips across the 29 stores during the sample period. For each observed trip, we track the chosen item (if one of our Greek yogurt SKUs was purchased) along with the entire choice set including available SKUs on that trip and their respective prices. If none of the six SKUs is chosen, we classify the trip as a "no purchase" occasion. Effectively, we have defined an "outside good." This outside good is chosen on 93.7% of the trips during the entire sample period.</p><p>Greek yogurt purchases appear to satisfy the "discrete choice" assumption since 91.3% of the purchase trips result in the purchase of a single SKU. We dropped the remaining trips that involved purchasing multiple brands.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> summarizes the unconditional and conditional (on purchase) shares for the test and control groups. Chobani is the top-selling product in the category, with 35% of sales. Roundy's private label Greek yogurt is the lowest-share brand with only 4.5% of the market share. We observe some selfselection into the test sample. Our test panelists are more likely to buy Roundy's (7.8% versus 4.4% in control) and Noosa (28.8% versus 14.0% in control), but they are less likely to buy Chobani (28.5% versus 34.8% in control).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Survey Findings</head><p>We now summarize the main descriptive results of the blind taste test survey. The survey consisted of four questions regarding panelists' beliefs about the private label brand in the three categories tested (Oreostyle cookies, Greek yogurt, and ice cream), with two questions asked before and two after the blind taste test. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> provides summary statistics for the responses from the 664 subjects that make at least one purchase from the tested categories during the sample period.</p><p>A total of 81% of our sample responded affirmatively to question one regarding private label quality in general (Q1): "Do you think Roundy's branded food products are as good as their national brand counterpart?" However, only 44% of our sample responded affirmatively to question two (Q2): "Do you think you will prefer Roundy's [product] or [competitor brand product]?" <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The large difference in responses between Q1 and Q2 is surprising since it seems to suggest subjects do not trust their own beliefs about private label quality in general. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> It is even more striking that 72% of the sample responded affirmatively to question three (Q3): "Did you prefer Roundy's <ref type="bibr">[product]</ref> or <ref type="bibr">[competitor brand product]</ref>?" The actual choice rate in Q3 was 28 percentage points higher than the predicted choice rate in Q2. After the identity of the chosen brand was revealed to subjects, 84% of the sample responded affirmatively to question four (Q4): "Next time you shop for cookies, will you buy Roundy's private label O's cookie?" The predicted purchase intention is 13 percentage points higher than the choice rate in Q3, and 41 percentage points higher than the predicted choice rate in Q2.</p><p>The results are robust to a more micro analysis of the three individual categories. Although not reported in further detail, the category-specific survey responses mimic the findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> qualitatively. The findings are also robust to using only the subjects who buy from the tested varieties or subcategories (i.e., the sample of the DID analysis in the next section containing 440 subjects) and to using the full sample of 1,119 subjects.</p><p>The high response to Q1 could represent misinformation but could also reflect an acquiescence bias whereby respondents simply provided the affirmative answer to please the surveyor. Also, the sharp increase in stated future private label purchase intention in Q4 relative to the predicted purchase in Q3 is consistent with an information effect, but could also reflect a salience effect or a choice-supportive  bias from subjects who had just selected the private label in the blind taste test component.</p><p>As preliminary evidence of an information effect, we now study the impact of the valence of the information conveyed by the blind taste test. The response to Q2 reveals aspects of a subject's prior belief about her relative preference for Roundy's versus the corresponding national brand. The comparison of a subject's response to Q2 and Q3 indicates the sign of the information signal provided to the subject from the blind taste test. For instance, a subject who predicted choosing the national brand on Q2 and who chose the private label on Q3 received a positive signal about the private label brand. We now analyze whether the impact of the blind taste test on choice is moderated by the sign of the information signal. A limitation of this exercise is that we cannot randomly assign subjects to information treatments. Therefore, the sign of the information signal is self-selected on a panelist's tastes and our findings should be interpreted purely as correlational.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> gives the results. From the table, we observe that among all shoppers who thought that they would not prefer the private label brand before the taste test (N 375), 64% chose the private label in the blind taste test and, accordingly, received a positive signal about the private label. In contrast, among those who did think that they would prefer the private label brand (N 289), only 18% chose the national brand in the blind taste test and, accordingly, received a negative signal about the private label. Taken at face value, our results are suggestive that the probability of deriving a positive signal conditional on having a negative prior is much higher than the probability of deriving a negative signal conditional on having a positive prior.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> shows the association between the signal derived from the taste test and the stated intention to purchase private label on the next purchase occasion. The table is structured to facilitate contrasts between households who hold the same pretest beliefs but who differ in their posttest beliefs. In particular, looking at the first two rows, holding the pretest stated preference for the private label brand constant at a high level (Q 2 1), 69% (N 52) of consumers who updated negatively (Q 3 0) indicated the intention to buy the private label next time. However, among those who remained positive (Q 3 1; N 237), a strongly contrasting 95% indicated they would buy the private label next time. Holding, in rows 3 and 4, the pretest stated preference for the private label brand constant at a lower level (Q 2 0), among all who thought initially they would not prefer the private label brand and continued to do so (Q 3 0; N 136), 51% claim to buy the private label brand on a next occasion, whereas, among those who updated positively (Q 3 1; N 239), 96% indicated the intention to buy the private label next time, almost doubling the intent to buy the private label. In sum, holding constant initial beliefs, the taste test resulted in updated beliefs that are strongly correlated to the intent to buy private label in the future.</p><p>In the next section, we use subjects' actual purchase behavior after the date of the blind taste test to  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Method</head><p>We use the shopping data described in Section 2.4 to estimate the causal effect of the blind taste test on panelists' private label choices. Our identification strategy relies on the panel structure of our transaction data. We use a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model to compare the differences in shopping behavior, before versus after the test dates, between our participants in the taste tests and all other shoppers in the test store on the same date. This difference-in-differences approach controls for time-invariant confounders with the treatment using consumer fixed effects, and common time confounders using time fixed effects. Let h 1, . . . , H denote panelists, each with a unique individual loyalty card, and let c 1, . . . , C denote the product categories. We index the panelist's trip dates by t ‚àíT hb , . . . , 0, . . . , T he , where t 0 indicates the date of the blind taste test, T hb is the total number of days between the first observed trip for h and the date of the test, and T he is the total number of days elapsed between the date of the test and the last observed trip. Let œÑ hct ‚àà 0, 1 { } indicate whether panelist h was "treated" in category c prior to or on date t, meaning that she participated in the blind taste testi.e., œÑ hct ‚â° I {treatment group,t‚â•0} . Also, let œÑ hc (without a time subscript) indicate whether panelist h is ever "treated" in the duration of our panel. Let Y hct ‚àà 0, 1 { } indicate whether panelist h buys the private label in category c, conditional on making a category purchase on date t. Using the familiar potential outcomes framework, for each individual h and time period t, we are interested in the potential outcomes Y hct œÑ hct ( ).</p><p>Our empirical goal consists of obtaining an estimate of the average treatment effect of the blind taste test for a given category c on the treated units and time periods:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ATT c E Y hct 1 ( ) ‚àí Y hct (0)|œÑ hct 1 ( ) E Y hct 1 ( )|œÑ hct 1 ( ) ‚àí E Y hct (0)|œÑ hct 1 ( ) . (1)</formula><p>As with most settings, the challenge is that we do not observe Y hct 0 ( )|œÑ hct 1 (</p><p>) . In addition, the nonrandom assignment of treatment means that some consumers may self-select into the treatment condition, in part, based on their heterogeneous treatment effects.</p><p>We use a standard two-way fixed-effects estimator of ATT c based on the DID between treated and untreated households. In particular, we use a linear probability model to predict a panelist's choice between the private label and the tested national brand in a category c on trip date t, conditional on purchase:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y hct Œ± hc + Œ≥ tc + Œ≤ SR,c ‚Ä¢ œÑ htc ‚Ä¢ I t‚àà 0,6 ( ) { } + Œ≤ MR,c ‚Ä¢ œÑ htc ‚Ä¢ I t‚àà 7,27 ( ) { } + Œ≤ LR,c ‚Ä¢ œÑ htc ‚Ä¢ I t&gt;27 { } + Œµ htc.</formula><p>(2)</p><p>The parameter Œ± hc is a panelist-category fixed effect, Œ≥ tc is a category-week fixed effect, 7 and the indicator variables I t‚ààT { } denote whether trip date t falls in the time interval T , measured in days. The parameters {Œ≤ SR , Œ≤ MR , Œ≤ LR } capture the average treatment effect of the blind taste test on the propensity to buy a private label versus a national brand, conditional on purchase. We allow the ATT to vary with the duration of time elapsed since the date of the in-store taste test: a short-run effect of the taste test during the first 7 days after the test (Œ≤ SR ), a medium-run effect of the taste test during the time interval between 7 days and 27 days after the test (Œ≤ MR ), and a long-run effect of the taste test during the time interval between 28 days and 157 days after the test (Œ≤ LR ). We also report a version of Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) that splits the long-run effect, Œ≤ LR , into separate 4-week treatment effects, (Œ≤ 4-8 weeks , Œ≤ 9-12 weeks , Œ≤ 13-16 weeks , Œ≤ &gt;16 weeks ).</p><p>The consistency of our DID estimator of {Œ≤ SR , Œ≤ MR , Œ≤ LR } relies on exogeneity: E(Œµ hc |Œ± hc , Œ≥ tc , œÑ htc ) 0. The consumer fixed-effects control for self-selection on unobserved, time-invariant factors. Second, the inclusion of time fixed effects that are common across consumers implicitly assumes that treated and untreated households follow parallel trends. In the potential outcomes framework, this implicit assumption can be stated as follows (e.g., Abadie <ref type="formula">2005</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E Y htc 0 ( ) ‚àí Y ht c 0 ( )|œÑ hc 1 ( ) E Y htc 0 ( ) ‚àí Y ht c 0 ( )|œÑ hc 0 (</formula><p>) , where t t .</p><p>(3) Condition ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) assumes that any changes in Y htc over time are independent of whether a household participated in the blind taste test.</p><p>A recent literature has demonstrated that, in general, the TWFE can exhibit bias and may not estimate the ATT when the timing of treatment is staggered across consumers(e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Athey and Imbens 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Goodman-Bacon 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Imai and Kim 2019</ref>. These biases are unlikely to be large in our setting where all of the treated panelists received treatment within an 8-day window and the treatment was administered once only in a given category. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Therefore, the DID will generate the ATT of interest in our setting.</p><p>While we cannot directly test the parallel trends assumption (3), we can follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angrist and</ref><ref type="bibr">Krueger (1999, p. 1299)</ref> to exploit the long time series in our panel data and test for parallel trends during the pretreatment period. First, we conduct a direct pretreatment test for parallel trends by estimating Y htc Œ± hc + Œ¥ c t + œâ c tI {treatment group} + Œµ htc , t &lt; 0, (4) using all panelists during the pretreatment period. The parameter Œ¥ c is the common trend and œâ c is a deviation from the common trend for the treatment group. Results are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> for a pretreatment window of 150 days-that is, T hb ‚â§ 150. The common trend is small, relative to the 7.8% baseline private label share, and statistically insignificant. Of interest is the null hypothesis of parallel trends: H 0 : œâ c 0. We fail to reject the null of parallel trends, with an economically small predicted mean difference of only 0.04 percentage points. However, the results are imprecise, and we cannot rule out with a high degree of confidence that the treatment group trend is as much as 0.20 percentage points lower. This finding is robust to the use of alternative pretreatment window lengths as long as 1 year. With a 1-year window length, we do reject the null of equal trends at the 5% significance level; but the difference in the weekly trend size remains small at 0.091%. 9 In Section 4.3, we will check the robustness of our ATT estimates to an estimator that uses a weaker assumption than parallel trends. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Our tests appear to support the assumption of parallel trends. This evidence in conjunction with the panelist-specific fixed effects should ensure the consistency of our DID estimates of the treatment effect from the blind taste tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Estimated Treatment Effects</head><p>We now focus on the DID estimates using the linear probabilities model in Equation (2). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref> presents the estimates for the DID regressions. We observe that the base share of the private label across the three categories ranges from 4.0% (Greek yogurt) to 19.1% (ice cream). Pooled across categories, panelists, and purchase occasions, the baseline probability of buying the private label brand is 7.9%.</p><p>In the first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref>, we pool the three categories and allow for a common treatment effect. We find that during the week after the blind taste test, the short-run purchase probability of the private label brand increases by 15.1 percentage points to 23.0%, although we cannot rule out an increase as small as 11.3 percentage points at the 5% significance level. The blind taste test thus tripled the market share of the private label in the short run. We also find a large and significant short-run effect of the category-specific treatment effects reported in second, third, and fourth columns.</p><p>Pooling across categories, we find that between 7 and 27 days after the blind taste test, the medium-run purchase probability is still 7.8 percentage points larger than before the test, doubling the baseline purchase probability of 7.9%, although we cannot rule out an increase as small as 4.4 percentage points at the 5% significance level. Therefore, the pooled Bronnenberg, Dub√©, and Sanders: Consumer Misinformation and the Brand Premium treatment effect declines relative to the short-run effect. Pooling across categories, the difference between the short-and medium-run effects is large enough that we can reject the null hypothesis that they are the same. The numerical difference between the short-and medium-run effects is large for each individual category. However, the difference is not always significant because of the limited sample sizes in specific categories.</p><p>During the four-month period starting 28 days after the test, the pooled (across categories) private label share is still 2.3 percentage points higher than during the pretreatment period, although we cannot rule out that it is as small as 0.8 percentage points at the 5% significance level. Hence, the treatment effect of the in-store blind taste test declines further over time, albeit more slowly over a five-month period. Still, compared with the baseline purchase probability of 7.9%, the taste test increases the relative share of the private label by 29% in the long run. In the pooled analysis, we reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the medium-and long-run effects. These differences are also significant in the category level analysis for Greek yogurt.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref> decomposes the long-term treatment effect by allowing for separate consecutive 4-week effects. The first column indicates that the pooled treatment effect across categories decays from over time. The effect becomes statistically insignificant after eight weeks. Even though after 16 weeks the treatment effect is insignificant in all three categories, we cannot rule out effects as large as several percentage points at the 5% significance level.</p><p>As a robustness check, Appendix A reports the treatment effects using only the difference (before versus after treatment) within the treatment group.</p><p>A time trend, identified from the pretreatment data, controls for a constant trend in the pre-period and post-period. The results in Tables A.1 and A.2 confirm the estimates of the DID analysis above. The larger effect sizes in these robustness checks, especially for the long run, highlight the importance of the two-way fixed effect specification used above. The DID approach uses the untreated group to identify posttreatment time effects that might otherwise generate spurious treatment effects.</p><p>We conduct three additional robustness checks. For brevity, these are reported for the pooled data only, corresponding to the first column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>. First, we check the sensitivity of our results to the definition of the short-run time interval. A concern is that, in addition to communicating product information, the in-store free samples booth may simply create a shortrun salience effect, similar to standard in-store promotions like in-aisle or end-of-aisle displays. We reestimate the DID regression dropping treated panelists who bought from the test category on the same day as the taste test. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> compares the predicted private label share level when households who buy from the category of interest at the test day are retained (as before) versus excluded. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> indeed suggests a "day of the test" effect that might be capturing the salience effect of the sampling booth on choice. The figure shows that once we drop households who buy from the category on the test day, our point estimate for the short-run effect falls by several percentage points and we fail to reject the hypothesis that short-and medium-run effects are the same (the lower sample size from subsetting the data also generates a noisier estimate of the short-run effect). Importantly, however, we continue to find a persistent  treatment effect after the date of the test even among those who do not buy on the test day.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Panelist √ó category fixed effects ‚àíŒ± hc X X X X Week √ó category fixed effects ‚àíŒ≥ tc X X X X H 0 : Œ≤ SR Œ≤ MR Reject Reject H 0 : Œ≤ MR Œ≤ LR Reject Reject N 211,</formula><p>As a second robustness check, we check the sensitivity of our results to the definition of the three categories and present the results from using the subcategories (Oreo-style cookies, ice cream, and Greek yogurt) as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref> along with the results when using the purchases in the broader categories (cookies, ice cream and frozen yogurt, and yogurt) used in the blind taste test. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> compares the results for each of the two category definitions. The short-run effect appears to be robust across the two definitions. However, our point estimate for the medium-run effect is several percentage points smaller when we use the entire category (this difference is statistically significant). This finding is not surprising since the broader category definition includes product varieties that were not explicitly tested even though they use the same brand names as those in the test. Most important, we continue to find a statistically significant effect in the medium run and long run under both definitions.</p><p>As a final robustness check, we check the sensitivity of our results to the length of the pretreatment window.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>.

(2017)</ref>. As explained earlier, one of the key identification assumption underlying our DID estimates in Section 4.2 is that treatment and control consumers' purchases follow parallel trends.

Accordingly, this problem is termed matrix completion with nuclear norm minimization (MC-NNM) because the objective consists of estimating the components of the matrices U and V above. We refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Athey et al. 2017</ref> for technical details and note that, like them, we do not regularize the fixed effects to ensure that we control for time-invariant heterogeneity and common time shocks.

Indeed, the same general findings emerge as those in our primary specification in Section 4. We find a significant and large effect of the blind taste test on private label purchase likelihood that then decays over time to a smaller, but economically meaningful, long-run point estimate. The robustness of these findings to the methods in this section suggest our initial results were not merely spurious, as would have been the case had they been identified off unmodeled deviations in the time trends between the control and treatment group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Valence of Information</head><p>We now explore the potential information content of the treatment effect. A novel aspect of our data is that we surveyed panel members about their preference for the private label relative to the national brand before and after the blind taste test. Within panelist, this format allows us to measure the moderating effect of the valence of the subjective information from the blind taste test on the treatment effect. Panelist fixed effects allow us to control for the potential self-selection into a positive versus negative initial state.</p><p>We use the stated preference, elicited immediately before and after the blind taste test to measure the sign of the information signal conveyed by the free samples. If a panelist predicted she would prefer the national brand and then stated she preferred the private label after the taste test, we classify the information as a positive update. If the panelist predicted she would prefer the private label and still does so after the test, we classify the information as positive confirmation. Similarly, we define a negative update as a predicted preference for the private Bronnenberg, Dub√©, and Sanders: Consumer Misinformation and the Brand Premium label and a preference for the national brand after the taste test. Finally, if the panelist predicted she would prefer the national brand and still does so after the taste test, we classify this information as negative confirmation.</p><p>We rerun the DID regressions in (2) with a single average (over time) treatment effect and an interaction between the treatment effect and the valence of the information:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Y hct Œ± hc + Œ≥ ct + Œ≤ neg‚Üípos ‚Ä¢ œÑ hc ‚Ä¢ I t‚â•0 { } + Œ≤ pos‚Üíneg ‚Ä¢ œÑ hc ‚Ä¢ I t‚â•0 { } + Œ≤ pos‚Üípos ‚Ä¢ œÑ hc ‚Ä¢ I t‚â•0 { } + Œ≤ neg‚Üíneg ‚Ä¢ œÑ hc ‚Ä¢ I t‚â•0 { } + Œµ hct .</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref> presents the results against the baseline of the average treatment effect over the entire post-test time window. In the column labeled "Baseline," we confirm that the blind taste test has a large positive impact on the probability to purchase a private label over a branded product in the three categories tested.</p><p>The propensity to buy private label increases from 7.6% to 12.0%, a larger than 50% increase. Moving to the column labeled "Valence," we find that the positive treatment effect is concentrated among those who have positive evaluations of the private label after the taste test: those panelists that update their preference for the private label positively and those that confirm their positive prior disposition. For those who update negatively on the private label, the point estimate for the effect of the blind taste test is negative yet insignificant. We cannot rule out a negative treatment effect on the private label choice propensity as large as -10.7 percentage points or a positive effect as large as 0.5 percentage points at the 5% significance level. Finally, for those who remain negative about the private label brand we fail to reject a null effect, although we cannot rule out an effect as small as -2.1 percentage points or as large as 3.9 percentage points at the 5% level. These findings   <ref type="bibr">, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 382-406, ¬© 2020</ref> suggest that the blind taste test impacts mostly those participants who derive a positive signal from the experience, although we cannot rule out a negative treatment effect for those participants who derived a negative signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Structural Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Overview</head><p>Using program evaluation methods above, we documented strong and persistent treatment effects of the blind taste tests on the treated consumers. These findings indicate that subjective product information can change a consumer's reliance on brand to make purchase decisions. Ultimately, we would like to quantify the extent to which such information affects the overall market structure of the category. Thus, we would like to predict the counterfactual effect of treating all consumers with the blind taste test, which we will interpret as information.</p><p>The policy simulation is complicated by the fact that participation in the blind taste test is voluntary and may be self-selected on unobserved aspects of tastes. Self-selection was handled using a fixed-effects approach in our DID and MC estimators. However, in this section we develop a structural choice model in which we estimate the distribution of heterogeneity, including for the treatment effects of the blind taste test. Because correlation of these components with the treatment assignment can create an endogeneity bias, our structural model includes the selection decision. We use the estimates to predict the treatment effect on the untreated consumers and evaluate a counterfactual exercise in which all consumers become informed (i.e., as if all consumers participate in the blind taste test).</p><p>In addition to measuring the impact of information on market structure, a structural choice model also allows us to test for a number of potentially confounding factors that could not easily be addressed by the DID analysis. The DID approach in Section 4 focused on the binary outcome of private label choice conditional on purchase. It did not consider the specific brand choice alternatives or the no-purchase option. In addition, the DID estimator did not control for several potential confounding factors including variation across trips in the set of available brands in the category and/or the products' prices. Moreover, while the DID approach is robust to heterogeneity, it does not provide a characterization of the heterogeneity in the treatment effect. Since we expect consumers to have different degrees of experience and information with the various brands and the private label, we anticipate heterogeneity in the amount of information conveyed by the taste test and therefore in its effect size. To account for the role of causal factors like the choice set, prices, and the role of consumer heterogeneity, we fit a random coefficients logit demand system to the transaction panel data.</p><p>A final concern is that any persistence in the treatment effect of the blind taste test could be identified spuriously from omitted state dependence in demand, or "purchase feedback" effects. We also estimate a version of the model that allows for structural state dependence in choices to control for such feedback effects, allowing for a more robust test of the causal effect of the blind taste test.</p></div>

Participation requires a consumer to incur the hassle costs associated with time spent swiping her card, responding to the beliefs survey, and sampling the tested products. So, the decision to participate may reflect benefits, many of which may be independent of unobserved preferences for the tested brands. For instance, consumers who consolidate a high proportion of their shopping in the chain may perceive a higher long-term benefit from the information treatment. Alternatively, consumers who are frequent shoppers may already be informed about the Roundy's products and thus perceive little potential for learning. At the same time, participation could also select on consumers' heterogeneous preferences. Someone with a high utility for either of the tested brands may value the immediate gratification of eating a "free sample." Alternatively, someone with a high potential information benefit (treatment effect) may also be more likely to participate.</p><p>To capture these sources of self-selection, we assume that on the date of the intervention, a consumer h will voluntarily participate as long as the incremental benefits of doing so are positive:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ŒîU h ‚â° w h Œª w + Œò h Œª Œò + Œæ h &gt; 0</formula><p>ŒîU h are the incremental benefits from participation, w h is a vector of observed measures of consumer h s shopping intensity at the Mariano's chain, Œò h are consumer h s preferences for the tested product category as in the previous section, Œõ (Œª w , Œª Œò ) are participation tastes, and Œæ h is an i.i.d. draw from a logistic distribution representing additional random net benefits from participation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Structural Estimates</head><p>We fit the demand model to the transaction data from the Greek yogurt category. We first compare the fit of six different specifications in total: (1) baseline demand (Œ≤ PL Œ≤ NB Œ≥ 0), (2) baseline demand with loyalty (Œ≤ PL Œ≤ NB 0), (3) demand with treatment effects (Œ≥ 0), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) demand with treatment effects and loyalty, (5) demand with treatment effects and selfselected participation (Œ≥ 0), and (6) demand with treatment effects, loyalty, and self-selected participation. For each specification, we compare results with versus without unobserved heterogeneity. In estimation, we use our MCMC algorithm to take 40,000 posterior draws per specification. Of these, we drop the first 10,000 draws as a burn-in period and next retain every fifth draw from the chain. This leaves us with 8,000 draws for posterior inference. We assess posterior model fit using the Newton and Raftery (1994) approximation of the posterior likelihood.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13</ref> reports the posterior likelihood of each model. As expected, unobserved heterogeneity improves model fit substantially. We also find that after controlling for heterogeneity, the inclusion of loyalty worsens posterior fit. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The inclusion of treatment effects improves fit, but the magnitude of the improvement is small because of the fact that our test panelists represent only a small fraction of the sample. Finally, we also find an additional small improvement from the correction for self-selection (i.e., relaxing the restriction Œª Œò 0). The best-fitting specification excludes loyalty but includes the treatment effect of the blind taste test and allows for selfselection. The exclusion of loyalty suggests that purchase reinforcement is not contributing to the persistent effect of the blind taste test.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">14</ref>, we report the posterior means and 95% credibility intervals for each of the selection parameters, E Œõ|D ( ), for our best-fitting specification (5). We find that the shopping statistics, average basket size in dollars, and average basket size in total items both have a significant impact on the probability of participating in the blind taste test. The low precision of our estimated effects of the taste parameters is perhaps unsurprising given the relatively small proportion of compliers in the yogurt category coupled with the fact that individual-level taste parameters are estimated with statistical error. However, our credibility intervals reveal that we cannot rule out relatively large effects.</p><p>We report the posterior mean and 95% posterior credibility intervals for each of the hyper-parameters E(Œò|D) and the diagonal elements of E Œ£|D ( )in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">15</ref>. As expected, Chobani has, overall, the highest mean brand preference, Œ± Chobani , and Roundy's has the lowest overall brand preference, Œ± Roundy s . Also as expected, the posterior probability that the mean price effect is negative is 100%.</p><p>Consistent with the DID analysis presented previously, the blind taste test has a causal effect on utility. Interestingly, we find an effect on the marginal utilities consumers assign to both Roundy's and Chobani. In the week after the test (Short Run), the expected brand taste for Roundy's increases, while the expected brand taste for Chobani decreases. The expected utility gap between the two brands shrinks by almost 80%. From 7 days to 30 days after the test (Medium Run), the expected brand utility for Chobani decreases even more, although the increase for Roundy's has diminished substantially and we cannot reject an effect of zero. At the same time, we also cannot reject that the medium-term effect on Roundy's is positive and of the same magnitude as the long-term effect. The expected utility gap between Chobani and Roundy's is nevertheless still 41% smaller than during the pretest period. Finally, between 30 and 150 days after the test (Long Run), the impact on Chobani is very small and we cannot reject that it's expected utility is unchanged from the preperiod. In contrast, we find a strong positive effect on Roundy's leading to an expected utility gap that is still 22% lower. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">15</ref> also reveals considerable heterogeneity in preferences, including in the estimated treatment effect of the blind taste test. In particular, our findings are consistent with heterogeneity in the sign of the treatment effect, with a nontrivial minority of consumers having a potential negative treatment effect on their propensity to buy the private label in the long run. In the long run, almost 70% of the mass of the treatment effect on Roundy's is positive: Pr(Œ≤ LR PL &gt; 0|D) 0.7. This finding is consistent with our valence analysis above whereby half our respondents derived a positive signal, and almost 20% derived either a negative signal or a neutral signal confirming their predicted preference for Chobani. We will allow for this heterogeneity in the treatment effects when we conduct our information counterfactual below.</p><p>In sum, our findings of a treatment effect of the blind taste test on preferences survives our controls for prices, brand choice, and the purchase incidence choice. Moreover, it does not appear to be moderated by purchase feedback through a brand loyalty mechanism. Notes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">The Impact of Information on Demand</head><p>In addition to controlling for point-of-purchase demand shifters, our key objective with the structural model is to quantify the magnitude of the information effect on the market structure for the Greek yogurt category. We use our demand estimates from the previous section to simulate the impact of this counterfactual information treatment scenario on the entire consumer population. We compare the posterior mean baseline demand with no information treatment to the short-, medium-, and long-run demand that would prevail if all consumers received the blind taste test treatment.</p><p>A critical assumption for our analysis is that the estimated treatment effects on brand preferences reported in Section 5.4 reflect information about consumers' objective tastes for the brands. Our analysis of valence in Section 4.4 is suggestive that receiving a positive signal from the intervention causes a larger treatment effect on brand choice. However, we cannot directly test this assumption. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, we plot the posterior expected demand for Roundy's Greek yogurt holding its competitors' prices fixed at their mean levels during the sample period. The demand curve is conditional on purchase so we can compare with our DID results. The plot compares the posterior mean and 95% credibility interval for expected untreated demand (control) as well as the short-, medium-, and long-run demands along a wide range of prices. As a reference, we indicate expected demand at Roundy's average in-sample posted price of $1.03. At each point along the grid of prices, there is close to a 100% posterior probability that the short-, medium-, and long-run demand exceeds the baseline demand.</p><p>Consistent with our discussion of the hyper-parameters, we cannot distinguish statistically between the mediumand long-run effect sizes. However, it is clear that the blind taste test significantly shifts out demand for the Roundy's private label brand even in the long run.</p><p>To quantify the economic magnitude of the demand effects, the three panels in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> plot the distribution of the posterior expected shift in Roundy's demand across a range of prices for the SR, MR, and LR, respectively. Once again, we hold all of the competitors' prices fixed at their average in-sample levels. At each price point, we report the expected magnitude of the shift in the demand relative to the untreated (pre) level (in share points) as well as the 95% credibility interval, indicated by the whiskers. As a reference, we once more indicate the expected demand shift at Roundy's average in-sample posted price of $1.03. We can see that the outward shifts in demand are significant, even in the long run. Although not reported in the figure, the posterior mean market share (conditional on purchase) for Roundy's at the average posted price of $1.03 increases relative to the baseline by 22.1 percentage points in the short run, 6.0 percentage points in the medium run, and 3.2 percentage points in the long run. These magnitudes are slightly larger (especially in the short run) than the treatment effects found with our DID estimator in Section 4.2. Recall that the DID estimator reported the average treatment effect on the treated population, whereas we are now using our model to measure the average treatment effect for the consumer population, having controlled for prices, brand choice, purchase incidence, and taste heterogeneity. Moreover, our analysis herein focuses on share of total Greek yogurt sales, not just the share of sales to the private label and leading national brand. In sum, if we interpret our treatment effects as information, then even though the treatment effect depreciates over time, private label would still command an additional 3 percentage points of market shares 5 months after the intervention. As a comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dub√© et al. (2018)</ref> document a long-term trend of 0.45 percentage points per year in the growth of CPG private labels in the United States.</p><p>We also plot the analogous conditional demands and distributions of demand shifts for Chobani in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6 and 7</ref>, respectively. We predict a large decline in share for Chobani in the short run and, even more, in the medium run. In the long run, we do not expect to observe a permanent change in Chobani's share of Greek yogurt sales. However, the differences between baseline and long-run Chobani demand are measured imprecisely and, using a 95% posterior credibility interval, we cannot rule out a longrun decline in share as large as 3 percentage points, If we interpret our long-run estimate as the permanent effect of the information treatment, then the private label would acquire an additional 3.2 percentage points of sales share (assuming prices do not readjust to their new equilibrium levels). Over half of these gains come from Chobani, which loses 1.8 percentage points of sales share. But a sizeable shift, nearly 1 percentage point, comes from Noosa, which was not one of the tested brands. Interestingly, the shift would benefit the retailer who obtains a higher margin on the sale of the private label ($0.31) than on Chobani ($0.27), in spite of the lower price charged for the private label. Some of these gains derive from an expected 3.1% increase in the number of buyers. Overall, the long-run effect of information increases the retailer's expected total variable category profits by 3.7%, and its expected private label profits by 38%.</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that the direct and the competitive effects of counterfactually treating all  <ref type="bibr">, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 382-406, ¬© 2020</ref> consumers to the blind taste test intervention are statistically and substantively important and, holding prices fixed, would lead to substantial substitution to the private label even over a longer horizon of half a year. These findings survive our controls for prices, brand choice, and purchase incidence. If we interpret the treatment effect as information, these findings add to our knowledge of information and the brand premium. Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bronnenberg et al. (2015)</ref> observed a role for objective information (e.g., efficacy of headache medicine), we now document a role for subjective information (e.g., the tastiness of food products).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Our findings add to the growing literature studying the implications of consumer misinformation. For the categories studied, the private label alternative has a lower market share than the leading national brands. The majority of participants in our blind taste tests selfreported a high perception of the quality of private labels, describing them as at least as good as the leading national brand. While this response could reflect acquiescence bias during the survey, it is nevertheless surprising that a much smaller proportion of these same respondents predicted they would pick the private label over the top national brand in a blind taste test.</p><p>Using three blind taste tests, we find that the majority of test participants chose the private label over the leading national brand. Using a difference-indifferences approach, we find that participation in the blind taste test has a persistent positive treatment effect on the treated consumers' demand for the private label, even 5 months after the intervention. This finding is robust to a large-dimensional factor model structure that relaxes the usual parallel trends assumption required in the DID specification. An exploratory analysis shows a strong association between the valence of the information conveyed by the taste test (i.e., positive versus negative signal) and the impact on future purchase behavior. We use a structural choice model to measure the effect of the information treatment on Greek yogurt demand, while controlling more thoroughly for the causal factors at the point of sale. We then use the estimates to measure the impact of the blind taste test on the category market structure. If we interpret the taste test estimates as an information treatment, then we predict that more informed consumers would be more likely to purchase Greek yogurt, and would be more likely to pick the private label. Moreover, total retail category profits would be higher, mostly because of consumer substitution toward the highermargin private label product.</p><p>These information effects are qualitatively different from the usual in-store advertising effects, like a display, in terms of their duration. Indeed, past research has not documented such direct long-term effects from in-store advertising. The information effects are also much larger than the typical estimates of traditional-e.g., television-advertising effects on demand (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sethuraman et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings also contribute to the literature studying the barriers to entry created by established brands. Even though the majority of our consumers pick the private label in the blind taste test, only a minority predicted they would. This inconsistency illustrates the obstacles facing the launch and growth of new brands, including private labels that may provide comparable value to consumers at a lower price. In the case of private labels, the information effect on shares after 5 months is 7 times larger than the long-term trend in recent growth in CPG private label shares in the United States.</p><p>Finally, our findings add to the established wisdom on free-sampling campaigns. The finding of a long lasting effect suggests an investment benefit from our informative, nonprice promotion, in contrast with what has been detected in past work regarding price promotions. The depreciation of the effect is also consistent with past theoretical work allowing for learning and forgetting from sampling campaigns. Our results suggest that on-going repetitions of the information treatment may be necessary to generate a more permanent benefit to private labels. In future work, it would be interesting to explore whether such on-going nonprice promotions would be cost effective as a long-term strategy. More broadly, it would be interesting to investigate whether repeated information treatments could be sufficient to overwhelm the barriers created by brand capital for the leading national brands. Treatment Group To assess robustness of our estimates, we reestimate the multinomial choice demand system for the Greek yogurt data using a shorter pretreatment time window of 150 days, to correspond to the sample used for the DID analysis in Section 4. We compare the estimates for our best-fitting specification from section 5.4 using this shorter pretreatment window in Table <ref type="table">C</ref>.1. Once again, we find that the short-and medium-run treatment effect of the blind taste test on consumers' mean brand preference for Roundy's are large and have a close to 100% posterior probability of being positive. The long-run effect is small and has only a 73% posterior probability of being positive. Unexpectedly, the short-run treatment effect on the mean brand preference for Chobani, though small, has a 99% posterior probability of being positive. The medium-run treatment effect is, as before, large and has a close to 100% posterior Bronnenberg, Dub√©, and Sanders: Consumer Misinformation and the Brand Premium probability of being negative. Also, as before, the longrun effect is very small and has only a 58% probability of being negative. In summary, most of our qualitative findings from before are robust to the shorter pretreatment time window. However, we lose precision in this shorter sample.</p></div>
