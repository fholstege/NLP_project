<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>G iven the growth of the service sector, and advances in information technology and communications that facilitate the management of relationships with customers, models of service and relationships are a fastgrowing area of marketing science. This article summarizes existing work in this area and identifies promising topics for future research. Models of service and relationships can help managers manage service more efficiently, customize service more effectively, manage customer satisfaction and relationships, and model the financial impact of those customer relationships. Models for managing service have often emphasized analytical approaches to pricing, but emerging issues such as the trade-off between privacy and customization are attracting increasing attention. The trade-offs between productivity and customization have also been addressed by both analytical and empirical models, but future research in the area of service customization will likely place increased emphasis on e-service and truly personalized interactions. Relationship models will focus less on models of customer expectations and length of relationship, and more on modeling the effects of dynamic marketing interventions with individual customers. The nature of service relationships increasingly leads to financial impact being assessed within customer and across product, rather than the traditional reverse, suggesting the increasing importance of analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) and managing the firm's customer equity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Traditionally, mainstream marketing science has involved itself principally with the goods sector and sales transactions. For example, in the inaugural issue of Marketing Science, in 1982, three of the five articles related to the goods sector and the other two were not specific to sector. The early history of marketing science was typified by understanding the sales of coffee, or the diffusion of consumer durables. Product design was studied as the determination of the optimal set of attributes. Expenditures were by product, and the optimal marketing mix determined product strategies.</p><p>By comparison the Fall 2004 issue of Marketing Science featured 10 articles, of which only one explicitly related to the goods sector. Newer research in marketing science is typified by such topics as understanding customer behavior on the Internet, or the cultivation of customer relationships. Customer strategy is studied in terms of the optimal interactions with the customer. Expenditures are increasingly by customer, and customer interaction strategies are increasingly determined in a disaggregate way, leading to the customization of service.</p><p>The reason for the shift in emphasis in marketing science topics is that the economy itself has changed significantly. For example, in 1920, the serviceproducing sector in the United States was responsible for 53% of the nonfarm employment. By 1960, that percentage had increased to 62%, and by 2000, the percentage had increased to 81% (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics). A similar pattern is found in every developed economy of the world. The trend toward service is greatest in the most advanced economies, as there is a strong positive relationship between gross domestic product and the percentage of the economy that is service <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Sheram and Soubbotina 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The degree to which service dominates the economy may actually be understated, given that service also plays a large and important role in goods-sector companies and the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Quinn et al. 1990</ref>). The reason for the importance of service in these sectors is the positive relationship between market orientation and better firm performance, as shown in the research on market orientation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jaworski and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kohli 1993, Narver and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Slater 1990)</ref> and the related concept of customer orientation (Deshpande et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rust and Chung: Marketing Models of Service and Relationships</head><p>Marketing Science 25(6), pp. <ref type="bibr">560-580, © 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">560-580, © INFORMS 561 1993</ref>. With the increasing commodization of goods, firms are increasingly turning to service as the most promising means of differentiation. Firms are adding new activities and reconfiguring existing activities to create services-led growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Sawhney et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The growth of the service sector may also be viewed as a manifestation of the changes brought by the information revolution, which has brought revolutionary changes in computing, data storage, and communications. Information technology is a key enabler to help firms collect and analyze data on consumer activities, and to make interaction with individual customers economically viable. In a more direct way, the information revolution brings about the growth of the service sector, as it results in the growth of information services in such areas as computer software, financial products, telecommunications, and entertainment. Because the advance of technology is a oneway street, given that knowledge of technology can be stored and passed along to others, the continuing expansion of the service sector and the service part of the goods sector appears to be ensured.</p><p>The increasing importance of models of service and relationships also results from several other important factors. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> First, there has been an explosion of lowcost data produced by new technologies in service sector firms. Second, research focusing on the largest part of the service sector (retailing and businessto-business service) has in many ways provided an academic foundation for much of service research. Finally, the role of service operations research in developing mostly operations research-based models in the marketing-related fields of routing, supply chains, yield management, and scheduling have provided a basis for marketing models in related areas.</p><p>We find it useful to classify the literature on service and relationships into four categories. The relationship between these four categories is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The area of managing service addresses the strategic and tactical decisions (e.g., pricing) that a firm must make to acquire and retain customers most effectively. The area of customizing service refers to the firm's efforts to personalize and individualize service products and service delivery. Customer satisfaction and relationships addresses the mechanisms that result in a successful, continuing customer relationship. The final area, financial impact of customer relationships, has to do with the efforts of the firm to quantify the profitability of its customer relationships.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents some representative articles in the evolution of models of service and relationships. We can see from the table that relatively little progress was made until the mid-1980s when an explosion of interest occurred. Early work centered on methods of measuring service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Parasuraman et al. 1988)</ref> and early models of customer retention and its financial impact (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fornell and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wernerfelt 1987, 1988)</ref>. The early 1990s saw the first serious attention to service customization and customer addressability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Blattberg and Deighton 1991)</ref>, because of the emergence of large-scale customer databases. That era also saw the development of national customer satisfaction surveys (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Fornell 1992</ref>) and the connection of managerial decisions to customer outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bolton and Drew 1991)</ref>. The increasing importance of service and relationships also led to more attention to analytical models of those topics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hauser et al. 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The mid-1990s saw the emergence of models of financial accountability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Rust et al. 1995</ref>) and the first model of customer equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Blattberg and Deighton 1996)</ref>. The mid-to late-1990s saw increasingly sophisticated analytical models of service (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Shugan and Xie 2000)</ref> and the first models of Internet marketing and e-service (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bakos and Brynjolfsson 1999)</ref>. Also around this time, researchers began using more sophisticated methods such as hazard models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bolton 1998)</ref> and fully Bayesian approaches (e.g.,  to study customer satisfaction and retention. Also at this time, models and approaches were proposed in direct marketing that would eventually evolve into customer relationship management (CRM) models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Bult and Wansbeek 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, the most important advance has been the development of models that focus marketing expenditures on individual customers (e.g., , link marketing investments to CLV and customer equity (e.g., , and ultimately connect customer equity to the market capitalization of the firm (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Gupta et al. 2004</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dhebar and Oren (1985</ref> NA <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Oliver (1980</ref><ref type="bibr">) NA 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Png (1989</ref> NA <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Parasuraman et al.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the major modeling areas in service and relationships, along with the primary methodological approaches used to investigate them. In general, we see that a variety of research approaches have been used to investigate service and relationships. Analytical approaches have been used most for investigating managing service, and especially service pricing, using the economic paradigm. The survey and experimental approaches have been most extensively used for models of customer satisfaction and relationships, for the reason that one needs to ask customers for their perceptions, because those drive satisfaction and retention. Database and panel approaches have been used primarily to map the relationships between managerial actions and customer behavior and its financial impact, as typified by CRM research today.</p><p>The remainder of this article summarizes existing work in models of service and relationships, and suggests promising future research directions. Section 2, Managing Service, explores research about the optimization of existing service marketing decisions. These decisions include such topics as controlling service pricing and demand, influencing customer's willingness to pay (e.g., service guarantees, complaint management, etc.), and incentivizing employees to maintain the service standard. Section 3, Customizing Service, summarizes research about adjusting the service product and service delivery to better suit the needs of the customer. Apart from the unique challenges faced by a service firm in customizing its service, the firm has to balance the trade-off between increasing customer satisfaction through customization and increasing firm's productivity through standardization. Together with the advent of Internet technology, comes not only new possibilities for managing this trade-off, but also a better way to serve the customer through e-service. Section 4, Customer Satisfaction and Relationships, discusses research about how customer satisfaction and delight are formed, and the impact of customer expectations on the quality of the relationship. Section 5, Financial Impact of Customer Relationships, explores research about the financial impact of service improvements, CLV, customer equity, CRM, and how customer equity affects the value of a firm. Section 6 concludes this article with a discussion of the most promising topics for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Managing Service</head><p>Managing service is different from managing goods, because of long-recognized differences between the nature of service and the nature of goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Parasuraman et al. 1985)</ref>. Some of the notable characteristics of service that make managing service different are (1) intangibility, (2) heterogeneity, (3) simultaneity of production and consumption, and (4) perishability. Intangibility implies that service cannot be  <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">) Oliver (1980</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Tse and Wilton Anderson and Sullivan (1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">), Fornell (1992</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Boulding Johnson et al. (1995</ref>,    <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Bult and Wansbeek (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Gonul and Shi (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Rust and Verhoef (2005)</ref> inventoried or easily displayed. Heterogeneity arises because service often depends on labor, which is inherently more unreliable than machines. Simultaneity of production and consumption (inseparability) means that the consumer participates in the transaction, and therefore service is not easily centralized. Perishability means that for many services, once the time of potential service passes, the opportunity to sell that service perishes. Recently, the four characteristics of service have been challenged, as researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Lovelock and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gummesson 2004, Vargo and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Lusch 2004)</ref> have criticized the usefulness of the intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability framework in separating goods and service, mainly because the line separating goods and service is increasingly becoming blurred. Nevertheless, the characteristics of intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability are the primary characteristics of service that result in the unique challenges and opportunities for marketing science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Service Demand</head><p>The key characteristic of service demand is that timing matters. Service demand is perishable, and thus it is important to manage that timing. If demand exceeds capacity at any time, then an opportunity is lost. In the most basic form, the management of service demand is a yield management problem, a problem for which <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Kimes (1989)</ref> provides an excellent review. Yield management is a process of allocating the right inventory to the right customer at the right time, at the right price, with the objective of maximizing revenue. To achieve these objectives, a firm has to forecast demand and optimize its marketing mix based on the forecast. Sometimes the complexity of the operating environment may make the forecasting and optimization extremely difficult. It is interesting to note that when the environment is complex, some research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Van Ryzin and</ref><ref type="bibr">McGill 2000, Ha 2001)</ref> advocates the use of simple guidelines and heuristics as a viable service and demand management alternative.</p><p>The movie industry demonstrates the critical importance of managing the timing in which a service is made available to the consumers. Service demand in the movie industry is highly perishable, and the control over the movie release date critically affects the success of a new movie. It is always easier for a firm to maximize its revenues if the firm can forecast demand accurately. When demand follows a set pattern through time, the firm can make use of past sales data to improve its estimates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Sawhney and Eliashberg (1996)</ref> show that the motion picture box office revenues follow a highly regular pattern. This pattern is influenced by the intensity of information flowing to the consumers and the intensity of product distribution. Learning from the past life cycles and seasonal patterns of a movie launch can greatly improve the launch timing, and thus a movie's success. Incorporating seasonal patterns into a service model will also improve the accuracy of demand predictions. We can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Radas and Shugan (1998b)</ref> for a method of incorporating seasonal patterns to any dynamic model without changing the model's fundamental assumptions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Neelamegham and Chintagunta (1999)</ref> deal with a more complex problem of scheduling movie launches across multiple markets with different availability of data and determinants of viewerships. They are able to accurately forecast the success of movie launches using a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model. The competitive dynamics of the movie industry is another important consideration for the timing of movie launches <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Foutz and Kadiyali 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Krider and Weinberg (1998)</ref> show that, depending on the product life cycle, it is better for a weaker movie to delay its opening to prevent head-to-head competition with stronger movies.</p><p>In addition to timing the availability of the service, a firm can manage demand through shaping the expectations of consumers on the utilities that they will derive from the service. Customer expectations play a major role in shaping consumption behaviors for the movies, theaters, and recreational industries. Critical reviews, along with other psychological variables such as product perception and interest, influence box office receipts, and whether consumers will consume the service in the first place (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Neelamegham and Jain 1999)</ref>. By controlling the review process, the firm controls the amount of product information provided to the consumers, and thus controls the formation of consumer expectations. As such, managing demand in the movies, theaters, and recreational industries depends, in part, on how well a firm can influence the review process <ref type="bibr">Shugan 1997, Basuroy et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Another way that customer expectations affects demand is through influencing what customers perceive to be a fair exchange. Payment equity is the fairness perceived by the customers when they exchange payment in return for the service that a firm provides. It is evaluated using the difference between a customer's expectations and the actual firm's performance; this equity will determine the customer's usage of the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Bolton and Lemon 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Service Pricing</head><p>Managing demand also involves strategies for pricing over time. The optimal pricing schemes differ with the kinds of services that a firm provides and the consumer segments a firm serves. Different consumers have different reservation prices for different types of services. In addition, these reservation prices can change from one period to the next. A firm improves its profitability when it can observe the reservation prices of the different consumers. This can be done to some extent by observing consumer purchasing behaviors.</p><p>One way for a firm to know what kind of pricing strategy it should adopt is by looking at the type of service the firm provides. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Desiraju and Shugan (1999)</ref> provide a categorization of service types based on the differences between customers' reservation prices during the different periods of arrival. Using this categorization, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Desiraju and Shugan (1999)</ref> prescribe different pricing strategies for the different types of services. As an illustration, services involving airlines, hotels, and car rentals experience early arrivals from customers with relatively lower reservation prices. These services are grouped into the same category. One of the pricing strategies prescribed for the firm is to limit the sales in the earlier time period. This reserves capacity for customers with relatively higher reservation prices in later periods. We can optimally set advance and spot purchase prices using these differences <ref type="bibr">Xie 2000, 2004)</ref>. Another pricing strategy that can be used in the airlines, hotels, and car rental industry is contingent pricing. Contingent pricing price discriminates a customer based on the probability that this customer will obtain the product. One customer may pay a high price in exchange for the certainty of receiving the product. Another customer may pay a low price but face the possibility of not receiving the product. This pricing scheme allocates the product to those who value the product most, and compensates the customer who risks not receiving the product with a lower price <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Biyalogorsky and Gerstner 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Technological advancements have made it viable to implement complex pricing schemes, as new technologies have greatly reduced the costs and also the possible abuse of such schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Xie and Shugan 2001)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Xie and Shugan (2001)</ref> show that the profits from advance selling do not come from extracting more surpluses from consumers, but from making it possible for more consumers to purchase the product. The more a firm knows about the customers' reservation prices, the more a firm can improve its pricing strategy. For example, when customer demand is uncertain and customers are risk aversed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Png (1989)</ref> shows that it is optimal for a firm to offer reservations to customers at no cost, as a means of inferring how much customers value the service.</p><p>The firm may face varying demand over different time periods. During peak periods, the full capacity of the firm is utilized to help satisfy the demand. In off-peak periods, demand is lower, and there is unutilized firm's capacity. One of the usual capacity management techniques involves lowering the price charged during the off-peak period (i.e., off-peak price) to smooth out the fluctuations in sales demand. The notion is that smoothing out demand will help increase yield. Although this is a conventional practice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Radas and Shugan (1998a)</ref> show that in some situations, a firm is better off increasing the customers' willingness to pay during the peak period. Their model achieves this through bundling peak service with off-peak service, without decreasing the off-peak price. Other support for the use of service bundling is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Guiltinan (1987)</ref>, which provides a framework for selecting the different services to form mixed bundles. That article demonstrates that by concurrently selling product bundles and their individual components (i.e., mixed bundling), a firm is able to cross-sell to existing customers and also to obtain new customers who were not purchasing the firm's products in the past.</p><p>If we are to evaluate the short-term profitability impact of bundling alone, the increase in total margins from the use of bundling depends on the ability and quantity of the service that customers are able to consume, based on their cost of time, price sensitivity, and reservation prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Venkatesh and Mahajan 1993)</ref>. In addition, the profitability of the bundling strategy also depends on the costs incurred for bundling and administering the sales of the bundle. Thus, in the case of digital goods, when the marginal costs of production and product aggregation are low, it makes sense to use bundling to increase the appeal and competitiveness of the product <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bakos and Brynjolfsson 1999)</ref>. When a seller of information goods incurs cost of administering a usage-based pricing scheme, <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Sundarajan (2004)</ref> shows that offering a fixed-fee pricing in addition to a nonlinear usage-based pricing is always profit improving. In addition, the bundle of information goods can be made more appealing to the customers if the seller offers the right combination of fixed-fee-and usage-based contracts.</p><p>Whether to use a mixed bundling strategy or a pure bundling strategy (i.e., selling the bundle only and not the individual components) depends, in part, on the costs of administering mixed bundling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ansari et al. (1996)</ref> demonstrate this in a user-maximizing nonprofit organization. In their model, the nonprofit organization faces a nondeficit constraint, and thus is particularly mindful of the fixed costs involved in delivering its products. The administrative cost of offering mixed bundling is higher than pure bundling without substantially increasing product usage. Therefore, a pure bundling strategy is preferred. Maximizing the number of users is especially relevant in the case of a nonprofit service organization. For a nonprofit organization, the main goal may be to maximize the total utilities of the individuals that the organization serves, instead of maximizing the organization's profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Metters and Vargas 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dhebar and Oren (1985)</ref> characterize an optimal pricing strategy as one that takes into account maximizing the present value of a firm's profits, as well as the dynamics of consumer demand. The pricing of a service affects the adoption rate by consumers. Thus, a service firm may choose to charge a lower price in the introductory stage of the service to generate positive word of mouth among the consumers, and to speed up the learning of the service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Mesak and Darrat 2002)</ref>. After trying a product from one firm, whether a customer will try another product from the competitor depends on the first product quality, and the likelihood of getting a worse product from the competitor. The likelihood of getting a second product that is worse depends on the distribution of product quality in the industry. Thus, this quality distribution will affect how sustainable is the initial market share captured using a lower introductory price <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Villas-Boas 2004)</ref>. In the case of an existing product, firms have to be discerning with the segments of the customer to whom they offer a lower price. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson and Simester (2004)</ref> show that while deeper price discounts increase future purchases for the new customers, they reduce purchases from established customers. Deeper price discounts can encourage established customers to forward buy and be more sensitive to deals. The pricing for a service can be done differently for the different components of the service. The idea behind this is that service access pricing and usage pricing have different effects on initial demand and customer retention. Incorporating the effect of customer attrition in a service model results in a better estimation of customer price sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Danaher 2002)</ref>. For the case of membership services, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Fruchter and Rao (2001)</ref> demonstrate the superiority of a twopart pricing scheme when a firm obtains its revenue separately from service access and usage. In Fruchter and Rao's ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>) model, keeping the membership fee low helps to boost the adoption rate of the service through word of mouth. As the early adopters tend to be heavy users, pricing the usage component high at the service's introductory stage extracts maximum surplus from consumers. Eventually, the price of the usage component is lowered to encourage usage of the service by other consumers. The use of a two-part pricing scheme frees the firm from the need to price every component of the service low during the introductory stage.</p><p>Apart from differentiating the price charged for the different product options, firms may price differentiate based on how quickly services are delivered to the customers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Van Mieghem (2000)</ref> provides a model in which customers measure a firm's service quality by the delay they experienced in receiving the service. Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Mieghem (2000)</ref> has also provided a scheduling rule for dealing with such a scenario.</p><p>The applications of pricing strategies discussed in this article so far are based mostly on traditional ("offline") service contexts. Nevertheless, pricing strategies are relevant in the online environment as well. Although the Internet has made price comparison easier, it has not ended the online price differences among the different firms. Some researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pan et al. 2002, Ancarani and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Shankar 2004)</ref> show that price differences among online firms still persist, and that online firms may adopt different pricing for different consumer segments. Internet shopping agents allow consumers to effortlessly compare the prices offered by the various online retailers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Iyer and Pazgal (2004)</ref> show that consumers who use the Internet shopping agents enjoy lower prices as compared to consumers who do not. The number of retailers that join an Internet shopping agent affect the agent's consumer reach. This change in reach and the number of retailers within an Internet shopping agent determine the benefit of a price cut. Thus the average prices paid within an Internet shopping agent can increase or decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Iyer and Pazgal 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Service Guarantees</head><p>The greater heterogeneity of quality inherent in service leads to additional risk for the customer. This leads many businesses to create service guarantees that reduce consumer risk. How to construct these guarantees most effectively has formed a fruitful area of research in marketing science. Service guarantees are also relevant in the goods context. Each time a consumer purchases a good, the service components that come with the good are purchased. These components include the delivery service provided by the seller and the after-sales service provided by the manufacturer. Not only do service guarantees affect customer satisfaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Slotegraaf and Inman (2004)</ref> show that the different aspect of a service guarantee affects customer satisfaction differently during the difference phases of a product's life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Kumar et al. (1997)</ref> show that providing an assurance on the amount of wait time generally improves customer satisfaction when customers are waiting for the service to be delivered. However, after the customers have received the service, their satisfaction level is affected by whether the service is delivered within the time guaranteed. Service guarantees benefit the firm, as they encourage every consumer to try the product and not to reduce the actual product price paid to compensate for the risk of product nonperformance <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Fruchter and Gerstner 1999)</ref>. Given the opportunity, a consumer may adjust the risk level to one that is more tolerable. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Padmanabhan and Rao (1993)</ref> show that risk-averse consumers will tend to purchase extended product service contracts if the contracts are available to augment the manufacturer warranty. Service guarantees serve as a credible signal of product quality, as low-quality products are more expensive to warrant <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Lutz 1989)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Moorthy and Srinivasan (1995)</ref> argue that a full money-back guarantee is a more effective way to signal product quality than charging a premium price or presenting uninformative advertisements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Complaint Management</head><p>Another effect of the heterogeneity of service is the inevitable incidence of consumer complaints when the service is not perceived as adequate. This was one of the earliest service areas to be addressed by marketing modelers, and had considerable impact on subsequent marketing science research, because it introduced the elements of interactive customer experience, continuing customer relationships, and their long-term financial impact.</p><p>Not all dissatisfied customers complain, but dissatisfied customers have higher probabilities of reducing their product usages and purchases. Satisfied customers, on the other hand, have a higher probability of generating positive word of mouth, which helps to attract potential customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Blodgett and Anderson 2000)</ref>. Complaint management benefits a firm, as it positively influences customers' expected utilities of a purchase, customers' perceived purchase risk, customers' perception of product quality, and the generation of favorable word of mouth. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Chu et al. (1998)</ref> show that a more restrictive refund policy will increase consumers' perceived risk of dissatisfaction, and as a result, reduce the number of products consumers purchase. Despite the possibility of customer abuse, they show that a no-questionsasked return policy can be optimal. In the case of a frequently purchased service, the value of future sales generated by a retained customer is likely to be much higher than the compensation needed to appease a complaint. As a defensive strategy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Fornell and Wernerfelt (1987)</ref> show that customer complaints should be encouraged, because complaints provide the firm opportunities to appease and retain dissatisfied customers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fornell and Wernerfelt (1988)</ref> show that this strategy is more effective when the firm faces more competitors, and when the customers are more sensitive to quality. In addition, as complaint volume is higher in a concentrated industry where customers have fewer alternative service providers, the potential payoff from introducing complaint management is higher. Firms should be mindful, however, that factors other than the compensation policy also affect customer satisfaction with service failure recoveries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Smith et al. (1999)</ref> show that the process that a customer goes through during the service recovery can also affect the level of customer satisfaction.</p><p>Complaint management, in the form of a firm's refund policy to its channel intermediaries, will likewise reduce the intermediaries' perceived purchase risks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Padmanabhan and Png (1997)</ref> show that by reducing purchase risks, the downstream intermediaries are encouraged to carry an increased supply of the firm's products. The increased supply of the product intensifies competition among these downstream intermediaries, as they compete among themselves for market share. This competition lowers final price to the consumer and helps boost manufacturer sales volume. This is a more effective and profitable way to increase sales quantity for the manufacturer than through lowering the price to the intermediaries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Padmanabhan and Png's (1997)</ref> results are driven largely by the intermediaries' uncertainty of their customers' demand. When the intermediaries are certain of the demand, there is no purchase risk. The intermediaries can then strategically reduce their stock holdings to increase their sale prices <ref type="bibr">(Wang 2004, Padmanabhan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Png 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Employee Incentives</head><p>While research has long shown that it pays the organization to satisfy customers, a corollary issue is how to incentivize employees to provide the appropriate behavior. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hauser et al. (1994)</ref> provides one approach to addressing this problem, and begins to tie the marketing issues to the human resources (HR) issues required for successful service provision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hauser et al. (1994)</ref> provide a means of incentivizing employees to increase the customer satisfaction level, and thus ultimately increase the profitability of the service provider. By incentivizing employees on both sales and customer satisfaction, the employees are encouraged to make a short-versus longterm trade-off that is best for the firm. Employees put in more effort in improving customer's satisfaction when a larger portion of their bonus depends on it. Customer satisfaction levels will be a better measure than employee effort levels to use for improving firms' profits when employee efforts are hard to evaluate. The model shows, however, that the reliance on customer satisfaction in an incentive scheme should depend on how precisely customer satisfaction is measured, in addition to how short-term focused the employees are. There is a limit to how much customer satisfaction can be gained from incentivizing employees. Employees work within the service design offered by the firm. The next logical step in increasing customer satisfaction will thus involve customizing the service to better suit the needs of customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Customizing Service</head><p>Unlike physical goods, service is often based primarily on personal interaction or information processing, both of which lend themselves well to customization. This is because a human service provider can adjust to the needs of the customer as part of the interaction, and a service based primarily on information may customize by merely changing bits of information. Thus, although service design uses many of the same approaches as product design, service delivery and interactive customization are best seen as entirely different from product design. Research indicates that customization and the satisfaction that results from it often form a trade-off with productivity in the arena of service, whereas satisfaction and productivity tend to be in harmony in the manufacturing context. An important and growing application area with respect to service customization is e-service, the provision of service over the Internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Service Design and Customization</head><p>Traditional thinking in marketing science holds that the service design problem is no different from the product design problem for physical goods. We can see this viewpoint in the work of Green and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Wind et al. 1989)</ref>, who applied standard conjoint methodologies to the problem of designing a service. A similar conceptualization is involved with the application of discrete choice analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Verma et al. 1999</ref>) and quality function deployment <ref type="bibr">(Griffin Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 560-580, © 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">INFORMS and Hauser 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Hauser and Clausing 1988</ref> to service design. This traditional thinking fails in the context of service, as a key component of satisfying the customer in a service context is not only designing the service but also in delivering the service well. The delivery component becomes especially important in service because of the higher degree of variability usually encountered in service, which tends to be more labor intensive.</p><p>Unlike physical goods, where product quality is primarily driven by adherence to manufacturing specifications, service demands a multidimensional view of the nature of quality. One conceptualization, that views all offerings as service <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Rust et al. 1996)</ref>, posits that service can be broken down into the physical product, service product, service delivery, and service environment. The elements of physical product, service product (e.g., a warranty or service contract), and service environment (e.g., a showroom or a theme park) are amenable to standard product design methods. The element of service delivery, however, is not amenable to those methods, because service delivery relates to "working your plan" rather than "planning your work." Service delivery and service design efficiency are seen as distinct <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Frei and Harker 1999)</ref>, and no matter how good the service design might be, the actual delivery of that service design may be lacking. In product design models, the emphasis is on the attributes of the product and adherence to specifications, whereas in service delivery and service customization, the emphasis is on the perceptions of the customer and real-time customization to meet the needs of the customer. In other words, providing high-quality manufactured goods means standardizing as much as possible, but providing high-quality service means customizing as much as possible to what the individual customer desires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Satisfaction/Productivity Trade-Off</head><p>From the preceding section, we see that providing high-quality manufactured goods means standardizing as much as possible-making every part exactly the same, whereas providing high-quality service means customizing as much as possible-making every service contact different. Standardizing generally leads to higher efficiency, higher productivity, and lower costs. Customization on the other hand, may result in lower efficiency, lower productivity, and higher costs. The nature of service delivery inevitably leads to a trade-off between satisfaction and productivity for services that are not present for goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderson et al. 1997</ref>). This same trade-off can lead to tension between the marketing function and the operations/engineering function, with the marketing function seeking to satisfy customers and increase revenues, and the operations/engineering function seeking to increase efficiency and productivity and decrease costs. Research has shown that the performance feedback loops in the management of a company can systematically lead to the erosion of service quality over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Oliva and Sterman 2001)</ref>. Recent research suggests that ignoring the satisfaction/productivity trade-off and trying to both increase revenues and decrease costs simultaneously can lead to suboptimal financial results .</p><p>There is theoretical evidence that the shift from standardization to customization is likely to become more pronounced over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Varki and Rust (1998)</ref> provide a mathematical framework for how the advance of technology impacts optimal segment size (or equivalently, how the advance of technology impacts the degree of customization). The trend of technological changes in the area of flexible manufacturing and programmable automation for example, has been moving toward the reduction of variable production cost. This increased production efficiency has made smaller segments feasible. In addition, improvement in product technology can stimulate consumer demand and increase the depth of consumer consumption. As the optimal segment size is reduced, firms can sell more to existing customers. The economy of scale effects on marginal cost, however, tends to favor an increase in segment size. The optimal segment size as a result of technological changes therefore depends on how the changes affect both demand and costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">E-Service</head><p>The advent of the Internet has opened up new possibilities for personal interaction with the customer and customization of the service to better suit customer needs. First, the Internet is comprised of networked computers, which makes possible the processing of customer information. Second, the Internet is a web of two-way connections, making possible interactivity. Third, the information medium that the Internet operates in means that customer information can be readily sought, the information can be immediately processed, and the customized service product delivered in real time back to the customer.</p><p>The Internet empowers consumers as it reduces the cost of searching for information. This benefit to the consumer is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bakos' (1997)</ref> model. In that model, a consumer's utility is determined by the reservation price, price paid, cost of fit, and expected cost of search. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bakos (1997)</ref> shows that the lowering of search costs helps to reduce buyers' cost of fit, and thus a consumer ends up with a bettersuited product in a market with differentiated product offerings. The benefit of online searches, however, suffers from a diminishing marginal return effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Ratchford et al. (2003)</ref> show that those consumers with less initial information will gain more from an online search than those who started off with more information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Wu et al. (2004)</ref> show that a firm benefits by providing free product information online. This is true even if some customers free ride on the information provided and purchase the product elsewhere. A firm that provides free product information improves its reputation, and increases the probability that a nonshopper will visit its website for service and purchases. The importance of a firm's reputation is greater in an online environment as many of the firm's service dimensions are not visible to the customer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Danaher et al. (2003)</ref> show that brand share (a proxy for reputation) has a higher correlation to customer loyalty in an online environment as compared to an offline environment. The ability to manage online relationships requires the ability to model online behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bucklin and Sismeiro 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">, Sismeiro and Bucklin 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">, Telang et al. 2004</ref>, taking into account such issues as the difference in consumers' degree of brand considerations as a result of their online search behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wu and Rangaswamy 2003)</ref>. As in all relationship-management efforts, a firm requires a means of measuring service quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Parasuraman et al. (2005)</ref> demonstrate the properties of a multiple-item scale for assessing e-service quality, and demonstrate the need for a different scale for routine and nonroutine online customers.</p><p>The promise of lower search costs and better product fit does not mean that all consumers will embrace the use of the Internet. Research shows that optimism, innovativeness, insecurity, and discomfort are factors that will determine the readiness that individuals have for new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Parasuraman 2000)</ref>. Among consumers who utilize online services, there are differences in their abilities to reap the benefits of the service provided online. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Jain and Kannan (2002)</ref> show that these differences in abilities determine a consumer's online service preference and how a firm should price its service optimally.</p><p>Information overload may result as a consequence of the massive amount of information available online and the ease of accessing this information. Consumers deal with this problem by being more selective to the types of information to which they respond. In return, firms work harder to entice consumers to respond to their messages. Messages that are more customized and better designed help firms to get through to consumers. In addition, information that is better presented helps reduce the likelihood of information overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Lurie 2004)</ref>, which, in turn, helps a firm to get the key selling points across to consumers. Interestingly, the technology that brings about information overload also brings with it the capacity for better information customization. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ansari and Mela's (2003)</ref> optimization model uses clickstream data from web users to customize the design and content of an e-mail to increase website traffic. Apart from improving the content of the messages, firms may also manage the length and duration of consumers' exposure to them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Chatterjee et al. (2003)</ref> show that consumers' responses to firms' messages may also depend on the frequency, duration, and time lapse between message exposures.</p><p>At the same time that the Internet empowers consumers with the ability to make better choices, the Internet also empowers firms to manage their customers better, and to better serve those customers' needs. In the area of improving customer management, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Padmanabhan and Tuzhilin (2003)</ref> discuss the various electronic customer relationship management applications and the opportunities for optimizing them. On the Internet's role in improving a firm's ability to better serve its customers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Rust and Lemon (2001)</ref> cite three central changes in which the Internet can help firms improve their services. They include true interactivity with consumers, customer-specific and situational personalization, and opportunities for real-time adjustments of the firm's offering to customers. For general discussions on the framework and future research opportunities for online personalization, we can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Murthi and Sarkar (2003)</ref>.</p><p>To better serve the needs of their customers, firms need to obtain information on their customers' preferences. There are many ways in which customer preferences can be obtained online. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Raghu et al.

These preferences can then be used to segment customers into clusters, and finally to tailor the product makeup to best suit the average preferences of the clusters. The processes of acquiring customers' preferences and subsequently tailoring the product makeup to suit the customers are carried out dynamically online. The ultimate aim of such processes is to achieve real-time marketing, as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Oliver et al.

In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Xue and Harker (2002)</ref> show that through the Internet, a firm is better able to involve the consumers as coproducers of the service. This increases the role that consumers play in the service-production and delivery processes. One benefit of engaging the customer in the coproduction process is that it allows the firm to be more efficient in the way it manages its customers.

Another caveat is that high tech does not mean neglecting the most important interactions between service employees and the customers. These "critical incidents" are customer experiences that have an important impact on customer satisfaction. Through a series of critical incident studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Meuter et al. (2000)</ref> demonstrated that even in self-service technologies, where customers are supposed to help fulfill their own needs, employees' initiatives to improve service and customers' satisfaction in such areas as technical support and troubleshooting still play a critical role in the firm's strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Customer Satisfaction and Relationships</head><p>Although the quality of physical products may sometimes be adequately measured by attributes, objective performance indicators, or adherence to manufacturing specifications, the quality of service is adequately measured only by customer perceptions. This implies that customer satisfaction should receive considerable attention in service research. Also, while the marketing of physical goods (e.g., cars or breakfast cereal) may sometimes be adequately examined using individual transactions, the marketing of service (e.g., banking or airlines) generally requires the examination of relationships over time. Because customer satisfaction is one of the primary factors leading to the continuation of relationships, the connection between the two also forms an important area of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Customer Satisfaction and Delight</head><p>The measurement and modeling of customer satisfaction (and its most extreme manifestation, customer delight) leads to many interesting and useful research issues.

The early service quality models <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Parasuraman et al. 1988</ref>) used a similar conceptual formulation.</p><p>The nature of consumer response to customersatisfaction surveys leads to the necessity of modeling many phenomena of practical importance, including response skewness <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Peterson and Wilson 1992)</ref> and direct versus inferred measurement of the attribute importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Griffin and Hauser 1993)</ref>. Including customer satisfaction in a broader nomological net that includes behavior led naturally to the construction of simultaneous equation models of the impact of satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bolton and</ref><ref type="bibr">Drew 1991, Danaher and</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have also investigated the most extreme form of customer satisfaction-customer delight.

Some researchers have posited a nonlinear effect for satisfaction, involving a "zone of tolerance" <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Parasuraman et al. 1994</ref>) in which there is a first threshold of satisfaction, below which there is little behavioral impact, and a second threshold of satisfaction, at which customer delight kicks in.

Expectations have generally been studied at the individual consumer level, but work also exists that studies the aggregate average of expectations and how that relates to other aggregate measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Johnson et al. 1995)</ref>. At the individual level, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Tse and Wilton (1988)</ref> provided a deeper understanding of the nature of customer expectations, including the idea that there are multiple kinds of expectations. This idea was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Boulding et al. (1993)</ref> who incorporated the multiple expectations idea in a linear updating framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson and Sullivan (1993)</ref> provided an alternative updating model, and also suggested (but did not implement) the idea of a fully Bayesian updating model for expectations. A fully Bayesian expectations updating model was supplied by  who showed that a standard Bayesian updating model, combined with a concave utility curve, can successfully predict some unintuitive behavioral effects, and demonstrated those effects with behavioral experiments. Some of that study's unintuitive behavioral effects include the finding that customers may rationally choose an option with lower expected quality, and that paying more attention to loyal customers can sometimes be counterproductive. The research also showed that consideration of the distribution of expectations, in addition to the point expectation, is necessary to explain some behavioral effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bordley (2001)</ref> provided an alternative Bayesian approach to expectations, providing a utility model based on probability of exceeding an expectations threshold.</p></div>

How customers respond to a loyalty program depends on the probability and the magnitude of the rewards provided. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Kivetz (2004)</ref> shows that how customers evaluate the trade-off between the chance of winning a reward in a loyalty program and the value of the reward is systematically affected by the efforts required from them.</p><p>Marketing science researchers have typically used hazard models to model the length of customer relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Schmittlein et al.

This approach allows the computation of the probability that any particular customer's relationship is still active. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bolton (1998)</ref> analyzes instead the duration of the customer's relationship with a continuous service provider. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bolton's (1998)</ref> results indicate that customer satisfaction ratings obtained prior to any decision to cancel or stay loyal to the provider are positively related to the duration of the relationship. Another important issue related to customer relationship is how frequently customers purchase a product from a firm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Helsen and Schmittlein (1993)</ref> provide such a model, where the interpurchase time is estimated using the product's regular price, promotional price cut, and past average interpurchase time.

One of the few empirical demonstrations of this effect shows that customer satisfaction has a positive impact on word of mouth, which, in turn, has a positive impact on sales and market share <ref type="bibr">(Danaher Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 560-580, © 2006 INFORMS and</ref>. Another empirical investigation of word of mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson 1998</ref>) confirms popular expectations that dissatisfaction produces more negative word of mouth than satisfaction produces positive word of mouth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hogan et al. (2003)</ref> explore the mechanisms by which word of mouth impacts customer profitability. They show that word of mouth is more important during the early part of the product life cycle, as the early adopters' word of mouth affects the growth rate of product adoption. One of the challenges in measuring word of mouth is that it is difficult to observe what is usually in the form of private conversations. Through monitoring online conversations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Godes and Mayzlin (2004)</ref> demonstrate how word of mouth can be measured. In addition, they show a relationship between the dispersion of online conversations across online communities and the popularity of television shows.</p><p>To encourage customer referrals, two possible strategies a firm can use is providing the customer with referral rewards, and providing the customer with exceptional value through price reduction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Biyalogorsky et al. (2001)</ref> show that the optimal mix of price and referral reward depends on how demanding consumers are on the price reduction before they are willing to recommend the firm's product to others. The optimal mix also depends on how effective the referral rewards are in bringing in new customers. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Biyalogorsky et al. (2001)</ref> model explains why referral rewards are not always used in practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Verhoef et al. (2002)</ref> investigate the variables that impact the tendency to engage in word of mouth. They find that the length of the relationship between a customer and a firm plays a moderating role on how trust, satisfaction, commitment, and payment equity affect customer referrals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Financial Impact of Customer Relationships</head><p>With relationships increasingly the focus of business, rather than transactions, financial impact becomes less an issue of aggregate response based on aggregate expenditures, and more a matter of individual-level satisfaction, retention, and profitability. In addition, profitability of the relationship is projected in terms of future cash flows. This perspective has led to a proliferation of models of chains of financial impact, with the goal of modeling how service improvements affect profitability. These models have evolved into models that estimate CLV for each customer, aggregate those lifetime values into customer equity, and manage the financial impact of managerial interventions based on CLV and customer equity. Companies are increasingly able to manage those interventions at the individual customer level, resulting in a management approach currently referred to as CRM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Chains of Financial Impact</head><p>Models for projecting the financial impact of service improvements, based on customer retention, emerged in the early 1990s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Rust and Zahorik 1993)</ref>. This approach, combined with the tree approach to customer satisfaction analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kordupleski et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Gale 1994</ref>) culminated in the "return on quality" model <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Rust et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Rust et al. , 1996</ref>, a model that can project the return on investment from targeted service quality improvements. An alternative model was the "service profit chain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Heskett et al. 1994)</ref>, which extended the return on quality model by also linking employee satisfaction, the idea being that happy employees lead to happy customers. Unfortunately, there is weak empirical support for this extension (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Loveman 1998)</ref>, and the subsequent HR literature has shown that the linkage between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction is far from straightforward (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Schneider et al. 1998)</ref>. Nevertheless, some researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Kamakura et al. 2002)</ref> have continued to build on this framework. While the link from employee satisfaction to customer satisfaction is precarious, the links from customer satisfaction to positive behavioral outcomes (and ultimately financial outcomes) have been demonstrated consistently (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Zeithaml et al. 1996</ref>. Aggregate chains of effect linking customer satisfaction to financial impact have also been shown <ref type="bibr">(Anderson et al. 1994, Johnson and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Gustafsson 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In the same way that customizing products improves customer satisfaction and profitability, Bowman and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Narayandas (2004)</ref> show that tailoring customer management effort to the different customer is necessary to optimize profits. For example, larger customers are more demanding and the same customer management effort is more effective for customers with greater loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">CLV and Customer Equity</head><p>CLV models were first proposed in the direct marketing arena <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Dwyer 1989)</ref>, where the necessary data on individual-level marketing interventions and profitability were readily available. These concepts were soon applied also in financial services <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Storbacka 1994</ref>). An excellent overview of available CLV models is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Berger and Nasr (1998)</ref> based on the ability to accurately estimate customer profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Mulhern 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The CLV concept was extended to the concept of customer equity (the sum of the firm's customers' CLVs), enabling CLV to be used to guide corporate strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Blattberg and Deighton 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Blattberg et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Fruchter and Zhang 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">, Thomas 2001</ref>). These models (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Pfeifer and Carraway 2000)</ref> were based on firms that had a customer database, but no knowledge of competition. Econometric models for projecting the CLV, based on customer databases, have been developed (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kumar 2000, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>By combining the customer equity idea with the chain of effect models for return on quality, and collecting data necessary to analyze the impact of competition, it is possible to create a model that can project the impact on customer equity of any marketing expenditure . Subsequent authors have explored a variety of aspects related to the implementation of customer equity management in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bell et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Berger et al. 2002</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Financial Impact</head><p>Customer equity is a reasonable proxy for the value of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gupta et al. 2004</ref>, implying that strategies that improve customer equity also increase the value of the firm. Linking customer assets such as customer satisfaction to the value of the firm and other measures of marketing productivity makes marketing accountable . Chain-ofeffect models that culminate in customer equity thus provide managers with "what if" capabilities that form a general model for evaluating marketing return on investment . A comprehensive overview of how customer equity and other marketing assets relate to financial impact and other measures of marketing productivity is given in .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</head><p>It is perhaps surprising, given the pervasiveness of CRM today, that the term "CRM," meaning "customer relationship management," did not appear in a Proquest search of the leading marketing journals until 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Srivastava et al. 1999)</ref>. CRM refers to managing customers one at a time-usually through automated or database-driven marketing interventions. The importance of customer relationships and CLV have naturally led to this approach.</p><p>Scientific methods for direct marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Blattberg and Deighton 1991)</ref> were devised as a result of data availability, interactivity, and the ability to direct marketing interventions to specific individuals. Methods for optimizing direct marketing followed (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wansbeek 1995, Haughton and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Oulabi 1997)</ref>. Many recent advances in direct marketing relate to the ability to analyze and explore large databases, using techniques such as data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Drew et al. 2001)</ref>, stochastic frontier models (Byung-Doa and Sun-Oka 1999), multiple adaptive regression splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Deichmann et al. 2002)</ref>, and dynamic multilevel modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Elsner et al. 2004</ref>). Another direction is the segmentation of marketing interventions using a priori segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bitran and Mondschein 1996)</ref>, latent class segmentation <ref type="bibr">Wittink 1996, DeSarbo and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ramaswamy 1994)</ref>, and finally full personalization of marketing interventions using hierarchical models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods <ref type="bibr">(Rossi et al. 1996, Rust and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Verhoef 2005)</ref>.</p><p>CRM, however, differs from traditional direct marketing because it usually involves customer contact over a variety of contact media (e.g., direct mail, Internet contacts, personal selling contacts, telephone contacts, etc.). Along with CRM's multicontact media approach is the need to design a mix of marketing interventions for each customer individually <ref type="bibr">(DeWulf et al. 2001, Rust and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Verhoef 2005)</ref>. Given that customers have different characteristics, different types of interventions impact individual customers differently (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">DeWulf et al. 2001</ref>). In addition, different CRM interventions could serve different purposes. Some interventions (e.g., direct mailings) help to trigger some favorable actions like cross-purchasing among the customers, while other interventions (e.g., relationship mailings) are more oriented toward customer relationship building <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Berry 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Bhattacharya and Bolton 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">, McDonald 1998</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Directions for Future Research</head><p>The continuation and possible acceleration of the same trends that produced the shift toward service and relationships make it possible for us to predict the most important areas for future research. We look, therefore, to the influence of computing, data storage, and communications in predicting which areas of research will become more important in the future. In particular, we extrapolate from today's business environment to a day in which computing is more powerful, data storage is more extensive, and communications are more pervasive. What's more, we look to ways in which these trends interact. The remainder of this section highlights the future research areas that we believe will be particularly promising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Privacy Versus Customization</head><p>As the data collection, storage, and analysis about individual customers proliferates, concerns mount about the potentially improper use of this information, leading many consumers to seek better protection for their privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Peterson 2001</ref>). Yet, that same data collection, storage, and analysis permits companies to customize their offerings and serve customers better. The result is a trade-off between privacy and customization  in which neither complete privacy nor complete lack of privacy is preferred. Better analytical models are needed to more completely model this inherent conflict, and to derive optimal management policies that can steer around this trade-off. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Marketing to Computers</head><p>Marketers are used to marketing to people, but increasingly the customer will not be human <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Rust 1997)</ref>. For example, many computerized agents exist that make buying decisions, or at least consideration set decisions, for their human masters. In such a case, marketing to a computer is necessary. So far, efforts related to marketing to computers has involved finding out the algorithms that the computers use, and then addressing the algorithms directly. As algorithms become more complex, or as they become less easy to describe (e.g., neural networks), this approach to marketing to computers will become increasingly obsolete. We need to devise a science of "computer behavior" in which simplifying behavioral rules and heuristics can be discovered that do not require knowledge of the exact algorithms employed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bradlow and Schmittlein (2000)</ref> provide a glimpse of what such an approach will look like by studying the design of a webpage that is effective regardless of the different algorithms used by search engines. Many of the same approaches (e.g., market segmentation) can be employed with "computerized customers" just as with human customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Real-Time Marketing</head><p>The marketing function traditionally thinks of itself as a centralized function, with decisions being made by executives centrally, and application of those decisions accomplished in a uniform way throughout the sales area. An alternative is to allow marketing decisions to be decentralized, with decisions being made at the point of contact, in real time. This has been the traditional modus operandi of field sales personnel, but the advance of information and communication technologies now is making it possible to extend this mode of marketing even to automated customer interactions. Known as real-time marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Oliver et al. 1998)</ref>, this approach requires receiving the needs of the customer, and then calculating and formulating the optimal product in real time. Although such an approach is not always feasible for many physical goods (e.g., cars), it is often quite feasible for many services. For example, for information products, reformulating the product is often merely a matter of changing bits of information, which can often be accomplished virtually free and almost instantaneously. This approach can either be accomplished with centralized databases and rapid communication, or even faster and more privately by using decentralized information storage (e.g., every customer stores his or her own data locally in a smart card or key chain storage device). Models need to be developed to show how optimal real-time marketing decisions can be made, and how customer data should be optimally stored, trading off privacy and speed against data storage capacity.</p><p>An interesting twist to the impact of technology is that with new technology, we can actually convert some services that used to be consumed only in real time to something that the customers can consume at their convenience. Services such as entertainment can now be converted into physical manifestations such as DVD and videotapes. These items can be inventoried to meet customer demand and enable consumption at a later point in time. The impact of the timing of such products on the primary service is an interesting issue to investigate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Service Networks</head><p>We are accustomed to thinking about service providers individually. Nevertheless, in many service scenarios, an entire network of service providers is required to provide the complete service that the customer requires <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ghosh and Craig 1986</ref>). An example is an airline flight. The airline provides the airplane, pilots and crew, and the passenger check-in, but the service will not be successful without the participation of many other service providers, including the food caterer, air traffic controller, refueling personnel, and security staff. We need to understand better the interactions between these different dimensions of service. For example, if different service providers have different motivations (e.g., if the food caterer wants to charge a high price for food, but the airline wants to keep prices down to please the customers), what is the best way for the service network to be managed, to guarantee all parties receive the benefits they need? What if the food caterer, for example, has multiple contact points with the customer (e.g., a restaurant chain as well as food catering)? How will that affect the service network?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">E-Service</head><p>The application of e-commerce by traditional companies has generally proceeded from the assumption that profits from e-commerce arise from automating processes and cutting costs <ref type="bibr">(Lucus 1999, Poirier and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Bauer 2000)</ref>. An alternative viewpoint, known as e-service, instead touts the ability of e-commerce to increase profits through increasing revenues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Lemon 2001, Rust and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kannan 2003)</ref>. This opens up the important research area of customer satisfaction, retention, word of mouth, and cross-selling online. We need to know not just what customers do in any particular e-commerce contact (as we see in most existing clickstream research), but also what they do (and how they perceive and feel) across multiple contacts. We need to investigate the kinds of online services that promote growth of the customer relationship, and the most effective ways to combine the online relationship with the offline relationship, with the idea that the full relationship with the customer is not complete without considering both online and offline, as well as how they interact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Dynamic Interaction and Customization</head><p>The combination of advances in communication and advances in data storage and computing results in the potential to interact dynamically with the customer, and to use that dynamic interaction to customize the service offering(s). Instead of considering customer preferences to be fixed, we might instead model how they change over time. To what extent should older customer knowledge be considered just as valid as recent information (as would be assumed by standard Bayesian updating), and to what extent should it instead be considered evidence of a preference shift? How can customer communication and feedback be used to provide a more accurate view of how preferences are shifting over time, and how should that information be combined with observed behavior? 6.7. Infinite Product Assortments Standardization has given way to product differentiation, and even to mass customization, but information services provide even more flexibility to the marketer. While typical physical products achieve mass customization capability through modularity (having individual components that each have several options, that may be combined with the other components combinatorially), information services may have virtually infinite variation, virtually free. For example, an online news website could present stories relating to European news with 23.0% frequency for one customer and 22.99487% frequency for another customer. In such an environment, to what degree should the necessary information be elicited from the consumer, to what degree should the information be inferred from behavior, and to what degree should the information be inferred from other customers? There are conceptual similarities to the recommendation agent problem (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ansari et al. 2000)</ref>, but with the added complication that a product optimization problem is overlaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.8.">Personalized Pricing</head><p>Personalized pricing is not the same as price discrimination. Price discrimination is the charging of different prices to different customers for the same product. Amazon.com, for example, ran into trouble because it sought to use customer information to more effectively price discriminate, charging different prices to different customers for the same book. The Amazon.com problem will not always occur. For example, in the world of information services, often the products themselves are personalized (see §6.7). This makes the issue one of personalizing the price for a personalized product that may not be directly comparable to any other customer's product. How can information about the customer relationship be used to set the optimal price for personalized products? 6.9. Dynamic Marketing Interventions Models in CRM The general marketing interventions problem in CRM may be viewed as the following: determine fully personalized levels of marketing interventions, using multiple marketing interventions over time, in such a way as to maximize CLV. We might refer to this as the "Holy Grail" model of CRM. What makes this model difficult is the issue of endogeneity. If we sort customers according to CLV, then that implicitly assumes that the marketing interventions mix will be as it was historically, yet using the CLV estimates to change the marketing intervention mix will itself alter the CLV. Models exist that can optimize personalized marketing intervention levels over time for one type of intervention (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wansbeek 1995, Gonul and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Shi 1998)</ref>, provide individual-level models of future purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Schmittlein and Peterson 1994)</ref>, provide multiple marketing intervention levels by ignoring important aspects of endogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Venkatesan and Kumar 2004)</ref>, or provide fully personalized marketing intervention levels that maximize intermediateterm profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Rust and Verhoef 2005)</ref>. What is missing is a model that puts all of these elements together. We need a model with the following characteristics: (1) marketing intervention levels personalized for each customer; (2) considers the effect of multiple marketing interventions; (3) maximizes CLV, at least up to an arbitrary time horizon; and (4) fully addresses the endogeneity issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.10.">Dynamic Customer Satisfaction Management</head><p>Suppose that we obtain customer feedback (directly or indirectly) that gives us information, in real time, from which we can infer the customer's satisfaction, repurchase intention, and other psychological bases of future behavior. Suppose we also know, from a study of related customers, that particular management interventions can be used to affect those psychological bases. Optimal control theory might be used to derive optimal customer-specific responses to optimize the customer relationship. Also, research has shown that the solicitation of customer satisfaction and behavioral intention measures itself impacts future behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Dholakia and Morwitz 2002)</ref>. Given that phenomenon, what is the optimal strategy for evoking customer satisfaction feedback and other measures of relationship health? 6.11. Relationships with Customer Networks Except for the family context, we are used to thinking about customers one at a time. As communication technologies become more powerful and more pervasive, however, the word-of-mouth effect becomes increasingly important <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson 1998)</ref>. In some cases, it may be possible for a company to Marketing Science 25(6), pp. 560-580, © 2006 INFORMS manage a relationship with an entire customer network, rather than with each customer separately. Suppose, for example, that an online financial services company decides to discontinue the relationship with one unprofitable member of a close network. That may cost the company several profitable customers. In other words, managing the relationship with the network profitably may require maintaining relationships with customers who are individually unprofitable. Increasingly, companies have information about networks of customers (e.g., Southwest Airline's "friends fly free") and may be able to analyze the network's data as a network. This implies that the interactions between the behaviors of the members of the network also need to be modeled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.12.">Strategic Models of Customer Equity</head><p>If the company bases its marketing on customer relationships and CLV rather than just transactions, aggregate expenditures, and aggregate sales, then it follows that the company should manage its strategy based on customer equity, the sum of the CLVs of the firm's current and future customers. Although some models exist for addressing this strategy problem (e.g., , there is much more work to do. For example, some strategic initiatives may affect more than one driver of customer equity (e.g., service quality initiatives may improve brand equity as well as value equity over time). How is customer response heterogeneity best handled in customer equity models? How can customer equity strategy be developed from observable behavioral data without requiring customer survey data? Also necessary are models of customer equity that cover a customer's relationships with a portfolio of the company's products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.13.">Changes in Customer Profitability Over Time</head><p>Customer equity models are based on the ability to predict a customer's future profitability. Although some early attempts exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Campbell and Frei 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Donkers et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Reinartz and Kumar 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, 2002</ref>, considerable additional work is necessary. Complicating the problem is that marketing interventions change future profitability. This implies that an optimal marketing intervention model needs to be overlaid on the CLV model, which is a difficult task. Early attempts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Venkatesan and Kumar 2004)</ref> do not fully model this endogeneity. A good first step is to understand how and why customer profitability changes over time, as a function of both personal history and marketing interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.14.">Cross-Selling and CLV</head><p>If the company's relationship with a customer involves more than one product, as is commonplace in financial service, for instance, then the ability of the firm to cross-sell the customer becomes very important to the CLV. We need to have a more complete understanding of how cross-selling works, and to what degree the relationship is more than the sum of its parts. This has a downside too. To what degree does dissatisfaction with one of the firm's products damage the customer's relationship with the other products with which the customer has a relationship?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Inexorable technological forces make service and relationships more important over time in every developed economy. This makes the subject area of service and relationships a particularly important one for marketing scientists. These same trends, manifested by improvements in computing, data storage, and communications, make the service and relationships research area especially amenable to both analytical and empirical modeling by marketing scientists. As a result, it seems inevitable that the area of service and relationships will continue to grow in importance in marketing science research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1Principal Areas of Research in Service and Relationships</figDesc></figure>
