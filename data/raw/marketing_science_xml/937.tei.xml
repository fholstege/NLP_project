<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Many industries are characterized by a network effect, under which the value of a product to each user increases with the number of users <ref type="bibr">Shapiro 1985, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Farrell and Saloner 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liebowitz and Margolis 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shapiro and Varian 1999)</ref>. Examples of markets with a network effect include communication devices (e.g., fax machines and modems), communication services (e.g., telephone, e-mail, and Internet online services), and complementary products (e.g., VCRs, PCs, video-game players, CD players, and DVD players). Several recent papers have addressed some important strategic issues involving the network effect, such as pricing <ref type="bibr">Oren 1985, Xie and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sirbu 1995)</ref>, discontinuous innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dhebar 1995)</ref>, indirect network effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gupta et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Basu et al. 2003</ref>, product upgrades <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Padmanabhan et al. 1997)</ref>, knowledge management <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ofek and Sarvary 2001)</ref>, success of high-tech products <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yin 2001)</ref>, advertising strategy in the presence of standards competition <ref type="bibr">(Chakravarti and Xie 2004)</ref>, asymmetric network effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shankar and Bayus 2003)</ref>, cross-market net-work effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen and Xie 2003)</ref>, and effect of network effects on pioneer survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Srinivasan et al. 2004)</ref>. This paper addresses innovating firms' product strategies in the presence of a network effect.</p><p>In markets without network effects, innovating firms often use legal attacks or technological power to combat or deter imitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Porter 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Teece 1986</ref>). However, in markets with a strong network effect, many firms that develop new products have lowered entry barriers by licensing their technologies to competitors or by making their design or system "open" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Graud and Kumaraswamy 1993)</ref>. Several recent studies demonstrate the counterintuitive effect of encouraging compatible entries in markets with a network effect. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Conner (1995)</ref> finds that with a strong network effect, the innovator may benefit from having a clone competitor even if the innovator can (costlessly) foreclose such competition. By incorporating a network effect into a diffusion model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Xie and Sirbu (1995)</ref> show that an innovating firm can achieve faster diffusion of its product and gain a higher profit by having a compatible competitor enter the market <ref type="bibr">Sun, Xie, and</ref>  at an early stage rather than by being a monopolist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Economides (1996)</ref> suggests that an innovator may have incentives to share or even subsidize its technology with competitors.</p><p>Building on this branch of research, this paper addresses some important unanswered questions. For example, if the innovator can benefit from the existence of a "clone" product, should the innovator produce the clone product internally via productline extension (self-cloning) or externally via the licensing of its technology to competitors? Are external and internal cloning strategies substitutable? Is it possible for the innovator to achieve a higher profit by simultaneously pursuing both technology licensing and line-extension strategies than by pursuing each pure strategy alone? Different alternative strategies have frequently been observed in markets with network effects. For example, manufacturers of video game players have adopted a single-productmonopoly strategy-each generation of video game player (e.g., Microsoft's Xbox, Nintendo's N64) has been produced by only one manufacturer and offered in only one quality. Many software vendors, however, have adopted a line-extension strategy-introducing different versions of their application software that remain compatible but vary in quality. For example, TreeAge Software offers a full version of its decisionanalysis software DATA at $495 and a student version that limits the size of models to 125 nodes at only $50. Some software vendors create multiple products to expand their installed base by separating their product's creation and consumption features (e.g., Adobe's free versions of Adobe Reader, a component of Adobe Acrobat). Finally, the combination strategy-simultaneously offering a product line and licensing technology-has been observed in markets with network effects, such as VCRs, CD players, PCs, and PDAs. For example, Palm licenses its operating system, Palm OS, to competitors such as Handspring, Sony, Nokia, Samsung, and Acer while at the same time offering a wide range of its own products. Given the array of feasible product strategies, it is important for innovating firms competing in markets with a network effect to understand the trade-offs between different product strategies along with their strategic implications.</p><p>Most of the past research on innovating firms' incentives to facilitate compatible entry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baake and Boom 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Conner 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Esser and Leruth 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Katz and Shapiro 1985</ref> has assumed a zero licensing fee. In markets with a network effect, however, we observe both free and paid licensing policies. For example, in the PDA industry, both Palm and Microsoft charge other manufacturers a per-unit licensing fee to use their operating system (Palm OS or Windows CE). The impact of a licensing fee is important because it can affect the size of the installed base of the clone products and, thus, the overall attractiveness of a technology-licensing strategy.</p><p>To better understand these issues, this paper examines four alternative product strategies available to an innovating firm: (1) a single-product-monopoly strategy, under which the innovator is the exclusive seller of the product based on its technological standard, (2) a technology-licensing strategy, under which the innovator creates compatible products externally by licensing its technology to competitors, (3) a productline-extension strategy, under which the innovator internally creates compatible products with multiple qualities, and (4) a combination strategy, under which the innovator simultaneously licenses its technology and expands its product line. We address three specific questions. First, what factors affect the attractiveness of each of the four product strategies? Second, under what conditions will each of these strategies dominate? Third, what is the impact of licensing fees on the profitability of a licensing strategy? To answer these questions, we first develop a basic model to examine the innovator's optimal product strategy in markets with a network effect. Then, we generalize the basic model to allow different licensing-fee structures.</p><p>While previous research has analyzed the benefits of encouraging compatible entry, our results reveal that such a strategy is neither the only way nor always the best way for the innovator to realize a larger installed base and a higher profit. We show that, under some conditions, product-line extension can be the optimal strategy in the presence of a network effect. In the marketing literature, product-line decisions traditionally have been driven by consumer heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dobson and Kalish 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Lilien et al. 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">, Preyas 2001</ref>. We show that a network effect creates interdependence among consumers with different preferences because the valuation of their preferred product is determined by the joint demand for the full line. In the presence of a network effect, manufacturers that offer a product line not only tailor their products to consumers' preferences but also utilize consumer heterogeneity to increase the total user base. This, in turn, increases all buyers' consumption utility. We also show that while a licensing fee generates revenue for the innovator, a free-licensing contract can lead to a higher profit. With strong network effects, a lump-sum fee is more profitable for the innovating firm than a royalty fee or a combination of the two because a royalty fee increases the licensee's marginal cost and, thus, reduces its production. Furthermore, some of our results are counterintuitive. For example, we show that it is possible for a freelicensing strategy to generate a higher profit than a line-extension strategy even if internal and external clone production have the same costs. While a licensing fee generates revenue for the innovator, a free-licensing contract can lead to a higher profit. We also show that the strength of a network effect is not always the dominant factor in determining the superiority of a paid-licensing contract versus a freelicensing contract. Network effects become a key factor only when the value of the clone product is low or its cost is high.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a model to analyze the alternative product strategies. Section 3 derives conditions under which each strategy dominates the others. Section 4 examines the impact of licensing fees, and §5 summarizes our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Model</head><p>Consider an innovating firm that has developed a new product based on its proprietary technology. To build a larger installed base of users of its standard, the innovator may want to create a vertically differentiated but compatible product. Following the literature on network effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Conner 1995)</ref>, we call such a product a "clone" product, which differs from the innovator's current product in quality and performance, but is compatible in interface either with the user or with the complimentary software or hardware. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Assumptions</head><p>Previous research has generally accepted the assumption of a fulfilled consumer expectation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Katz and Shapiro 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Economides 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Bental and Spiegel 1995</ref>. To capture the dependence between consumers' expected network sizes and their purchase decisions in a static model, previous research has assumed that consumers make their purchase decisions before the actual network size is known (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shapiro 1985, Economides 1996)</ref>. Quantity competition has also been widely used in the economics and marketing literature to model markets with network effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belleflamme 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, De Palma and Leruth 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Economides 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Economides and Flyer 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Katz and Shapiro 1985</ref>. We adopt these same assumptions with one notable variation: we allow the innovator to consider multiple strategic alternatives. If an internalcloning strategy (line extension) is adopted, the innovator chooses the quantity of its high-and low-quality product by maximizing the total profit. If an externalcloning strategy (licensing) is adopted, firms choose their quantity by playing a Cournot-Nash game.</p><p>We assume the existence of a continuum of consumers. Each consumer is characterized by a parameter, ∈ −M 1 , representing her preference for quality, and is distributed uniformly with the population density normalized to one. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The reservation price of a consumer, , for a given product j is defined by U K j Q j = K j + K j Q j , where K j is the product quality, Q j is the expected network size, and measures the strength of the network effect. 3 Furthermore, is assumed to be less than one to ensure a downward-sloping demand function. Each consumer demands either zero or one unit of the product. An individual will buy the product if the resulting surplus is nonnegative, and if there are multiple products available she will choose the product that offers the highest surplus.</p><p>Let K and K c denote the quality of the innovator's current product and of the clone product, respectively, where K ≥ K c . For the ease of exposition, we normalize K = 1. We allow a cost difference between internal and external clone production. We assume a zero licensing fee in §3 and allow a positive licensing fee in §4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Alternative Product Strategies</head><p>In this section, we present a basic model to examine the alternative product strategies.</p><p>(1) Single-Product-Monopoly Strategy. Let p im and Q im be the price and the expected installed base of the monopolist's product, where the subscript, m, is used to denote the case of a single-product monopoly. Define im as the preference parameter of the consumer who is indifferent about adopting the product:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">im + Q im − p im = 0 (1)</formula><p>Because all individuals who have a higher preference for quality, &gt; im , will adopt the product, the total number of adoptors is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q im = 1 − im = 1 + Q im − p im .</formula><p>Let c be the marginal cost. The innovator's profit is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">im = p im − c q im (2)</formula><p>(2) Technology-Licensing Strategy. We use the subscript, l, to denote all the variables for the licensing strategy. By licensing technology to the competitor, the innovator creates competition for its own product. When multiple products with varying quality are available, consumers with a higher will buy the innovator's product, while those with a lower will buy the clone product. Let cl be the preference Marketing Science 23(2), pp. 243-254, © 2004 INFORMS parameter of the consumer who is indifferent about buying a product, and let il be the preference parameter of the consumer who is indifferent about which product to buy. A consumer with preference parameter, , will buy the innovator's product if ≥ il , the clone product if il &gt; ≥ cl , and nothing if &lt; cl . The market is thus segmented as I 0 = −M cl , I c = cl il , and I i = il 1 , where I 0 is the set of nonpurchasers, I c is the set of consumers who will purchase the clone product, and I i is the set of consumers who will purchase the innovator's product.</p><p>Let p il and p cl denote the prices of the innovator's and clone product, respectively. Let q il and q cl denote the quantities of the two products, respectively. Let Q il denote the expected network size. Then, il and cl are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">cl + Q il K c − p cl = 0 (3) il + Q il − p il = il + Q il K c − p cl (4)</formula><p>A consumer with preference parameter cl is indifferent between nonpurchase and the clone product.</p><p>Similarly, a consumer with preference parameter il is indifferent between the clone product and the innovator product. The total user base and the innovator's user base are given by the following two equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">q il + q cl = 1 − cl = 1 + Q il − p cl /K c (5) q il = 1 − il = 1 + Q il − p il − p cl 1 − K c (6)</formula><p>where K c is the quality of the clone product.</p><p>Let c cl and c fl denote the marginal and fixed costs of the clone product. To ensure the feasibility of the licensing strategy, we consider the case in which the costs of external cloning are sufficiently low so that the clone maker will produce a positive quantity under the licensing strategy. The innovator and the clone maker maximize their profits, il and cl :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">il = p il − c q il (7) cl = p cl − c cl q cl − c fl (8)</formula><p>(3) Product-Line-Extension Strategy. We use the subscript e to denote all the variables for the lineextension strategy. When the innovator adopts an internal-cloning strategy, it faces a product-line profitmaximization problem. As in the case with the licensing strategy, the market is segmented into three sets; however, unlike the licensing strategy, the innovator offers both products. Let p ie and q ie denote the price and quantity, respectively, of the innovator's existing (high-quality) product. Let p ce and q ce denote the price and quantity, respectively, of the internal clone (lowquality) product. Let Q ie denote the expected network size. Let c ce and c fe denote the marginal and fixed cost, respectively, of the low-quality product. The innovator maximizes its total profit, ie : ie = p ie − c q ie + p ce − c ce q ce − c fe (9) (4) Combination Strategy. Unlike the three pure strategies discussed above, the combination strategy creates direct competition between the innovator and the clone maker in the low-quality product market. We present the equilibrium analysis of the combination strategy in the Appendix.</p><p>Lemma 1 summarizes the optimal quantities under the three pure strategies. (See the Appendix for proofs of the lemma and propositions.) Lemma 1. The optimal quantities under different strategies are:</p><p>(1) Single-product monopoly:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">q * im = 1 − c 2 −</formula><p>(2) Licensing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">q * il = 1 − c 2 − − 1 − c cl /K c K c − 2 − 2 − 1 − K c − q * cl = 1 − c cl /K c 2 − − 1 − c 1 − 2 − 2 − 1 − K c −</formula><p>(3) Line extension:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">q * ie = 2 1 − K c 1 − c ce /K c − 2 − c − c ce /K c 2 2 − 1 − K c q * ce = c − c ce /K c 2 − 2K c</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Optimal Product Strategy</head><p>Lemma 1 allows us to derive firms' maximum profits under different product strategies. Comparing these profits leads to Proposition 1.  We graphically present Proposition 1 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a). As shown in the figure, two key conditions jointly determine the optimal strategy: the strength of the network effect, , and the variable cost of internal clone production, c ce . The two conditions divide the plane into three areas, each representing the conditions under which one strategy is optimal.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) illustrates several interesting results. First, the single-product-monopoly strategy is optimal in markets with a weak network effect and a high cost of internal clone production. A weak network effect ( &lt; 1 ) implies a negative net gain from sharing one's technology with the competitor, while a high cost of internal clone production (c ce &gt; c 2 ) implies inefficiency in introducing a low-quality product. Hence, in markets with a weak network effect and a high cost of internal clone production, the single-product monopoly can outperform both licensing and lineextension strategies. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), the cost condition above in which single-product monopoly dominates line extension, c 2 , increases with network effect, suggesting that the stronger the network effect, the more likely it is for the line-extension strategy to dominate the single-product-monopoly strategy.</p><p>Second, line extension can be the optimal strategy in the presence of either a strong or a weak (or absent) network effect. The key condition deterring the superiority of line extension is the cost of internal clone production. In conventional markets without a network effect, line extension has two diametrical effects on a firm's profit: a positive segmentation effect and a negative cannibalization effect. Hence, line extension can be an optimal strategy in markets without a network effect if the segmentation effect dominates the cannibalization effect. In markets with a network effect, the line-extension strategy has an additional positive installed-base effect. Because the low-quality product is compatible with the innovator's high-quality product, line extension will increase the total installed base of the innovator's standard, thereby increasing the value of both products. It is interesting to note that the cost condition under which line extension is superior to the other two strategies first increases (see c 2 ) and then decreases (see c 3 ) with network effect. When the network effect is weak ( &lt; 1 ), the innovator chooses between line-extension and single-product-monopoly strategies. In this case, the stronger the network effect, the more likely it is for line extension to dominate the single-product-monopoly strategy, because under such conditions there is a significant benefit to gain from creating a compatible low-quality product (i.e., c 2 increases with ). When the network effect is strong ( ≥ 1 ), the innovator chooses between line-extension and licensing strategies. In this case, the stronger the network effect, the more the innovator can benefit from having a larger network. Due to a competition effect, the licensing strategy contributes more than the line-extension strategy to the innovator's installed base; therefore, a stronger network effect favors licensing over line extension (i.e., c 3 decreases with ).</p><p>Third, unlike line extension, a free-licensing strategy is most favorable only in markets with a strong network effect ( ≥ 1 ). The innovator faces different market structures under these two different product strategies. Under line extension, the innovator benefits from the revenues of both products, whereas under licensing, the low-quality product is offered by a competitor that competes directly with the innovator for sales. Therefore, free licensing cannot improve the innovator's profit unless the innovator can somehow benefit from the sales of its competitor. Network effects establish a positive relationship between the competitor's installed base and the value of the innovator's product. This positive relationship allows the innovator that adopts a free-licensing strategy to earn a profit that exceeds the (single-or multiproduct) monopoly profit. In the absence of a network effect, the innovator suffers a complete loss by giving the competitor free access to its technology.</p><p>Note that c 3 intersects with the horizontal axis in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), which implies that giving a competitor free access to technology can be more profitable in the presence of a very strong network effect, even if the cost of internal clone production is zero. Intuitively, if there is no cost disadvantage involved, the innovator should always introduce the clone product itself and never allow the competitor into the market. However, intuition in this case proves to be false, as Proposition 2 shows.</p><p>Proposition 2. When there is no cost differentiation (i.e., c ce = c cl and c fe = c fl ), (1) the line-extension strategy generates a smaller network size than the licensing strategy (i.e., q * ie + q * ce &lt; q * il + q * cl ), and (2) it is possible for the licensing strategy to dominate the line-extension strategy.</p><p>Proposition 2 suggests that licensing offers the advantage over line extension in generating a large network size. It is this advantage that makes it possible for the innovator to earn a higher profit under licensing than under line extension even if there is no cost disadvantage to the innovator. This advantage of licensing points to a drawback of monopoly markets that has been noted in previous research on the network effect in which it is assumed that all firms sell the same product (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Shapiro 1985, Economides 1996)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Katz and Shapiro explain (1985, p. 431)</ref>, "a monopolist will exploit his position with high prices and consumers know that. Thus, consumers expect a smaller network and are willing to pay less for the good." Proposition 2 shows that the monopolist's disadvantage in generating network size occurs even if quality differentiation is possible. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Thus far we have considered two alternative strategies for building the installed base: licensing and line extension. These two strategies do not necessarily have to be exclusive. As Proposition 3 shows, under some conditions it is more beneficial to adopt both strategies simultaneously. Let * i+ denote the innovator's profit under the combination strategy.</p><p>Proposition 3. The combination strategy is optimal in markets with a very strong network effect and an intermediate variable cost of internal clone production. Mathematically, there exist 2 , c 4 , and c 5 such that * i+ &gt; max * im * ie * il , when &gt; 2 and c 5 &lt; c ce &lt; c 4 , where 2 ≥ 1 ( 1 is given in Proposition 1). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) graphically presents the results in Proposition 3. It shows that the minimum network effect required for the combination strategy to be optimal is &gt; 2 , whereas the minimal network effect required for the licensing strategy is &gt; 1 , where 2 &gt; 1 . This suggests that a stronger network effect is required for the combination strategy to be optimal than for the pure licensing strategy. The combination strategy creates competition between the high-and low-end markets and within the low-end market, while the licensing strategy creates the former but not the latter; hence, a stronger positive network effect is necessary for the combination strategy to ensure the profitability of introducing additional competition. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) also shows that a combination strategy requires an intermediate variable cost of internal clone production, c ce . The upper-bound cost condition, c ce &lt; c 4 , is necessary to ensure the superiority of the combination strategy over the pure licensing strategy and the lower-bound cost condition, c ce &gt; c 5 , is necessary to ensure the superiority of the combination strategy over pure line extension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Impact of Licensing Fee</head><p>Innovating firms often have a choice between a freeand a paid-licensing strategy. In this section, we assume that the licensor can charge a fee for the use of its technology. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We consider two fee structures: (a) a royalty of f per unit of production of the licensee, and (b) a fixed lump sum fee of F . We examine the impact of a licensing fee on the innovators' product strategy. Given the licensing fee, the firms engage in a Courtnot-Nash game as described in §2. We add a "check" on all variables of a paid-licensing strategy. To ensure the feasibility of a paid-licensing strategy, we consider the case in which the royalty fee is low enough to lead to a positive quantity of clone production. To simplify the exposition and focus on the comparison between monopoly and licensing strategies, we assume that c fl = 0 and c ce ≥ c 2 .</p></div>

A positive royalty fee weakens the conditions under which a licensing strategy dominates (1) a single-product-monopoly strategy, and (2) a line-extension strategy. Formally, (1) there existsˇ 1 &lt; 1 and f &gt; 0 such thatˇ il ≥ im if ≥ˇ 1 , and (2) there existsč 3 ≤ c 3 and f &gt; 0 such thatˇ il ≥ ie if c ce ≥č 3 .</p><p>Proposition 1 shows that sharing its technology freely with the competitor will hurt the innovator if the network effect is weak (i.e., &lt; 1 ). Proposition 4 implies that, when combined with a positive royalty fee, the licensing strategy can dominate the singleproduct monopoly even in markets with a weak network effect (i.e., 1 &gt; &gt;ˇ 1 ). A paid-licensing strategy requires a weaker network effect condition because with a positive royalty fee, the innovator benefits from clone production not only from the installed base effect but also from the royalty payment. For the same reason, to dominate a line-extension strategy, a paid-licensing strategy requires a weaker cost condition (i.e., c ce &gt;č 3 ) than a free-licensing strategy (i.e., c ce &gt; c 3 , where c 3 ≥č 3 ).</p><p>Next, we compare the innovator's profit under a paid-licensing strategy (ˇ il ) with that under a freelicensing strategy ( il ). Proposition 5 follows.</p><p>Proposition 5. When the quality of the clone product is sufficiently high and the cost of the clone product is sufficiently low, a paid-licensing strategy is always more profitable than a free-licensing strategy. Otherwise, a freelicensing strategy can be more profitable when the network effect is very high.</p><p>On the one hand, a positive royalty fee can help the innovator, who receives a direct royalty payment from the licensee. On the other hand, a positive royalty fee may also hurt the innovator because a royalty fee decreases the profit margin of the clone product. As a result, the licensee will choose to sell a smaller quantity of the clone product at a higher price under a paid-licensing contract than it would under a freelicensing contract. The net impact of a royalty fee depends on the trade-off of the two opposite effects.</p><p>When the clone product has both a sufficiently high quality and a sufficiently low cost, the profit margin of the clone product is sufficiently high and the clone production may not be unduly sensitive to the royalty fee. When the clone product has either a low quality or a high cost, its profit margin is low, and therefore the clone production will be more sensitive to the royalty fee. However, the impact of reduced clone production on the innovator's profit depends on the strength of the network effect. Strong network effects favor the free-licensing strategy while weak network effects favor the paid-licensing strategy. This is because the installed base generated by the clone maker is more important to the innovator when network effects are strong than when they are weak.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Lump-Sum Licensing Fee</head><p>We now allow the innovator to charge a lump-sum licensing fee in addition to a royalty fee per unit sold. Letˇ il f F denote the innovator's profit under a royalty fee, f , and a lump-sum fee, F . In Proposition 6 we show that in the presence of strong network effects, the innovator prefers to charge a zero royalty fee but a positive lump-sum fee. Proposition 6. In the presence of strong network effects, when a lump-sum licensing fee is feasible, the innovator will benefit by charging a lump-sum fee with no royalty fee. Formally, when ≥ 1 , for any given lump-sum fee F &gt; 0, and royalty fee, f &gt; 0, there exists a lump-sum fee, F &gt; 0, such thatˇ il 0 F ≥ˇ il f F .</p><p>Proposition 6 implies that a lump-sum fee structure is superior to a royalty fee structure in markets with a strong network effect. This is because the licensor enjoys two benefits from its licensing contract in the presence of a network effect: a direct monetary benefit from the licensee's payment and an indirect network benefit from the licensee's installed base. The stronger the network effect, the more important the latter benefit. A royalty fee decreases the licensee's production level and, hence, the network benefit, whereas a lump-sum fee has no impact on the licensee's production level. For this reason, in markets with a strong network effect, the licensor will always benefit from a lump-sum fee structure (when feasible) more than from a royalty fee structure (or a lump-sum fee plus a royalty fee).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Implications</head><p>This paper presents several new findings regarding innovating firms' product-strategy decisions in the presence of network effects that have a number of managerial implications. First, we show that a singleproduct-monopoly strategy can be optimal in markets where the network effect is not overwhelming and the innovator's cost to produce a low-quality product is high. Video game players represent one such market. Before the very recent advent of Internet-connected game players, the dominant network effect for game players was the effect of user base on the supply of game software titles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shankar and Bayus 2003</ref> game player market, the network effect seems to be relatively weak compared to other markets with network effects created by the coupling of hardware and software (such as VCR or DVD markets) in which each consumer uses purchased hardware with hundreds of software titles (i.e., movies). Video game players, however, typically buy fewer than a dozen game titles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dhebar 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Coughlan 2001</ref>), but these few are played repeatedly. Moreover, in the video game market, the most popular games comprise a large proportion of total game sales (e.g., 15 of the 185 games produced for Nintendo Entertainment System sold more than 500,000 copies each, at which level a game is designated a "hit" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dhebar 1994</ref>)), suggesting that consumer utility of a given game platform is primarily derived from a small number of game titles. Network effects in the video game industry may also be weakened by a manufacturer's tight controls over the games <ref type="bibr">' creation, reproduction, and marketing (Dehbar 1994)</ref>. Furthermore, because the main consumption utility of a game player is excitement, video game software is designed to take full advantage of the game player's processing power and memory capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brandenburger 1995)</ref>. Hence, the perceived quality of a low-end player with less speed and memory will be very low. For this reason, the cost of a low-end player relative to its perceived quality can be very high.</p><p>Second, our results reveal that when the cost of producing a lower-quality version of the innovator's product is low, a multiproduct-monopoly strategy can be more attractive than either a single-productmonopoly or a licensing strategy. Such a product line-extension strategy is common in the software industry. Software products often exhibit network effects because the extent to which a user can exchange files with others depends on the number of people using the same software. Many software vendors have adopted a line-extension strategy-introducing different versions of their application software (e.g., professional versus student version) that are compatible but vary in quality. Another way that software monopolists create multiple products to expand their installed base is by separating their products' creation and consumption features. Thus, Adobe gives away free versions of Adobe Reader, a component of Adobe Acrobat. Because these reduced-function versions are based on existing products, their development costs are very low. Moreover, because these products are software, their marginal production costs are low. Our findings suggest that in these markets, a multiproductmonopoly strategy can be more profitable than either a licensing or a single-product-monopoly strategy.</p><p>Third, we show that line-extension and licensing strategies are not necessarily exclusive. Under certain conditions, that is, when network effect is very strong and the innovator's cost to produce a low-quality product is neither too low nor too high, a combination strategy is optimal. Such a combination strategy has been observed in various markets with network effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grindley 1995)</ref>, such as VCRs, CD players, PCs, and PDAs.</p><p>Fourth, our analysis of the strategic implications of licensing fees shows that a positive royalty fee can have both a positive and a negative effect on the licensee's profit because it not only brings revenue to the licensor but also leads to a lower installed base of the licensee's product. Contrary to our expectations, however, the strength of network effect is not the sole dominating factor in determining the superiority of a paid-licensing contract versus a freelicensing contract. Network effects will become a key factor only if either the value of the clone product is low or the cost is high. The innovating firm should demand a royalty fee for the use of its technology in high-value and low-cost clone products even if the market exhibits strong network effects. Yet, a free-licensing contract should be offered for low-value or high-cost clone products only when the network effect is strong. Furthermore, when it is feasible, the innovator should seek to charge a lump-sum fee rather than a royalty fee. A lump-sum fee does not affect the licensee's production level, whereas a royalty fee increases the licensee's marginal cost and, thus, reduces its production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Limitation and Future Research</head><p>First, like most past research on markets with network effects, this paper is based on a static model that is unable to address the dynamics of firms' strategic decisions. In practice, innovating firms may adopt different product strategies during different market-development stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bayus 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Dockner and Jørgensen 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Kopalle et al. 1999</ref>. A dynamic model will allow us to examine whether there is a window for successful technology licensing and how the timing of technology licensing may affect the innovating firms' short-and long-term profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Putsis 1993)</ref>. Second, this paper assumes a vertically differentiated market. Considering both vertical and horizontal differentiation will better capture consumers' adoption behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gupta and Loulou 1998)</ref> and the relative attractiveness of firms' strategies. Third, like most previous research of network effect, this paper assumes an exogenous level of product quality. While we show in a research note 6 that our key results about the relative attractiveness of licensing and lineextension strategies can still hold when the quality of the clone product is an endogenous variable, the interaction between product quality and strategies deserves further attention. Finally, an important subject for future investigation would be to empirically test the effects of the strength of network effect, production cost, standards competition, licensing fee, and other factors on innovating firms' product-strategy choices.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 1.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2"> Following Katz and Shapiro (1985), M is assumed to be sufficiently large to avoid having to consider corner solutions, where all consumers enter the market.3 See<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baake and Boom (2001)</ref> for more detailed discussions on this assumption.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">As pointed out by<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Katz and Shapiro (1985)</ref>, the monopolist's disadvantage found in their model (as well as in our Proposition 2) is derived based on "a model where a firm's announcement of its planned level of output has no effect on consumer expectation." To illustrate the generality of our findings given in Proposition 2, we further relax the assumption of fixed consumer expectation by developing a two-period model in which consumer expectation is affected by the observed market output. The two-period model leads to the same conclusion as that given in Proposition 2. The analysis of the two-period model can be obtained by contacting the authors.</note>
