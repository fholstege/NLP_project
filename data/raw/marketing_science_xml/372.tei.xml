<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Innovations are critical for survival, growth, and success in today's global competitive markets, especially when recession depresses sales of mature products. Making, buying, and allying are the three most widely used strategies for expanding a firm's innovation portfolio. Firms spend billions of dollars each year in implementing these three strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Booz &amp; Company (2012)</ref> estimates that the top 1,000 public firms investing in research and development (R&amp;D) spent $603 billion to make innovations in 2011. The Boston Consulting Group reports 22,700 mergers and acquisitions in 2011 worldwide, with a value of $1.79 trillion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kengelbach et al. 2012)</ref>. Concurrently, Dealogic estimates firms in 2011 spent $12.1 billion in joint ventures in emerging markets alone <ref type="bibr">(KPMG 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Despite extensive research on decisions to make, buy, or ally across disciplines such as strategic management, economics, marketing, and law <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Geyskens et al. 2006)</ref>, several aspects of the relative payoff from making, buying, or allying are still not clear.</p><p>First, prior research has not compared the payoffs from announcing decisions to make, buy, or ally within the same firm (henceforth, called make, buy, or ally, respectively). Researchers have evaluated make, buy, or ally in distinct studies using separate samples of firms (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Separate analysis may not be comparable because of differences in samples or contexts. To address this issue, the current study compares the choice of and payoff from announcements to make, buy, and ally within the same firm and time periods.</p><p>Second, prior studies have not examined whether firms learn from their past successes or mistakes. That is, do past successes stimulate adoption of the successful strategy while past failures lead to avoidance of the failing strategy? For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) recently announced a write-down of $8.8 billion from an $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corporation announced earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Worthen and Scheck 2013)</ref>. Ironically, HP similarly announced huge write-downs in two similar announcements of acquisitions, Palm and EDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Steenkamp 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Third, researchers have also not examined how a firm's past commercialization of innovations affects its strategy to make, buy, or ally. For example, are buy announcements used by firms to complement a high level of commercializations or to compensate for a low level of commercializations? Thus, the current study seeks to answer the following questions:</p><p>â€¢ What factors drive a firm to choose between make, buy, or ally?</p><p>â€¢ How do payoffs differ for announcements to make, buy, and ally within the same firm?</p><p>â€¢ What factors affect the payoff from announcements to make, buy, or ally?</p><p>â€¢ Do firms "learn" from the success or failure of their past strategies? That is, do payoffs from past strategies affect current strategies?</p><p>â€¢ How does a firm's prior commercialization of innovations affect the firm's choice to make, buy, or ally?</p><p>To answer these questions, we collect a unique data set of 3,522 announcements to make, buy, and ally for 192 firms across 108 industries for five years. We model the choice of a make, buy, or ally using a multinomial logit model with correlated responses and firm heterogeneity, and then we carry out a regression analysis of the payoff as a function of the choice to make, buy, or ally, as well as other explanatory and control variables. We employ an event study to estimate payoffs from announcing a make, buy, and ally. Our models control for selection bias, firm heterogeneity, repeated observations, and other explanatory factors. Furthermore, we create novel, dynamic measures of innovation relatedness and customer benefit using content analysis.</p><p>Marketing Science 33(1), <ref type="bibr">pp. 114-133, Â© 2014 INFORMS</ref> To simplify the terminology and for ease of exposition, we use the terms "make," "buy," and "ally" to refer to announcements of make, buy, and ally for innovations, respectively.</p><p>Our results indicate that make and ally generate positive and higher payoffs than buy, which generate negative payoffs. Nevertheless, firms continue to buy for two reasons. First, firms seem to have no memory of the payoff from buy. Second, firms tend to buy when they lack commercializations. Nevertheless, if firms choose to buy, the negative returns to a buy can be mitigated if the acquirer is experienced and the target is related and offers high customer benefit.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next four sections present the theory, method, model, and results. The last section concludes with the findings, discussion of the findings, implications, and study limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Hypotheses</head><p>This section explains the conceptual framework and builds hypotheses for the drivers of the choice of and payoff from making, buying, and allying. We begin with the definitions of the key terms and the theory for the payoff metric employed in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p>We define seven key terms relevant to the study: innovation project, initiation phase, announcement, make, buy, ally, and choice. An innovation project is  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study focus</head><p>Innovation phases the total of a firm's activities in researching, developing, and introducing a new product or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sood and Tellis 2009</ref>) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). An innovation project comprises three phases: initiation, development, and commercialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sood and Tellis 2009)</ref>. The initiation phase is defined as the start of an innovation project. An announcement is the release of information by the firm directly or by other sources about some event (e.g., to make, buy, or ally) in the innovation project. We define make as a firm's announcement that it will develop a new product or service internally at the initiation phase of the innovation project. We identify four types of makes: (1) starting a research and development center or research laboratory or innovation center, (2) starting a new process or system, (3) starting a new entity or division, and (4) starting a new project for developing a product or service. Note that a make is a promise of or intention for future innovation. We define buy as a firm's announcement to acquire a firm or part of a firm explicitly for its innovation at the initiation phase. We exclude all acquisitions undertaken for non-innovation reasons (e.g., cost considerations, tax reductions, economies of scale). We identify four types of buys: (1) buying patents, (2) buying software or technology, (3) buying research personnel, and (4) buying products or services that are modified or combined with current innovations. Note that a buy may also be a promise because in most cases the firm has to integrate R&amp;D, production, branding, marketing, and distribution, which is not guaranteed to be successful. We define ally as the announcement of joining of two or more entities, for a specified or unspecified period, to develop an innovation at the initiation phase. These alliances, which include open innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chesbrough 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, West et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Hagel and Brown 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Lichtenthaler 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Bayus 2013</ref>, comprise the following: (1) forming a joint venture with other companies to develop products, (2) codeveloping products with firms, (3) licensing of technology, (4) hiring an expert on a contract basis to answer a research problem, (5) collaborating with universities or research institutes, and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) participating in networks to develop innovations. Thus, alliances can be of three types: joint ventures, strategic alliances, and licensing agreements. Note that an ally may also be a promise because in most cases the firm has to share R&amp;D, production, branding, marketing, and distribution with its partner(s), which is not guaranteed to be successful. The term choice denotes the decision among make, buy, or ally. The literature supports the consideration of make, buy, and ally as alternatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kreutzer (2012)</ref> points out that firms are aware that these three choices represent alternative means of innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dyer et al. (2004)</ref> find that 82% of firms view acquisitions and alliances as substitutes. For example, Cisco Systems has one senior vice president responsible for acquisitions, alliances, and internal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dyer et al. 2004)</ref>. By placing all three functions under the same person, Cisco checks the feasibility of each option starting with its internal capabilities. Cisco's head of corporate development states, "[W]e make the choice between internal development, acquisitions, or alliances. At some point, I have to make the decision about what's the right strategy for us" <ref type="bibr">(Dyer et al. 2004, p. 115)</ref>. Using various criteria, Cisco decides on one of the three options <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cisco Systems Canada 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Capron and Mitchell (2010)</ref> argue that the typical firm makes one choice out of the three alternatives. They cite Eli Lilly as an exemplar of a firm that makes one of the three choices at any given time based on the firm's existing capabilities and partnership characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Logic for Event Study</head><p>Tracking the long-term success of each of these choices is difficult if not impossible because companies do not reveal the specific outcomes to each of these announcements and the causes of the outcome. To resolve the information problem, we make use of the event method. This method relies on the assumption that the stock price at a particular point in time fully reflects all available information up to that point <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sharpe 1964</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Fama 1998</ref>. The stock price relies on trades by a market of thousands of investors the world over who track the company's choices and performance. The company's announcement of a new decision reflects new information that may affect the stock price positively, negatively, or not at all. The change in stock price, if any, at the time of the announcement of a decision reflects the discounted future cash flows that the market expects from the decision, taking into account the past performance of the company, its future potential, and its competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fama et al. 1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Fama 1991</ref>. Thus, by definition, returns are future looking and incorporate the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Campbell et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Srinivasan and Bharadwaj 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009</ref>. By this logic, the stock market returns to make, buy, or ally would reflect the discounted expected returns in the future. By analyzing these returns against the characteristics of these announcements, we can assess the payoff from a make, buy, or ally and what factors drive that payoff. The use of this method is increasing in marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tellis and Johnson 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Joshi and Hanssens 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Luo 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Sood and Tellis 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">, Wiles et al. 2010</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Drivers of Choice</head><p>This section proposes the conceptual framework for the drivers of choice and derives several hypotheses. Based on the literature, three broad constructs drive choice: firm resources, firm strategy, and firm outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Williamson 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Jensen 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Kelm et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Mizik and Jacobson 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Haleblian et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Sorescu et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Sood and Tellis 2009</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the conceptual framework. The most important firm resources are its managerial and financing capability. Within firm strategy, the key constructs that drive choice are the firm's emphasis on innovation, value (creation and appropriation), and diversification. We measure a firm's innovation emphasis by its prior makes, buys, and alliances. We measure a firm's emphasis on value creation by its research and development investments and on value appropriation by its marketing investments. Within firm outcomes, the key constructs are based on outcomes of each phase of an innovation project: initiation, development, and commercialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sood and Tellis 2009)</ref>. We measure outcomes of the initiation phase by payoff from prior makes, buys, and alliances. The most important outcomes of the development and commercialization phases are the number of patents and the number of commercializations, respectively.</p><p>We next build hypotheses on the effect of the outcomes of the initiation and commercialization phases of an innovation project on choice. We focus on the firm outcome construct, as there is no prior research, to our knowledge, that has examined how firm outcomes affect choice. Performance feedback plays a crucial role in indicating whether a firm needs to maintain or change its management strategy. Firms can differ in their responses to performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(March 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Payoff from Prior Make, Buy, or Ally. The payoff from a prior make, buy, or ally can affect choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cyert and March 1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Levitt and March 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Greve 2003</ref>. Organizational learning theory states that firms are outcome oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Levitt and March 1988)</ref>. A firm observes an outcome and links it to routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Levitt and March 1988)</ref>. If a routine is associated with a successful outcome, the firm learns to continue that routine. If a routine is associated with an unsuccessful outcome, the firm learns to avoid the routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cyert and March 1963)</ref>. If firms achieve a positive outcome from a make, buy, or ally, it serves as a positive reinforcement to a firm's current strategy. This prompts firms to continue with the strategy. There is substantial evidence that outcomes affect firm behavior: good outcomes lead to organizational persistence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Miller and Chen 1994)</ref>, whereas bad outcomes lead to organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Haleblian et al. 2006)</ref>. This line of reasoning suggests the following.</p><p>Hypothesis 1A (H1A). High payoff from make in the prior year encourages firms to make.</p><p>Hypothesis 1B (H1B). High payoff from buy in the prior year encourages firms to buy.</p><p>Hypothesis 1C (H1C). High payoff from ally in the prior year encourages firms to ally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Commercializations.</head><p>Firms vary in their ability to commercialize innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chandy et al. 2006)</ref>. Commercializations are more relevant to marketing scholars and more important for marketing managers than any intermediate output <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Prabhu et al. 2005)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Hauser et al. (2006, p. 698</ref>) point out that "a firm's overall profitability results from the portfolio of products it commercializes over time and across product lines." We posit that commercialization intensity is a factor that affects buys and alliances negatively and makes positively for the following reasons. First, for firms with low commercializations, a buy allows them to gain access to the ideas, talent, and tacit and codified knowledge of targets, which eventually translates into commercializations. Second, buys and alliances allow a relatively fast means of obtaining commercializations, whereas makes take a long time to materialize into a commercialization. Much research has shown that it is desirable to bring products to market quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kessler and Chakrabarti 1996)</ref>. Buying innovative firms or partnering to obtain innovations allows firms to quickly gain access to the target's commercializable products, trusted channel relationships, and loyal customer base. This line of reasoning suggests the following.</p><p>Hypothesis 2A (H2A). A high number of commercializations in the prior year encourages firms to make.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2B (H2B).</head><p>A low number of commercializations in the prior year encourages firms to buy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2C (H2C).</head><p>A low number of commercializations in the prior year encourages firms to ally.</p><p>The Drivers of Payoff from a Make, Buy, or Ally Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows our conceptual framework for the drivers of payoff from a make, buy, or ally. We suggest two broad constructs that drive the payoff from a make, buy, or ally: firm resources and firm strategy. Under firm resources, the key construct that drives payoff is the firm's financing ability. Under firm strategy, the three key constructs that drive payoff are the firm's focal innovation emphasis, value (creation and appropriation) emphasis, and diversification emphasis. We measure a firm's focal innovation emphasis by the make, buy, or ally choice and the customer benefit, relatedness, location, and riskiness of the innovation.</p><p>We do not have specific hypotheses about the payoff from a make, buy, or ally because the literature contains arguments for both positive and negative payoffs. Instead, we merely summarize the reasons proposed for positive and negative payoffs and address these issues as research questions.</p><p>First, a make can lead to a positive payoff because of the internalization of capabilities, ownership of intellectual property, and full capture of returns associated with making <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Doukas and Switzer 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Kanter 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Cefis and Marsili 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kreutzer 2012</ref>). On the other hand, the announcement can lead to a negative payoff because of the uncertainty, huge investments, and long development periods also associated with making <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Erickson and Jacobson 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Lev 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, Nakamura 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Griffin 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">, Rothaermel and Hess 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kreutzer 2012</ref>). This study seeks to empirically examine whether makes lead to a positive or negative payoff.</p><p>Second, a buy can lead to a positive payoff because buying is characterized by the acquisition of knowledge such as new technology, talent, and intellectual property <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ranft and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lord 2000, Mayer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kenney 2004)</ref>. On the other hand, the announcement can lead to a negative payoff because disturbance in conventional routines, high transaction costs, low reversibility, risk of overpayment, and cultural clashes also characterize buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Williamson 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nahavandi and Malekzadeh 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hitt et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hitt et al. , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rothaermel and Hess 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kreutzer 2012</ref>). This study seeks to empirically examine whether buys lead to a positive or negative payoff.</p><p>Marketing Science 33(1), pp. 114-133, Â© 2014 INFORMS Third, an ally can lead to a positive payoff because allying is associated with shared risk; access to knowledge with low transaction costs; and high flexibility to enter, commit, or exit (Gomes-Casseres 2000, <ref type="bibr">Mitchell 2012, Kreutzer 2012</ref>). On the other hand, the announcement can lead to a negative payoff because allying is also associated with a lack of management attention, relationship risks, threat of opportunistic behavior, potential competition between partners, and shared returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Parkhe 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Bleeke and Ernst 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, Ybarra and Turk 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Capron and Mitchell 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kreutzer 2012</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables</head><p>We use the following control variables in our choice model: managerial capability, financing capability, number of patents, prior number of makes, prior number of buys, prior number of alliances, marketing investments, R&amp;D investments, diversification levels, and industry. Please see panel A of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> for the measures of these variables and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> for the reasons these variables are used. We use the following control variables in our payoff model: innovation relatedness, customer benefit, marketing investments, R&amp;D investments, financing capability, diversification levels, prior risk to make, prior risk to buy, prior risk to ally, location emerging markets versus developed markets , licensing agreement, target value, type of make, type of buy, type of ally, industry, and competition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We test the hypotheses by assembling data from 192 firms across 108 industries. We collect these data using the historical method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Golder and</ref><ref type="bibr">Tellis 1993, Golder 2000)</ref>. Below we detail the sample selection, data collection, and the measures of the focal variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Selection</head><p>We use four different samples to minimize any sample selection bias and maximize the generalizability of results. The samples exclude firms not listed on the American stock exchanges and financial institutions because they experienced considerable turmoil during our study's time frame. Moreover, financial innovations are inherently risky and complex. We outline each sample in turn below.</p><p>Sample 1. Our first sample is drawn from a list of the most innovative firms in the world. We include this sampling frame because the most innovative firms have an ample number of makes. We use the <ref type="formula">2008</ref>BusinessWeek and Boston Consulting Group's list of the 50 most innovative firms in the world for the sampling frame. The list includes firms from various industries. Although the list had 50 firms, we could only include 36; we dropped 14 firms because they are either financial institutions or not listed on the American stock exchanges.</p><p>Sample 2. To ensure that we have a sizeable number of buys, for our second sample, we select the 36 most acquisitive firms in the world. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We rely on the Securities Data Company (SDC) mergers and acquisitions database to extract the list. The SDC database comprehensively covers all worldwide mergers and acquisitions from 1985.</p><p>Sample 3. For our third sample, we randomly select 64 firms from the 2008 Fortune 500 list. The Fortune 500 is a list compiled by Fortune magazine ranking the top 500 public corporations of the United States as measured by their gross revenue. This sampling frame allows us to select the largest publicly held firms in the United States.</p><p>Sample 4. Our fourth sample comprises 64 firms chosen at random from the 2008 Fortune 501-1,000 list. This sampling frame allows us to select relatively smaller and publicly held firms in the United States. Samples 3 and 4 include firms that vary in their number of makes, buys, and alliances.</p><p>As a result, we have 192 firms in our sample. There is an overlap of eight firms between Samples 1 and 2. 2 This sample selection strategy enables us to compile a substantial number of makes, buys, and alliances from various industries. Firms range from large to small, from innovative to non-innovative, with low to high make, buy, and ally rates, and include marketers of products and services. This sampling strategy leads to a broad, representative set of firms and is important for the generalizability of results.</p><p>The list of the 192 firms is in Online Appendix Â§A1. For time sampling, we chose the period from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2007. We focus on this five-year period because the most recent Fama-French factors were available through June 2007, when we started data collection in 2008. The availability of the Fama-French factors is intrinsically important to our study.</p></div>

The change in systematic risk ( 1i ) attributed to the announcement is the difference between the pre-and post-event systematic risk.

The data collection procedure is described in Online Appendix Â§A3. We identify 1,174 makes, 1,331 buys, and 1,017 alliances, for a total of 3,522 announcements. All announcements are at the level of a specific innovation project of a firm. From the 3,260 announcements that we use in our multinomial logit model, we eliminate 1,671 because of confounding events. Thus, our sample for the event analysis and payoff regression model comprises 441 makes, 754 buys, and 394 alliances for a total of 1,589. This sample size is, to our knowledge, higher than all other marketing studies, which use the event study method and also run a check for confounding events. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Overall, collecting, reading, and coding all the different types of data used in the study consumed approximately 3,100 man-hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>This section describes the measures of and rationale behind the key variables in the hypotheses. The details and definition of the measures for all the other variables are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.</p><p>Payoff to Prior Make, Buy, and Ally. We measure the prior make payoff, prior buy payoff, and prior ally payoff variables by averaging the returns to the firm's makes, buys, and alliances, respectively, per year prior to the date of the current event. We use the âˆ’1-to +1-day window to calculate the returns for each event. We measure these variables over the previous year but also test for longer windows in the robustness checks. Our position for using this measure of prior payoff is as follows. When considering whether to make, buy, or ally, managers are likely to consider how the firm fared when it made the decision in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cyert and</ref><ref type="bibr">March 1963, Levitt and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">March 1988)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Commercializations.</head><p>We measure the number of commercializations by the number of new product launches per year prior to the date of the current event.

Meta-analyses for 127 acquisition studies report average sample sizes of 221 events <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(King et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>to day t up to one year and divide the same by the total of all new product launch announcements for all firms prior to t up to one year. We rely on the Capital IQ database for this particular variable. We read each entry under the category of "Product-Related Announcements" within the Key Developments feature to ascertain a new product launch. Because the database has complete coverage only from January 2002 for new product launch announcements, we use a moving window of one year for announcements from January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2007 and the maximum time available (six months to one year) for announcements from July 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>This section describes the Carhart four-factor model for returns, the model for choice, and the model for payoffs. Because we have firms' decisions that take the form of makes, buys, and alliances with known time stamps, we employ the event method to gauge the impact of these announcements on returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four-Factor Model for Computing Returns</head><p>The normal return to a stock is the price of a stock on a day minus that on the prior day divided by the price on the prior day. The expected return of a stock on a day is the return of a stock that can be predicted for that day based on a general market index such as the S&amp;P. The abnormal returns to a stock as a result of an event are the normal returns minus the expected returns for the same day. As such, abnormal returns control for fluctuations in price that affect the whole market (not as a result of the particular event of a particular firm) as revealed in movements of a market index. We use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fama-French (Fama and French 1993</ref>) and Carhart four-factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carhart 1997</ref>) models to calculate the abnormal returns. We use the cumulative average abnormal returns (CAR) in the (âˆ’1 1) window as our payoff metric. Because the model has been used in prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wiles et al. 2010, Tirunillai and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Tellis 2012)</ref>, we skip the details for brevity. The interested reader can refer to Online Appendix B for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model for Choice</head><p>Because we have three unordered announcements (make, buy, and ally), we estimate a multinomial logit choice model. Our specification allows for correlated choices. For example, a firm's make choice might be correlated with its buy choice. Our specification also allows for firm heterogeneity. For example, two firms with similar make, buy, or ally experience could develop different abilities of managing make, buy, or Here, i denotes the firm, and there exists I (i = 1 2 I) firms. The ith firm has n i observations, where j denotes the jth observation at each unique time t (which in our case is a day). Response probabilities are denoted by ijc = P Y ij = c , where Y ij denotes the jth response for firm i (j = 1 2 n i ). This response is from one of c (make, ally, or buy) choices. A column vector of p explanatory variables for the jth observation for firm i is denoted by x ij ; x ij includes the hypothesized variables prior make payoff, prior buy payoff, and prior ally payoff ; number of commercializations; and numerous control variables defined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. Whenever possible, we use a window of one year prior to the announcement date to calculate the explanatory variable. Otherwise, we use the prior year's value. This helps us tackle any endogeneity issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boulding and Staelin 1995)</ref>. Constant terms are denoted by c , and the effects of the p explanatory variables are assessed through c = 1c 2c pc . Here, c and c are considered fixed effects; u ic are considered random effects. We assume a multivariate normal distribution for u ic with an expectation of 0 and an unstructured covariance matrix ; i.e., for u i = u i1 u i2 u i3 , we have u i âˆ¼ N 0 . For reasons of identification, we have 1 = 0, 1 = 0, and u i1 = 0. This identification scheme results in the interpretation of parameters with reference to the first category and to be a 2 Ã— 2 matrix. In our model, the first category is make (c = 1 where 1 stands for a make). Ally is indicated by c = 2 and buy by c = 3. Thus, the likelihood contribution of the ith firm is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">l i c c = âˆ’ n i j=1 exp c + x ij c + u ic 3 m=1 exp m + x ij m + u im I Y ij =c Ã— f u u i du i (3)</formula><p>Here, f u u i is the multivariate normal density and I is the indicator function. The overall likelihood function is the product of the likelihood contributions for each firm, i.e., l i . This likelihood function consists of a product of I integrals, where each of these cannot be solved in closed form. Thus, maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is not possible. We thus resort to estimating the model using numerical integration-more specifically, by adaptive Gaussian quadrature. We use SAS to program and estimate the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kuss and McLerran 2007)</ref>. 4 Note 4 Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kuss and McLerran (2007)</ref>, we parameterize the covariance of the random effects such that (1) the estimate of the variance that our estimation does not suffer from the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption because we assume the random intercepts to be correlated across choice occasions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model for Payoff</head><p>To specify the payoff model, we first test for sample selection bias in panel data following the procedure suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Verbeek and Nijman (1992)</ref>. If we do not find evidence of selection bias, we estimate the model without controlling for selection bias. If we find evidence for such bias, we resort to procedure suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wooldridge (1995)</ref>. The details of the procedure and the results are in Online Appendix C. We find no evidence of sample selection bias. So we run a random effects panel regression analysis of payoff as a function of the independent variables, combining make, buy, and ally in one model. In equation form, we estimate the following model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">payoff it = i +buy it Ã— b +ally it Ã— a +controlsÃ— + 4 it (4) for i = 1 2</formula><p>I firms, where t denotes the time (which in our case is a day) when firm i makes a choice, a denotes ally, b denotes buy, i are random firm-specific effects and assumed to be independent and identically distributed, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> it is an idiosyncratic error, buy it is an indicator variable where 1 indicates that the firm made a buy choice, and ally it is an indicator variable where 1 indicates that the firm made an ally choice. The control variables such as R&amp;D investment, marketing investment, financing capability, and prior risk are measured before the announcement date to control for endogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boulding and Staelin 1995)</ref>. Our estimation method takes care of the potential problem of unobserved heterogeneity because we use a random effects model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Greene 2003)</ref>. We use Stata's xtreg command and the vce option to obtain firm-robust standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Each announcement type has been made within every project of a firm. Within a project, the majority of announcements (N = 3 260, or 92.6%) are either only a make, ally, or buy. We call these pure strategies. A minority of projects have a combination of two or more announcement types. We call these mixed strategies. They amount to 7.4% (N = 262) of the announcements. Our subsequent analysis is divided into two parts: first that of pure strategies within projects and then that of mixed strategies within projects. is positive definite, (2) the components of the covariance are constructed as a correlation multiplied by the root of the product of the components of the variance, and (3) the correlation is constrained to be between âˆ’1 and 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Pure Strategies Within Projects</head><p>This section presents the results of the descriptive analysis, choice analysis, and multivariate analysis of payoffs.</p><p>Descriptive Analysis. The descriptive statistics of all variables are in Online Appendix D. At the firm level, on average, a firm in our sample has made 5.3 makes, 6.6 buys, and 5 alliances. One-third of the firms (34%) predominantly use only one strategy. We define a predominant strategy as one used for 90% or more of a firm's innovations. We find that for firms that have a predominant strategy, most use buys than use either makes or alliances: 23% of firms predominantly use buys, 5.5% of firms predominantly use makes, and 4.9% of firms predominantly use alliances. Moreover, 68% of firms chose one announcement type for more than 50% of its innovations. Thus, most firms tend to favor one of the three types.</p><p>Next we analyze the payoff from these pure strategies using the (âˆ’1 1) window. We use this window because we can control for confounding events around it. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>(a) shows the mean results of the payoff from a make, buy, or ally. Note that the payoff from a buy is strongly negative and significant, whereas that from a make or ally is strongly positive and significant.</p><p>The first objection to these results is that they are across all observations, including firms who use buys sparely and those who use them intensely. The argument can be made that firms that use buys intensely may be more adept at it and may be able to earn higher returns. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>(b) shows the payoffs from buy based on the intensity of its use: firms that mainly buy, moderately buy, minimally buy, and never buy. Note that the payoff is negative and significant both for firms that use buy moderately and for those that mainly buy. Another objection to these results could be that firms that use a mixed strategy would do better because they can combine the advantages of each of these strategies: developing innovations internally when they have the expertise, allying where they lack expertise, and buying when allying and making are insufficient. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>(c) shows the mean payoff for mixed strategies. Note that mostly ally or mostly make is better than any combination of make, buy, and ally.</p><p>The next objection could be that the above strategies do not take into account the relatedness and innovativeness of the target. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4(</ref> <ref type="bibr">d)</ref> shows the payoff from a buy under various conditions. Note that a buy does best when the target is related or when the benefits to customers are high, or both. However, the mean results even in these circumstances are negative. This analysis indicates that even though a buy generally yields negative returns, those returns can be mitigated but not eliminated by buying targets that are related and that have substantially better customer benefits.</p><p>A final objection could be that the above analyses are all descriptive and mostly univariate. They do not take into account characteristics of the firm, selectivity bias in each strategy, and prior risk from the strategies. To control for these other factors, we proceed to the multivariate analysis of the payoff to strategies conditioned on the multinomial analysis of the choice of these strategies.</p><p>Analysis of Choice. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> shows the results of the multinomial logit model with random intercepts. The dependent variable is a nominal variable where the reference category is the choice of a make that is coded as 1. The choice of an ally and buy is coded as 2 and 3, respectively. To assess the simultaneous effect of the explanatory variables on the probabilities of a make, buy, or ally, 5 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> reports the marginal effects. The estimated coefficients of Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) are in the Online Appendix E. We report the marginal effects at the mean. The estimated parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> show the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of undertaking the innovation choice.</p><p>We first turn to the effects of a prior payoff from each strategy. Payoff from a prior make is positively and significantly (3.053, p &lt; 0 05) associated with make. This result supports Hypothesis H1A. However, the marginal effects both of payoff from a prior buy on a buy choice and of payoff from a prior ally on an ally choice are not significant. Thus, we do not find support for Hypotheses H1B and H1C. These results imply that firms have a memory for the payoff from a make but no memory for the payoff from a buy or ally. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> We suggest possible explanations for this result in the Discussion.</p><p>The number of commercializations is positively and significantly associated with a make (2.96, p &lt; 0 05) and significantly and negatively associated with a buy (âˆ’4 76, p &lt; 0 01). However, the number of commercializations does not significantly affect an ally. Thus, we find support for Hypotheses H2A and H2B but not for Hypothesis H2C. This result suggests that firms <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The formula for the marginal effect of an explanatory variable x p on choice c for firm i is P ic Ã— pc âˆ’ 3 c=2 P ic Ã— pc . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The effects of a prior make, buy, or ally on choice may differ if these outcomes are measured for longer time intervals. We thus reestimate the model for choice using longer time intervals, ranging from two to five years. Online Appendix F has the estimated coefficients of Equation (2) for two-and three-year intervals. Our results remain the same in terms of both direction and significance. Our results remain same using the value-weighted CRSP index (see Online Appendix G).  with low commercializations have a higher likelihood to buy than to make. Given the importance of new products and the long lead time to produce them, firms see buys as a signal to investors that they have a solution for what may be a deep strategic problem.</p><p>A firm's number of patents has no significant effect on the innovation choices. Thus, an increasing number of patents does not seem to affect the likelihood of a make, buy, or ally. The prior number of makes is positively and significantly associated with a make (0.236, p &lt; 0 05). Thus, firms that focus on making continue to make. Financing capability is positively and significantly associated with buy (0.499, p &lt; 0 05). This result indicates that cash-rich firms have a propensity to buy. High diversification has a negative and significant association with ally (âˆ’0 07, p &lt; 0 05). This result suggests that highly diversified firms do not use alliances to learn new knowledge and diversify into new industries. The prior number of alliances and buys does not significantly affect ally and buy choice, respectively. This result, along with the prior result of the nonsignificant effect of prior payoffs of buys and alliances, suggests that firms forget both their buys and alliances as well as the payoffs from these announcements. Multicollinearity is not an issue in the model. The results of stepwise buildup are in Online Appendix Table <ref type="table">H1</ref>.</p><p>buy with other independent variables to test whether these other effects vary by type of buy.</p><p>The coefficient of the buy indicator is negative and significant (âˆ’2 83%, p &lt; 0 01; see Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Thus, a buy leads to a negative and smaller payoff than a make even after controlling for all other variables, confirming the simple descriptive analysis. We find that the coefficient of the interaction of the buy indicator and innovation relatedness is positive and significant (0.16%, p &lt; 0 01). This result indicates that firms can improve the payoff from a buy if the target is related to it. Moreover, the coefficient of the interaction of the buy indicator and customer benefit is found to be positive and significant (0.21%, p &lt; 0 05). This indicates that firms can improve the payoff from  a buy if they buy targets with high customer benefits. We also find that the coefficient of the interaction of the buy indicator and prior number of buy is positive and significant (1.71%, p &lt; 0 05), indicating that firms can achieve positive payoffs to buy if they have prior buy experience. The finding that the coefficient of buying a target's research personnel is negative and significant (âˆ’0 58%, p &lt; 0 05) indicates that firms should be wary of buying only research personnel, as integrating such personnel into the acquired firm may be difficult because of the employee's felt loss of independence.</p><p>As a robustness check, we include the amount paid to acquire the target in the regression model as it can affect the buy payoff. For example, firms may pay more than the target was worth to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Eccles et al. 1999)</ref>. We could only obtain the buy amount for 320 of the 754 buys. Thus, we dropped 434 observations. Moreover, we could not calculate the acquisition premium for more than 80% of the buys because either the market value or the amount paid was not available. The results are in the two rightmost columns of Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and are similar to our main model. Multicollinearity is not an issue in the model. Results of the stepwise buildup are in Online Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">H2</ref>. We find similar results using propensity score matching, which is an alternative to our modeling framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Mixed Strategies Within Projects</head><p>The prior analysis deals entirely with pure strategies of makes, buys, or alliances within a project. It could be argued that firms do best when they carry out a mix of such announcements within a project. Do such within-project mixed strategies fare better? We next address this question.</p><p>Each announcement in our data belongs to a unique innovation project. To identify mixed strategies, we need to find what combinations of make, buy, and ally were used for the same project. Also, to reduce left censoring 8 in the identification of mixed strategies, we need to find out whether another announcement for the same project preceded the announcements in our sampling window. We collect announcements for 18 months before our main window of time sampling to reduce left censoring, at least to some extent. We then identify multiple makes, buys, and alliances within a project.</p><p>We find that in 7.4% of cases (262 announcements), firms did use some mixture of make, buy, and ally within a single project. These 262 announcements relate to 87 projects. Within these 87 projects, we identify strings of related announcements to make, buy, and ally. Note that, as far as the market is concerned, the first announcement in the string for a particular project does not appear as a mixed strategy. Only the second, third, etc., announcements can be perceived as part of a mixed strategy. We next analyze the payoffs from these subsequent announcements conditional on the first announcement within a project. We use the Fama-French Carhart model to calculate the abnormal returns and report the abnormal returns of the (0 0) window.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>, panel A presents the number of announcements involving mixed strategies and the average payoff from each combination. For any mixed strategy-with one exception-we do not find the payoff from subsequent announcements significant conditional on the first announcement. The one exception is this: the payoff from a make is 0.46% (p &lt; 0 05, N = 58) when a mixed strategy comes first. Also, the last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>, panel A shows that when a make is part of a mixed strategy, returns are significantly positive and better than if a buy or ally were part of the mixed strategy.</p><p>Finally, we combine the pure strategies analyzed earlier with the mixed strategies analyzed here and present the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>, panel B. Note that our primary descriptive results remain the same for all strategies as for the pure strategies: namely, that makes and alliances yield significantly positive returns, whereas buys yield significantly negative returns (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>, panel B).</p><p>We do not pool the mixed strategies with the pure strategies and redo the logit and regression analysis because the number of mixed strategies is relatively small, the main descriptive results do not change, and the analysis of the pooled data becomes extremely complex as a result of the vast number of possible combinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Firms constantly grapple with the question of whether to make, buy, or ally. They widely pursue these strategies, spending trillions of dollars in the process. This study seeks to identify the pattern of make, buy, and ally announcements, the factors that drive this pattern, and the factors that drive the payoff from such announcements. This section summarizes the findings, discusses some key issues, suggests implications for practice, and lists some limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Findings</head><p>The key findings of the study are the following:</p><p>â€¢ Make, buy, and ally are widely used as strategies to obtain innovations, but buy is the most prevalent, followed by make and ally. Despite buy's higher prevalence, make and ally generate a significantly positive and much higher payoff than buy. Buy leads to a significantly negative payoff of âˆ’0 28%. Make and ally have a significantly higher payoff than buy even after controlling for several explanatory variables, different estimation methods, and various combinations of pure and mixed strategies.</p><p>â€¢ Firms do not use their prior payoffs from buy as a factor in their subsequent buy choice. However, they do use their prior payoffs from make in their subsequent make choice. This result suggests that firms do not have any memory of or "learn from" their prior payoffs from buy but do remember or "learn" from their prior payoffs from make.</p><p>â€¢ The number of commercializations of innovations is negative and significantly associated with a buy choice. This result suggests that firms buy to compensate for a low level of commercializations rather than to complement a high level of commercializations.</p><p>â€¢ The negative returns to buy can be mitigated if targets are related to acquirers and have high customer benefits and if acquirers have prior buy experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Key Issues</head><p>This section addresses three key questions emerging from the results: Why are make and ally consistently better than buy? Why do firms not learn from prior payoffs from buy? Why do firms buy when they lack commercializations?</p><p>Why Are Make and Ally Consistently Better Than Buy? Buy does worse than make or ally for several reasons. First, make and ally are relatively more reversible and flexible than buy. When firms buy, they incur high financial, management, and reputation costs. These costs increase the firm's separation pain, which translates to a potential lockin <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kreutzer 2012)</ref>. Second, compared with make and ally, a buy has numerous post-acquisition problems such as clash of cultures, difficulty of integration, difficulty of employee retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Nahavandi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Malekzadeh 1988, Hitt et al. 2009)</ref>, and difficulty of full exploitation of target. For example, eBay could not make a profit from its $2.6 billion acquisition of Skype in 2005, so it wrote off $1.4 billion 24 months later. Third, by the time a firm determines the target is a good buy, many other firms also make a similar determination, and the price of the target increases to match or exceed its potential value. Fourth, a buy often involves a bidding game with rivals, resulting in the winner's curse <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Varaiya and Ferris 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Why Do Firms Not Learn from Prior Payoffs from Buy? Firms may not learn from their prior payoffs for several reasons. First, firms might not consider payoffs from buys because management might believe that the costs of not buying-before their rivals-can be higher than the potential loss. Second, the absence of commercializations may create pressure for firms to buy. This pressure may lead firms to ignore or downplay their prior buys that led to poor payoffs. Indeed, our result for prior commercializations shows that firms tend to buy when they lack commercializations, even though the strategy seems not to pay off. These results suggest that firms see buys as a quick fix for what may be a deep strategic problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tellis 2013)</ref>. Third, both theoretical and empirical evidence show that more often than not, buys are followed by employee turnover in both the parent and the acquired firms (O'Shaughnessy and Flanagan 1998, <ref type="bibr">Park 2002, Krishnan et al. 2007</ref>). Thus, the memory for a buy may slowly die out. Fourth, managers may forget payoffs to prior buys because of their vested interests, such as compensation, influence within the firm, and risk of unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Trautwein 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Hitt et al. 2009</ref>). Marketing Science 33(1), pp. 114-133, Â© 2014 INFORMS Why Do Firms Buy When They Lack Commercializations? A lack of commercializations may prompt a buy for three reasons. First, commercializations are the culmination and probably the most important output of a firm's innovation project. A firm's future growth and earnings depend on its commercializations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hauser et al. 2006)</ref>. The lack of commercializations exposes firms to a bleak future. For example, facing the absence of a good position in the mobile devices market, Microsoft spent $7 billion to acquire Nokia's smartphone business, even though that firm was a rapidly declining star and prior investment in it had not borne fruit <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tellis 2013)</ref>. Second, in a competitive marketplace, rivals and new entrants are constantly commercializing new products. The lack of commercializations puts the target firm at a growing disadvantage. Third, in the absence of commercializations, a buy may offer an immediate ownership of a portfolio of impending and completed commercializations of new products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Managers</head><p>The findings of this study have six implications for managers.</p><p>First, although make and ally have uncertain payoffs in the distant future, firms should undertake make and ally and announce these events because they lead to immediate positive returns on the stock market. In our study, the total dollar value for a make is, on average, US$165 million, and the total dollar value for an ally is, on average, US$62 million.</p><p>Second, firms should take a hard look at buy, because this strategy leads to immediate negative returns on the stock market for many reasons stated previously. In our study, the total dollar value for a buy is, on average, negative US$42 million.</p><p>Third, our results indicate that firms learn from their past makes but not from their past buys. So firms should develop internal mechanisms to learn from their past experiences with makes, alliances, and buys. For example, even though HP lost out by purchasing Palm for its mobile software <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Steenkamp 2013)</ref>, it invested $11 billion in acquiring Autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Worthen and Scheck 2013)</ref>. Only 18 months later, HP wrote off $8.8 billion of that investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Worthen and Scheck 2013)</ref>. In additional analysis, we find that the average abnormal stock returns in the three-day period surrounding HP's three acquisition announcements of Compaq, EDS, and Palm is âˆ’10 35%. In absolute dollar terms, HP lost, on average, approximately $6.6 billion dollars for these three buys. <ref type="bibr">Day's (1994, p. 44</ref>) quote nicely summarizes the situation firms might find themselves in if they do not develop adequate memory systems: "Organizations without practical mechanisms to remember what has worked and why will have to repeat their failures and rediscover their success formulas over and over again." Some successful acquirers are using innovative methods to inquire about and capture the lessons from their prior buys. A global industrial conglomerate uses a wiki-style "deal room" to discuss and store prior acquisition processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Heimeriks et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, if a buy is warranted, firms can maximize the payoff if they acquire innovations related to their current capabilities. When Nokia bought Sega.com in August 2003, Nokia had built substantial capabilities in multiplayer gaming. The relatedness of SEGA's innovation to Nokia allowed Nokia to garner US$540 million in the three-day window surrounding the announcement.</p><p>Fifth, if a buy is warranted, firms can maximize the payoff if they acquire innovations with high customer benefit. Consider Parker Hannifin's buy of Airtek in January 2007. Airtek's drying and filtration equipment for compressed air enabled Parker Hannifin's global filtration business customers to enjoy a complete compressed-air treatment package from the compressor to the point of use. The customer benefit of Airtek's innovation allowed Parker Hannifin to garner US$319 million in the three-day window surrounding the announcement.</p><p>Sixth, firms can obtain higher payoffs from buys by developing acquisition experience. Experience enables firms to learn from their prior successes and failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Levitt and March 1988)</ref>. Consider the success of Cisco, which is attributed to its team of well-practiced executives and a well-tuned acquisition screening, selection, and integration process <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goldblatt 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study has several limitations that can be the basis of future research. First, we study the announcements about making, buying, and allying innovations-not the events per se. Indeed, there could be events in these strategies that are not announced. It is extremely challenging and complicated to obtain information about each event of a make, buy, or ally and its outcome. So a stream of research in marketing, strategy, economics, and finance, does treat the announcement of a make, buy, or ally as equivalent to the event (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Second, the data do not include firms that are not listed on the American stock exchanges. Future research might explore whether the same results hold for such firms. Third, we do not control for confounding events as a result of competitors' activities. No previous studies in marketing, management, and finance have controlled for competitor events. Although this limitation increases the noise in the data, it does not bias any estimated coefficient. Fourth, the primary driver for a make, buy or ally may be the infeasibility of one or more of the other options. Although we do not explicitly model this situation, we partly account for it by including prior choices and outcomes as independent variables in current choices. Fifth, we assume the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) for our empirical analysis. We acknowledge that EMH accepts that the amount of publicly available information about a firm or project can be limited and may vary across firms and projects. Sixth, our measure of an ally includes strategic alliances, joint ventures, and licensing agreements. This may be a good measure of an ally, but it is an imperfect measure of open innovation. Future research should consider richer measures for open innovation. Seventh, we do not know whether all three alternatives appear in the firm's consideration set while making the choice and whether the consideration set varies across decision points. Data limitations prevent us from measuring consideration sets. We assume that our panel of firms considers these choices at each point. Thus, our estimates may be considered conservative. All these remain promising avenues for future research.</p></div>
