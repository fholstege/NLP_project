<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The exploding growth of online word of mouth (WOM) is enhanced by the increased ability of consumers to create and access this content wherever they are and whenever they want. A proliferation of applications based on mobile devices provide consumers with location-dependent information to comment on experiences at all times and everywhere. Unlike with traditional word of mouth, with mobile WOM consumers can create reviews before, during, and after a purchase. Examples include the ability to write reviews of restaurants in mobile versions of TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Google and to send real-time thoughts in Twitter, while watching a movie. These differences in the creation process may affect the content and consumption of mobile versus nonmobile word of mouth.</p><p>Growing evidence indicates that consumers are increasingly likely to rely on information from other consumers <ref type="bibr">(Weiss et al. 2008, Ransbotham and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kane 2011)</ref>. Empirical research shows that the valence, dispersion, and volume of consumer reviews predict sales in traditional (i.e., desktop) online environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chevalier and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mayzlin 2006, Duan et al. 2008</ref>). Other research shows that online ratings tend to become more negative over time because consumers with higher evaluations tend to be the first to purchase and review products <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Li and Hitt 2008)</ref>. Still other research suggests that the perceived value of consumer-created content depends on characteristics, such as contribution length, review valence, and the perceived similarity of the creators and readers of consumer-created content <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Godes and Mayzlin 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Forman et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Weiss et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Chen and Lurie 2013</ref>. However, little is known about how the platform source affects the consumption value of word of mouth and how it may change over time.</p><p>From a managerial standpoint, encouraging consumers to create mobile WOM has both pros and cons. For example, mobile reviews may not benefit from reflection, and consumers may affectively respond to their current experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Miller 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, MÃ¤rz et al. 2017</ref>. Additionally, the mobile platform may encourage feedback from lessengaged customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kriss 2013</ref>). However, it is unclear whether concerns about differences in mobile content are justified and whether there are differences in the content and value of mobile versus nonmobile online WOM.</p><p>We examine these issues by proposing that the realtime creation process of mobile word of mouth should be associated with differences in the content of word of mouth created on mobile versus nonmobile devices. Namely, it should be more affective, more concrete, and less extremely positive or negative. These differences in content should be related to its consumption value (i.e., the perceived value of reading a particular review) for consumers. In addition to an indirect relationship between platform and consumption value through content, there should be a direct relationship between creation platform and consumption value. In particular, information indicating that a review was written on a mobile platform should be associated with different consumption value. Furthermore, the association between creation platform and consumption value should grow stronger over time as consumers gain experience with the mobile platform.</p><p>We explore these ideas using 275,362 reviews from 117,827 reviewers describing their experiences at 134,976 restaurants on the review website Urbanspoon. Of these, 119,880 reviews (44%) were written on mobile devices, whereas 155,482 (56%) were written on nonmobile (i.e., desktop or laptop) devices. To help address potential self-selection issues and differences among mobile and nonmobile reviewers, we examine the entire sample and a dual platform sample of 21,026 reviews written by 673 reviewers who wrote at least four mobile and four nonmobile reviews. To examine the direct effect of the mobile platform on consumption value, and how it changes over time, we compare WOM value before and after the introduction of an application that allowed consumers to write reviews on mobile devices. We analyze review content to evaluate differences in language use for mobile versus nonmobile WOM using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pennebaker et al. 2015)</ref> and a dictionary of word concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brysbaert et al. 2014)</ref>. We compare differences in rating extremity for reviews written on mobile and nonmobile platforms. We assess the consumption value of WOM by measuring the number of "likes" each review receives over time.</p><p>Our descriptive analysis finds that mobile content is more affective, more concrete, and less extreme in its valence than nonmobile content. We also find that WOM that is more affective, more concrete, and less extreme has lower consumption value. Furthermore, even after controlling for a large set of content and contextual variables, the mobile platform is directly associated with lower consumption value. In addition, the negative relation between platform and consumption value grows stronger over time. Although consumers initially value real-time mobile content similarly to nonmobile content, over time they begin to perceive differences in platformspecific content and value mobile reviews less as they gain experience with the mobile platform.</p><p>Our conceptual development and results examine how differences in the way in which users create mobile content is related to WOM characteristics and consumption value and how consumer evaluations of mobile content change over time. As such, we add to prior research on mobile consumer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ghose et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Andrews et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, MÃ¤rz et al. 2017</ref>) and research on factors that affect the content and impact of online WOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Godes and Mayzlin 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Li and Hitt 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Berger et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Moe and Schweidel 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Toubia and Stephen 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Chae et al. 2017</ref>. In this way, our research identifies a number of potential aspects that warrant further study and provides a framework for future research on mobile word of mouth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Background</head><p>We theorize that the creation of WOM on mobile platforms has both indirect and direct relationships with WOM consumption value. Indirectly, the real-time creation process associated with the mobile platform affects the content (expression and rating extremity) of reviews which, in turn, affects the consumption value of the content to consumers. Directly, the mobile platform is associated with lower consumption value. We propose that this negative relationship between platform and value strengthens over time as consumers learn about the relative quality of content created on mobile versus nonmobile platforms. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows our conceptual model and related measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Real-Time Creation Process</head><p>A distinguishing characteristic of mobile technology is greater portability and accessibility across a variety of consumer activities and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shankar and</ref><ref type="bibr">Balasubramanian 2009, Hoffman and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Novak 2012)</ref>. Mobile devices allow consumers to overcome the physical and social challenges of using computers in places without desks or wireless access, or where pulling out a large computer might be socially awkward. Mobile devices are rarely far from their owners; 72% of U.S. adults are within 5 ft. of their smartphone the majority of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jumio 2013)</ref>. Greater accessibility means that consumer activities, including word of mouth, occur in places and at times they never occurred before. Constant accessibility allows consumers to use mobile devices to spontaneously act on thoughts, desires, and curiosity by seeking information and connecting with distant others with minimal forethought <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Greater portability and accessibility means that consumers can create mobile WOM during or immediately following consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Miller 2009)</ref>. Consumers increasingly tweet real-time evaluations of movies and TV shows and evaluate food as they eat it <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Miller 2009)</ref>. They share product or service information (i.e., a restaurant review) with other consumers at the moment the product or service is consumed or available.</p><p>The real-time creation process associated with mobile WOM should make it less reflective relative to nonmobile WOM. That is, while nonmobile users generally create WOM after consumption, through retrospection and memory about the experience, mobile consumers spend less time thinking about and processing their experiences before engaging in WOM. Greater spontaneity, and less reflection, should increase the use of emotional response in evaluating alternatives. In other words, evaluation of experiences should involve more hot (vs. cold) reasoning <ref type="bibr">(Loewenstein 2000, Ariely and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Loewenstein 2006)</ref> and therefore be more affective. In other words, mobile WOM should reflect more visceral responses than nonmobile word of mouth.</p><p>Creating WOM during or shortly after consumer experiences should also reduce the psychological distance between these experiences and related WOM. Evaluating temporally near versus far events affects concerns for desirability (i.e., what) versus feasibility (i.e., how) <ref type="bibr">Liberman 2003, 2010)</ref> and the relative importance of central versus peripheral product features <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Trope et al. 2007</ref>). More generally, a focus on the present leads to a more concrete mindset whereas a focus on the future leads to a more abstract mindset <ref type="bibr">Liberman 2003, 2010)</ref>. Although work on temporal construal traditionally examines the mental representation of future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Trope and Liberman 2003)</ref>, psychological distance applies in similar ways to retrospective evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Trope and Liberman 2010)</ref>. Therefore, language used in mobile WOM should reflect a more concrete (vs. abstract) mindset than nonmobile WOM.</p><p>Finally, greater accessibility should increase the use of mobile devices in low-motivation contexts. That is, although consumers will engage in WOM on both mobile and nonmobile platforms for experiences that are strongly positive or negative, they should be less likely to use nonmobile platforms for WOM about neutraland less-memorable-experiences for which the motivation to engage is WOM is lower <ref type="bibr">(Anderson 1998, Godes and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mayzlin 2004)</ref>. In contrast, because mobile devices are always available, they are likely to be used to generate word of mouth about less-memorable experiences. This greater likelihood of providing neutral WOM suggests that mobile WOM will be less extreme, on average, than nonmobile WOM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Consumption Value</head><p>We propose that the mobile platform will have indirect as well as direct relationships with consumption value. The indirect relationship will be through changes in WOM content. The direct relationship will occur through associations between the labeling of content as "mobile" and its perceived quality. This relationship should become stronger over time as consumers learn about the mobile platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Indirect Effect of Platform Through Mobile Content.</head><p>Differences in the content of mobile WOM should be related to its consumption value to consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">MÃ¤rz et al. 2017)</ref>. Some of the relationships between content and value are challenging to predict. For example, given that emotional content increases psychological arousal and is more likely to be shared with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berger and Milkman 2012)</ref>, one might predict that WOM that is more affective should have higher perceived value. In other words, mobile WOM should convey greater emotional excitement; this should be associated with greater consumption value. In contrast, one might argue that less affective content, which suggests greater thinking and reasoning by WOM creators, will be associated with higher consumption value.</p><p>Whether concrete WOM is more or less valued should depend on its match with the social distance  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, , vol. 38, no. 5, pp. 773-792, Â© 2019</ref> between the creators and receivers of content as well as its match with the temporality of consumer decisions <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al. 2008, Zhao and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Xie 2011)</ref>. For example, given that consumers do not typically know the authors of online reviews personally, and greater social distance leads to more abstract construal <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Trope et al. 2007)</ref>, this should enhance the weight given to abstract relative to concrete content <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kim et al. 2008)</ref>. This implies that, to the extent that the real time creation process associated with mobile platforms leads to more concrete word of mouth, it should be less valued. However, one might argue that, if consumers read online reviews to help them make near-term decisions, they should more highly value lower construal level content. Such an argument would imply that concrete content should be associated with greater consumption value.</p><p>Although associations between WOM content and consumption value are subject to debate, the relationship between rating extremity and consumption value is more straightforward. In particular, if the real-time creation process associated with mobile reviews leads to more neutral and less extreme reviews, this should reduce the value of mobile reviews. To the extent that more extreme reviews provide a stronger case for choosing or not choosing a particular product and provide more diagnostic information <ref type="bibr">(Forman et al. 2008, Mudambi and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schuff 2010)</ref>, less extreme (i.e., neutral) mobile WOM should be less valued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Direct Effect of Creation Platform.</head><p>Consumers have a number of motivations for using online reviews as an information source including risk reduction, reducing search time, advice seeking, and learning about other consumers' behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hennig-Thurau and</ref><ref type="bibr">Walsh 2003, Berger 2014)</ref>. The selection and evaluation of particular information sources should depend on the perceived value of these information sources in addressing receiver needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Weiss et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As consumers develop associations between different platforms and the relative quality of information provided by these platforms, they should shift their information consumption behavior to platforms perceived as providing more valuable information. In making quality assessments, consumers should consider central aspects, such as argument quality, and peripheral cues, such as the extent to which reviewers use two-sided arguments <ref type="bibr">(Petty et al. 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Cheung et al. 2012</ref>. The association between a peripheral cue and evaluations may be incidental (akin to classical conditioning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rucker and Petty 2006)</ref> or be driven by thoughts provoked by the cue.</p><p>While the content of word of mouth should serve as a central cue to quality, and therefore consumption value, one peripheral cue that consumers may use to assess quality is the labeling of a review as "mobile." To the extent that the mobile platform is perceived as a lower quality information source, there should be a direct and negative association with consumption value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Moderating Role of Platform Learning.</head><p>When a new platform is introduced, consumers are likely uncertain about how that platform affects information value (e.g., new operating systems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Karahanna et al. 1999)</ref>. With time, consumers should learn about the relative value of the mobile platform as an information source <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ratchford et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Hsieh et al. 2011</ref>. That is, initially, consumers may see mobile reviews as novel and potentially valued information sources because such reviews may be seen as more contemporaneous with the reviewer's experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen and Lurie 2013)</ref>. However, as they gain additional experience reading and evaluating review quality; for example, assessing the extent to which their own experiences match those of the reviewer, they should develop quality associations for WOM identified as "mobile." If consumers increasingly associate mobile reviews as being of lower quality than nonmobile reviews, they should reduce their consumption of mobile reviews; more so as the mobile-quality association clarifies over time.</p><p>In summary, we predict that (1) there will be an indirect effect of platform on consumption value through content, (2) there will be a direct effect of platform on consumption value, and (3) the direct effect of platform on consumption value will grow stronger over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>To explore these ideas, we use reviews from Urbanspoon (http://urbanspoon.com), an Internet-based usergenerated content company that began in 2006. Urbanspoon provided restaurant information and allowed users to review their dining experiences. Our study period of October 2006 to November 2009 focuses on a time when the company recognized the growing importance of mobile devices. Initially, the company offered only the traditional (desktop-oriented) web interface for creating reviews. In the middle of our study period (July 2008), the company begin to allow users to create reviews using a mobile application. We focus on the period from October 2006 to November 2009 for two reasons. First, during this period, presentation of reviews from nonmobile and mobile (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) were uniform, differing only by the indicator of the source of the review. Second, we are able to observe how content consumption changes with the introduction of the mobile platform and how it evolves over time as consumers learn about the new platform. We use the variable, Mobile, coded as 1 to indicate the review came from a mobile device or 0 otherwise.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides descriptive statistics for the focal variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the correlations. Our full review data Ransbotham, Lurie, and Liu: Creation and Consumption of Mobile Word of Mouth set contains a total of 275,362 reviews from 117,827 reviewers describing their experiences at 134,976 restaurants. Reviewers wrote 119,880 reviews (44%) on mobile devices and 155,482 (56%) using nonmobile devices. We explore the entire sample and a dual platform subsample of 21,026 reviews. The dual platform subsample contains only reviews from the 673 reviewers who wrote at least four mobile and four nonmobile reviews. The dual platform subsample helps control for reviewer-specific effects that might explain differences in mobile and nonmobile reviews. For example, it might be that mobile reviewers differ from nonmobile reviewers and this, rather than differences in the creation platform, explains differences in WOM content creation and consumption. (Later models consider this potential endogeneity specifically.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Content Variables</head><p>In addition to meta-attributes directly available from the Urbanspoon data, we are interested in examining differences in WOM content. Following prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berger and Milkman 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Ludwig et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, MÃ¤rz et al. 2017</ref>, to evaluate differences in language use for mobile versus traditional WOM, we process the full text of reviews using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pennebaker et al. 2015)</ref>. LIWC measures the number of words in a given text that reflect particular linguistic or psychological processes and spoken categories of language. This number of words is then scaled to a percentage based on the overall number of words in the text. LIWC is based on writing and spoken utterances from blogs, expressive writing, novels, natural speech, the New York Times, and Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pennebaker et al. 2015)</ref>; numerous studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010)</ref> support the validity of LIWC scales to measure psychological constructs. We focus on the following attributes in our analysis because theory suggests that the real-time nature of the mobile platform will lead to differences in these measures; we use other content and context variables later (Section 3.3.2) to control for alternative explanations for the value of the review.</p><p>â¢ Affective: We measure Affective content as the percentage (of the total) of words reflecting positive and negative emotion (LIWC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pennebaker et al. 2015)</ref>. Examples of affective words are "anxious," "awful," and "sad."</p><p>â¢ Concreteness: We augment LIWC measures by measuring Concreteness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brysbaert et al. 2014)</ref>, which rates the concreteness of 39,955 words and expressions from 1 to 5 using Internet-based crowdsourcing. For example, within the context of restaurant reviews, "ambiance" has a concreteness rating of 2.31, whereas "chicken leg" has a concreteness rating of 4.82 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brysbaert et al. 2014)</ref>. We created a custom dictionary for LIWC in which words were counted in the category concrete if they had a concreteness rating of 3 or higher. (Our results are qualitatively robust to using a threshold concreteness rating of 4 as well.)</p><p>â¢ Rating Extremity: Reviewers rate restaurants on an ordinal scale (doesn't like, neutral, like, and really like).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, , vol. 38, no. 5, pp. 773-792, Â© 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, INFORMS (2010</ref>, we characterize Extreme ratings as those for which the rating is either "doesn't like" or "really like."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistent with prior research Mudambi and Schuff</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Value and Control</head><p>Variables 3.3.1. Perceived Value of the Review. In Urbanspoon, users can indicate whether the review was valuable to them by clicking on a "Like" button. We measure the perceived value of a review, Likes, through the total number of likes that a review received. This count measure has been used in other research on WOM as a measure of review usefulness (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Purnawirawan et al. 2015)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the distribution of likes per review by platform; we restrict the figure to reviews with fewer than 20 likes because there are few reviews with more than 20 likes and little difference between platforms for these reviews.</p></div>

Examples of cognitive words are "specifically," "complete," and "consequentially."</p><p>â¢ One-sided: To assess the use of one-sided arguments, we create a variable One-sided and code it as the absolute value of the difference in positive emotion words and negative emotion words, divided by the total of the number of emotion words; onesided | positiveânegative | ( positive+negative+ ) . A value of 1 indicates the review contains either only positive or only negative words; a value of 0 is equally balanced between the two. We include an arbitrarily small value, , in the denominator so that reviews with neither positive nor negative words have a value of 0 for this measure.</p><p>â¢ Social: We measure Social concerns through the use of words related to family and friends that reflect concern about others (vs. the self).</p></div>

In some models, we include reviewer fixed effects but this cuts the sample size considerably. Therefore, we alternatively include Reviewer Reviews, which is the number of reviews the reviewer had written prior to and including the focal review; we use the natural log of reviews (adding 1 to avoid taking the natural log of zero) to control for positive skew in this count variable. We also include the average number of likes received for other reviews by the same reviewer, Reviewer Popularity, and, again, use the natural log of this value.</p><p>3.3.5. Restaurant Characteristics. Some restaurants are inherently popular, increasing the number of readers but, at the same time, increasing the number of reviews competing for user attention. In some models, we include restaurant fixed effects but this cuts the sample size considerably. Therefore, we include the natural log of the number of prior reviews for the restaurant, Restaurant Reviews. We also include the natural log of average likes received by other reviews for the same restaurant, Restaurant Popularity.</p><p>3.3.6. Site Characteristics. Interest in restaurant reviews in general, and our focal platform in particular, may have changed during the study period. Therefore, we measure Site Engagement as the total number of likes for all reviews on the platform in the month preceding the review. For robustness, we considered three alternative measures. First, using Google Trends, we built a measure of interest in restaurant reviewing by gathering the relative weekly search volume of the term "Yelp," another well-known restaurant review platform. Second, using Google Trends, we built a similar measure of interest in Urbanspoon itself by gathering the relative weekly search volume of the term "Urbanspoon." Third, and finally, we considered a measure of the share of interest in Urbanspoon versus Yelp by dividing the Urbanspoon weekly search trend by the Yelp trend. This might be informative if either site had a substantial change in their share of reviewing activity during our study period. All three measures are highly correlated with Site Engagement; results are similar using any of the four measures of restaurant reviewing interest.</p></div>

We follow these with matching models and sensitivity analysis of potential bias from lack of random assignment to platform. Additionally, we investigate the possibility of differences in presentation order by platform. Finally, we consider how consumer perception changes after the introduction of the mobile platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Mobile WOM Content</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> compares the mean and median values of focal attributes for reviews created on mobile versus nonmobile platforms. Comparisons use either t-tests (for differences in means) or continuity-corrected Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (for differences in medians). We find that mobile content is more affective (t 135.76, p &lt; 0.001), more concrete (t 210.07, p &lt; 0.001), and less extreme (t â32.72, p &lt; 0.001). Results are qualitatively similar in the dual platform subsample as well, indicating that platform differences are not likely driven by differences in reviewer characteristics. While these basic comparisons do not control for variables other than the focal attribute, they illustrate that observed differences are (a) not artifacts of the more complex models that follow and (b) prevalent in both the complete sample and dual platform subsample.</p><p>Each cell of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> indicates coefficient (Î²) estimates for the mobile indicator variable from a series of regressions using the content measures as dependent variables; intercepts are included in each model but for presentation are not shown in the table. Column C1 shows the results of independent linear regressions using the natural log of each content measure as the dependent variable in the full sample (adding 1 to avoid taking the natural log of zero); column C2 includes reviewer fixed effects; column C3 focuses on the dual platform subsample only; and column C4 includes the dual platform subsample with fixed effects to control for reviewer characteristics.</p><p>Across these different models and samples, results are similar and consistent with the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Mobile content is more affective (Î² {0.256, 0.173, 0.163, 0.170}, p &lt; 0.001) and more concrete (Î² {0.381, 0.256, 0.233, 0.224}, p &lt; 0.001). For extremeness, the results are mixed: models without reviewer fixed effects find that mobile content is less extreme (Î² {â0.038, â0.014}, p &lt; {0.001, 0.01}), but models that include reviewer fixed effects do not find a statistically significant relationship. Results are similar using binary logit models for rating extremity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Consumption Value 4.2.1. Mobile Content.</head><p>We propose that characteristics associated with the review platform affect how users write reviews; these differences in content should be associated with the perceived value of these reviews. Some content differences may be associated with an increase while others may be related to decreased WOM value. Our focal measure of perceived value is a count of the number of users who indicate they like the review. We use Poisson regressions that examine how content attributes affect perceived value. (Results are similar using negative binomial models.)   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> summarizes the results of the analysis of WOM value. To control for alternative explanations, we include all content variables (i.e., past, perception, personal, informal, cognitive, one-sided, and social) beyond our three focal content variables (i.e., affective, concrete, and extreme) in all models and base estimates of significance using heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC3) standard errors (for Poisson models) or clustered standard errors (for mixed models.)</p><p>Model V0 includes control variables along with the focal content variables. More affective content is associated with a reduced number of likes (Î² â0.030, p &lt; 0.01). More concrete content is also associated with a reduced number of likes (Î² â0.145, p &lt; 0.001). More extreme content is associated with a greater number of likes (Î² 0.151, p &lt; 0.001). Creating WOM on the mobile platform is related to differences in the content (affective, concrete, and extreme). In the control model, these differences are associated with reduced consumption of that content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Creation Platform.</head><p>Even after controlling for observable review, reviewer, and restaurant characteristics, does creation platform affect review value? We propose that simply knowing that content was created on a mobile device may change its value beyond effects of differences in content. Model V1 adds the platform of creation as an additional explanatory variable and finds that mobile content is associated with reduced value (Î² â0.409, p &lt; 0.001). On average, mobile content is associated with 40% fewer likes; however, this average effect masks heterogeneous effects that we examine further. Before investigating these sources of heterogeneity, we consider a number of possible alternative explanations for this continued difference.</p><p>Alternative Modeling Choices To begin, the continued effect of creation platform may be due to modeling choices. Model V2 includes restaurant fixed effects; Model V3 includes reviewer fixed effects; and Model V4 includes both restaurant and reviewer fixed effects. All models continue to find a significant negative relationship (Î² {â0.409, â0.058, â0.075, â0.076}, p &lt; 0.001) between mobile platform and consumption value.</p><p>Sampling Alternatives Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> considers sampling alternatives using Poisson models. Heavily liked reviews could be more influential; Model S1 excludes the top 25% of reviews by number of likes. Similarly, reviews without any likes could drive the results; Model S2 excludes reviews without any likes. Mobile reviewers may differ in unobservable ways from nonmobile reviewers; Model S3 considers only reviews where the reviewer reviewed at least four times on each platform and includes reviewer fixed effects. Similarly, some restaurants may attract reviewers with unobservable characteristics. Model S4 considers only reviews in which the restaurant was reviewed at least four times on each platform and includes restaurant fixed effects. In all samples, reviews created on mobile devices continue to have lower perceived value (Î² {â0.271, â0.087, â0.116, â 0.199}, p &lt; 0.01 in all models and p &lt; 0.001 in many of these).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Matching Models</head><p>We also examine models that, for each mobile review, find a similar nonmobile review. Because content cannot be matched exactly, we use coarsened exact matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Iacus et al. 2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> describes the details of the matching process. We match on content attributes, valence, and other review/ reviewer characteristics. We match three different ways: (M1) allowing the observations to vary, (M2) enforcing the same number of matches of each type, and (M3) matching on reviewer characteristics, while allowing the number of observations to vary. The matching process results in a substantial reduction in both mean difference and imbalance (+ 1 ) along every dimension. However, this matching comes at a cost of reduced sample size. For example, because of excluded reviews for which no close match was found, the number of reviews drops from 275,362 to 14,776 in the M1 matching. However, the benefit is that for each mobile review that is retained, the sample contains a closely matched nonmobile review. Again, we find that creation on a mobile platform is associated with a decrease (Î² â0.052, p &lt; 0.001) in the perceived value of reviews (measured by the natural log of the number of likes and continuing to control for all other variables [i.e., review age, reviewer reviews, reviewer popularity, restaurant reviews, restaurant popularity, sequence, and site engagement]). Although the matching models do not establish a causal relationship, they provide additional evidence that the observed relationship is related to the creation platform rather than other observed characteristics.</p><p>Sensitivity. Our study is not based on randomized assignment of platform for review creation. As a result, despite efforts to control for alternative explanations, bias remains in our analysis. In particular, platform choice is endogenous to the decision to write a review. Therefore, we analyze the sensitivity of our results to this bias.</p><p>We first match reviews created on mobile platforms with reviews created on the nonmobile platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sekhon 2011</ref>). Then we quantify the amount of bias, Î, that would be required to qualitatively change the conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rosenbaum 2005)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> illustrates the change in significance that results from changes in bias, Î. We find that the 95% confidence interval remains below zero until Î is greater than 1.43. To attribute the reduction in perceived value to an unobserved covariate rather than the mobile platform, that unknown covariate would need to produce at least a 143% increase in the likelihood of selecting the mobile platform and directly reduce review value. Although guidelines for Î in social science  <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sen 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Display Order. Users are likely more inclined to "like" a review when the website displays the review higher on the web page. As a result, if platform (nonmobile vs. mobile) affected the display order, then the results we observe could be related to this order of presentation and not the platform itself. However, we do not have information about the order in which each user saw reviews when indicating (or not indicating) that they liked a particular review. Instead, to assess differences in ordering, using the Internet Archive's Wayback machine, we collected a new data sample of 66,257 Urbanspoon restaurant pages up until January 2015 (before acquisition by Zomato) that contained both nonmobile and mobile reviews. These pages contain 1,309,063 reviews with up to 20 reviews per page. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> displays the percentage frequency of review order position by platform. While we do not know the exact ordering for each user at the time they did or did not like a review, we do not see evidence of a sizable systemic difference in the ordering of mobile versus nonmobile reviews.</p></div>

Poisson regressions using likes as the dependent variable. Heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC3) standard errors are in parentheses. Fixed effects for the day of the week are included. All models include all text metrics (past, perception, personal, informal, cognitive, one-sided, social, affective, concrete, and extreme).

Model S1 excludes reviews with the 25% greatest likes; Model S2 excludes reviews without any likes; Model S3 includes reviewer fixed effects and excludes any reviewer without at least four nonmobile and four mobile reviews; and Model S4 includes restaurant fixed effects and excludes any reviewer without at least four restaurant and four restaurant reviews. ***p &lt; 0.001; **p &lt; 0.01; *p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Ransbotham, Lurie, and Liu: Creation and Consumption of Mobile Word of Mouth consumption value and how it changes over time as consumers learn about mobile platform content quality.</p><p>The fundamental idea behind this analysis is that the introduction of the new mobile platform in the middle of the study period allows comparison of reviews before and after the introduction of the mobile platform. In this analysis, nonmobile reviews after the introduction of mobile help control for general changes in creation and consumption. The analysis uses the dual platform subsample from reviewers who contributed at least four mobile and four nonmobile reviews.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref> shows the relationship between platform and WOM value over time. Model T0 contains control variables, text metrics, and indicator variables for each quarter. Model T1 interacts these quarterly indicator variables with mobile platform creation. Initially (in quarters 8 and 9), mobile WOM value is equal to or greater than nonmobile value. However, starting in quarter 10, the association with mobile is negative and significant; the magnitude of coefficients generally grows as time progresses, consistent with consumers learning about the relative value of the new platform.</p><p>Model T2 introduces linear and quadratic time trends (divided by 365 for presentation) instead of quarterly indicator variables. In aggregate, Model T2 finds a negative quadratic effect (Î² â0.11.702, p &lt; 0.001) trend of value of all reviews. Model T3 finds this trend does not significantly change for all reviews after the introduction of mobile.</p><p>Model T4 separates the postmobile trend for the mobile and nonmobile reviews using an interaction. The nonmobile trend does not significantly change (Î² {57.562, 30.632}, p &gt; 0.05), but the trend for mobile reviews is negative (Î² â29.814, p &lt; 0.01). Model T5 interacts all variables with the time trend to lend support to the idea that these effects are not being driven by other changes in review content, restaurants, Urbanspoon popularity, or reviewers over time. Together, these results indicate that, over time, consumers valued mobile reviews less than nonmobile reviews.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> illustrates the changes in consumption valuation over time, relative to quarter 7 of our study period (quarter 2 of 2008.) After the initial introduction of the mobile platform, the valuation of mobile reviews was significantly greater than nonmobile reviews. However, as the quarters progressed, the valuation of mobile content decreased, whereas that of nonmobile reviews was stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We propose that (1) The real-time creation process associated with mobile WOM should indirectly affect WOM consumption by changing WOM content, (2) knowing that a review was created on a mobile platform should directly affect WOM consumption through associations between the mobile label and information quality, and (3) this direct relationship should grow stronger as consumers learn about the association between platform and information quality. We test these ideas using a unique data set that identifies whether reviews were created on mobile versus nonmobile platforms and allows us to examine reviews written by the same people on both platforms. In support of the idea that the real-time creation process reduces reflection, is focused on the present, and increases the likelihood that consumers engage in word of mouth about neutral, as well as very positive and negative experiences, we find that content created on mobile devices is more affective, involves more concrete language, and is less extreme. These content differences are associated with lower perceived value. However, once source platform is considered, only extremeness is consistently associated with perceived content value.</p><p>Even after controlling for differences in the content of mobile and nonmobile word of mouth, reviewer, and restaurant characteristics, we find that mobile word of mouth is less valued. An analysis of how WOM value changed after the introduction of the mobile application shows that, although mobile WOM initially had equal or greater consumption value, over time, it became significantly lower than nonmobile WOM; presumably as consumers developed stronger negative associations between the mobile platform and its quality as a source of information.</p><p>Some of these results are somewhat different from those of prior research. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen and Lurie (2013)</ref> find that the presence of temporal contiguity cueswords such as "just got back" linking service experiences to review writing increases the value of positive (but not negative) reviews. To the extent that the real-time nature of mobile reviews is associated with higher value for positively valenced reviews-by increasing the presence of temporal contiguity cues or that the mobile label itself serves a temporal contiguity cue-our results show that these positive associations are overwhelmed by the negative associations of the mobile platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Is Mobile Different?</head><p>We find differences in mobile versus nonmobile content in every model we try.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Managerial Implications</head><p>Our results support the idea that mobile word of mouth is created in real-time using devices that are more accessible than traditional desktop or laptop computers. This leads to differences in content. Furthermore, while estimates vary by model, mobile reviews are associated with a 10%-40% reduction in the number of likes a review receives. Understanding these differences is important to managers who seek insights from mobile word of mouth and who wish to determine how to best respond to mobile users.   Two important managerial implications that our research raises, but does not completely resolve, are (1) whether to encourage people to write mobile reviews and (2) whether mobile reviews should be marked as such. Our results show that mobile reviews have lower consumption value and that the negative relationship increases over time. This argues for discouraging mobile reviewing. At the same time, the act of writing reviews may be therapeutic and help consumers make sense of their experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berger 2014</ref>)-raising value for review writers-if not for those who read reviews. Although real-time user attitudes may not persist, their word-of-mouth will. Managers may attempt to address these concerns by encouraging review writing sufficiently after service experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>While our analysis includes many measures, the creation platform may affect content variables that our analysis does not measure. There is a need for research to understand additional ways in which mobile content differs from nonmobile. Other research could examine how platform affects word-of-mouth creation and content over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Moe and Schweidel 2012)</ref>. Future research could also use examine how platform affects actual purchase behavior.</p><p>Although examining the subset of reviewers who write both mobile and nonmobile reviews helps control for individual differences that may be associated with platform choice, we are unable to isolate platform effects from contextual (such as consumption platform) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(MÃ¤rz et al. 2017)</ref> and psychological state variables that may drive the observed effects. Additionally, our data come from a single company, and other companies' experiences and management of mobile data may differ. Additionally, we focus on the early period of mobile adoption. Mobile data have significantly changed since that time and further study is warranted. However, our study identifies important differences in mobile content and value that could become stronger over time as consumers gain experience with the mobile platform. As new, technologies continue to change the user experience, and the ways in which users communicate these experiences to others, managers will face new opportunities to gain insights as well as challenges to meet consumer needs. Our study may be applicable as other new platforms emerge. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
