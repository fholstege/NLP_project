<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since time immemorial, the visibility of consumption has affected social interaction across cultures. Those with wealth have invariably indulged in ostentatious displays of their riches, be it the golden thrones of Egyptian pharaohs or the gold-embroidered coats of French nobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chaussinand-Nogaret 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Sundie et al. 2011</ref>. This type of display, referred to as conspicuous consumption, has not occurred outside the highest echelons of society for much of history; however, in today's industrialized societies, prominent middle classes possess the means to engage in slighter forms of such pageantry <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Page 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Perry 2011</ref>. Accordingly, the scope of conspicuous consumption now extends to many commonplace products, providing social benefits in addition to any intrinsic consumption value.</p><p>This social benefit, referred to as status utility in the present article, arises from the pleasure of surpassing others in wealth or social rank. By engaging in conspicuous consumption, an individual compels others to acknowledge her wealth, as made salient by her purchase. For that reason, status utility will influence consumption decisions wherever people may observe others' product selections and will vary in intensity across product categories. A consumer may evaluate thread count to infer the comfort of cotton bed sheets; she, however, cannot use thread count to flaunt social status because she is not a pharaoh receiving merchants at her throne. She must instead consume a relatively public product, such as a pair of denim jeans, to parade her wealth. By opting for a premium brand such as True Religion, she can flaunt her social status in the same manner as a French nobleman bearing gold embroidery <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hyland 2009)</ref>. Such concerns of status often influence choice in nondurable categories such as wine and fine dining. For a durable good, however, the consumer displays her choice for a much longer time horizon. Consequently, the interaction of intrinsic and status benefits particularly affects adoption of newly available durables. An early adopter often pays the steepest price when purchasing. In exchange, she does not merely enjoy product benefits before others; rather, she also enjoys exclusivity, in the sense that poorer individuals cannot afford the initial price. This phenomenon reveals itself with every iPhone releasedroves of customers endure long lines, sometimes to the point of retail stockouts on opening day <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Elmer-DeWitt 2010)</ref>. Each release introduces incremental improvements in intrinsic consumption value, allowing early adopters to update their iPhone and maintain their sense of exclusivity. Some firms, however, employ more obvious measures to address this preference of early adopters. In the luxury fashion industry, for instance, high-end brands often remove product tags before sending to discount retailers at season's end <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rosenbloom 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we examine purchase behavior and firm strategy in durable product categories affected by status utility. We construct a model wherein heterogeneous consumers decide whether to buy a durable good and, if applicable, when to purchase. This purchase timing decision relies on the product's quality, the producer's pricing sequence, and the status utility accompanying the item throughout its lifespan. Within our dynamic model, we endogenously derive both consumers' purchase decisions and a firm's optimal pricing scheme; in doing so, we help explain marketing practices when social status concerns markedly shape purchase decisions. We demonstrate that when status motivations heavily drive purchase decisions, products suffer sharper price drops over time. Furthermore, we offer a nuanced rationale as to why high-status products typically provide superior intrinsic quality.</p><p>Our paper contains obvious managerial implications. First, we help explain how status utility influences consumer choice, an insight relevant to industries such as fashion, automobiles, and consumer electronics. Second, we illustrate how consumer status needs often require firms to maintain early adopter prestige, whether through pricing or product line management strategies. Beyond managerial implications, these firm strategies possess public policy implications for issues such as luxury taxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Corneo and Jeanne 1997)</ref> and status-related expenditures among poorer households <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Charles et al. 2009</ref>), as we briefly discuss in our concluding remarks.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In §2, we review the related literature, underlining gaps in the extant knowledge on conspicuous consumption. In § §3 and 4, we outline our baseline model and present key findings, respectively. We analyze product management strategies in §5 and present extensions in §6. We conclude in §7, discussing both the contributions and limitations of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>In an extensive literature in sociology, psychology, economics, and, most recently, marketing, researchers have examined consumer behavior with respect to conspicuous consumption. One of the earliest scholars to acknowledge the phenomenon, Adam Smith, stated in his 1776 seminal work The Wealth of Nations that <ref type="bibr">[w]</ref>ith the greater of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches, which in their eye is never so complete as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves. In their eyes the merit of an object which is in any degree either useful or beautiful, is greatly enhanced by its scarcity, or by the great labour which it requires to collect any considerable quantity of it, a labour which nobody can afford to pay but themselves. <ref type="bibr">(Smith 1776</ref><ref type="bibr">/1976</ref> Likewise, <ref type="bibr">Rae (1834, p. 265</ref>) contended that consumption of an item by the "vulgar" class diminishes the "pleasure" otherwise provided; he attributed this aversion to vanity, "the mere desire of superiority over others, without any reference to the merit of that superiority." <ref type="bibr">Veblen (1899</ref><ref type="bibr">/1912</ref> popularized the term "conspicuous consumption" in his seminal work The Theory of the Leisure Class, in which he indicated that "conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure." Specifically, he reasoned that because "consumption of more excellent goods is an evidence of wealth, it becomes honorific," whereas a deficiency of such consumption connotes "inferiority and demerit." Constructing a similar argument, Simmel <ref type="bibr">(1957, p. 541</ref>) scrutinized the existence of fashion in stratified societies, reasoning that fashion "unites those of a social class and segregates them from others." These early treatises recognize that certain products, such as clothes and houses, do not merely provide warmth and shelter; rather, such items indicate the owner's status, in that society likens the owner to those with highly similar consumption choices.</p><p>Accepting that social considerations affect consumer preferences, the economics literature has formulated nonfunctional demand, the portion of demand not attributable to inherent quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Leibenstein (1950)</ref> formalized bandwagon, snob, and Veblen effects, the last of which implies that consumers will pay a premium for products that convey higher status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bagwell and Bernheim (1996)</ref> derived consumer utility conditions consistent with the occurrence of Veblen effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Becker (1991)</ref> argued that bandwagon effects can explain pricing in restaurants, plays, and other social events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Corneo and Jeanne (1997)</ref> studied the implications of snob and bandwagon effects on luxury goods taxation, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pesendorfer (1995)</ref> examined the emergence of fashion cycles. Although their contexts differ, these articles share the idea that status seeking can induce a price premium for a product, regardless of the item's quality; furthermore, these articles rationalize upward-sloping demand curves under certain conditions.</p><p>Whereas relevant economics papers congregate around the above theme, the consumer behavior literature in marketing has studied a diverse set of issues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wertenbroch and Dhar (2000)</ref> investigated the psychological drivers affecting choice between hedonic and utilitarian goods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bourne (1957)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bearden and Etzel (1982)</ref> studied the effect of reference groups in conspicuous product purchases. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Health (2007, 2008)</ref> examined how consumers succumb to social influences, abandoning intrinsic preferences in identity-relevant product domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wilcox et al. (2009)</ref> showed that Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 786-804, © 2013 INFORMS consumers are more likely to buy luxury counterfeits when brand attitudes serve a social-adjustive function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Han et al. (2010)</ref> illustrated that preference for brand logo prominence corresponds to statussignaling motivations.</p><p>The formal modeling literature in marketing, on the other hand, is somewhat limited in the area of conspicuous consumption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Miller et al. (1993)</ref> developed a generalizable model that reconciles previous fashion-related theories, including diffusion, trickledown theory, and bandwagon/snob models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kuksov (2007)</ref> assembled a matching model in which agents convey personal attributes through brand choice, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kuksov and Xie (2012)</ref> utilized a similar framework in which individuals signal social status via product selection. In a series of important papers, <ref type="bibr">Amaldoss and Jain (2005a, b;</ref> analyzed the effect of conspicuous consumption on consumer demand as well as its implications for firm pricing and product line decisions. <ref type="bibr">Amaldoss and Jain (2005a, b)</ref> demonstrated the conditions under which uniqueness-seeking consumers, existing alongside conformist peers, exhibit an upward-sloping demand curve. Examining a horizontally differentiated duopoly, Amaldoss and Jain (2005b) also determined equilibrium prices and market shares with respect to each product's quality and each consumer type's valuation of quality. Most relevant to our work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amaldoss and Jain (2008)</ref> considered the dynamic pricing policy of a firm selling conspicuous durables to "leaders" and "followers," groups that vary only in their consumption-timing preferences. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We, however, endogenously derive consumption timing: in determining her time of purchase, each consumer surveys the social status of each product user and nonuser.</p><p>In addition to these contributions, we consider the role of intrinsic quality, a key component absent from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amaldoss and Jain (2008)</ref>. The conspicuous consumption literature as a whole does not recognize quality's effect on consumer preferences and focuses solely on social benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pesendorfer 1995)</ref>. This view seemingly conflicts with the prevalence of high-quality items in conspicuously consumed product categories. For instance, Hermès crafts its iconic Birkin handbag using gold-plated hardware and saltwater crocodile skin, handsewn and polished by French artisans <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tonello 2009)</ref>. Accordingly, we jointly consider intrinsic quality and status utility to produce a more complete characterization of conspicuous consumption. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We establish product quality as an effective advertisement of social status. Furthermore, we study product management strategies that preserve this effectiveness, another point of salient departure from the extant literature.</p><p>To summarize, we contribute the following to the existing literature on conspicuous consumption:</p><p>(1) The literature has principally focused on socialrelated benefits, neglecting the effect of intrinsic quality. We jointly consider these effects, demonstrating that status utility may arise as a consequence of product quality. (2) To capture the status utility associated with an item, we incorporate each individual's social rank and consumption decision. (3) Through empirically testable propositions, we relate productlevel attributes to market-level outcomes such as price depreciation. (4) Our paper enriches the extant durable goods literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Levinthal and</ref><ref type="bibr">Purohit 1989, Desai and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Purohit 1998)</ref>, which traditionally has not considered the relationship between status utility and market-level outcomes. (5) Finally, we analyze product management strategies to preserve early adopter exclusivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model</head><p>We first introduce model preliminaries, explaining the rationale behind our assumptions as needed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists all variables appearing in our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Market.</head><p>A monopolist sells a durable good of intrinsic quality Q ∈ + over each period t ∈ 1 2 . The seller markets its product to a fixed unit interval of consumers, where i ∼ U 0 0 = 1 captures consumer i's wealth. In our baseline model, we assume individual i's wealth to perfectly correspond to her social status, although we later relax this assumption.</p><p>Intrinsic Consumption Utility. Each consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) directly reflects her wealth level i ; that is, upon product acquisition, consumer type i receives lifetime utility amounting to i Q. If consumer i purchases in period t, she incurs a price of P t , implying a net intrinsic benefit of i Q − P t .</p><p>Status Utility for Buyers. In addition to providing intrinsic utility, the durable good cues the owner's social status, producing a benefit that we refer to as status utility. This form of utility depends on two factors: (1) the consumption choices of all i ∈ 0 1 and (2) each consumer's sensitivity to others' consumption choices, as represented by ∈ + . details are largely sewn by hand, including buttonholes and split waistbands, which can be altered easily. The fabric, which costs $24 a yard, plus $3 a yard to import, is a cotton gabardine fine enough to withstand basting stitches. About two yards, counting for booboos and such, is used to make a pair of pants, so the fabric cost is $54" <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Wilson 2010)</ref>. To illustrate the effect of others' consumption choices, suppose that a continuum ¯ purchase the product. Where some i ∈ ¯ enjoy the item in the company of others, consumption forcefully reminds each j ∈ 0 of her lesser wealth. Thus, the consumption of any type j &lt; v deprives each i ∈ ¯ of an opportunity to assert her socioeconomic superiority; consequently, we expect the purchase of any j &lt; v to decrease the status utility of all i ∈ ¯ . An added individual of type j &gt;¯ , however, improves the item's status utility for all i ∈ ¯ because the higher status individual is no longer segregated from the original set of consumers. Note the difference between status and status utility: the former is an individual trait, proxied by wealth level i , whereas the latter is a consequence of both the consumption context and the adoption decisions of all i ∈ 0 1 .</p><p>Because others' consumption decisions affect each individual's status utility, we must also consider the severity of this effect, as captured by in our model. In certain contexts, consumers will be more sensitive to social effects; i.e., others' decisions will more heavily influence purchase timing. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Handbags and backpacks, for example, serve similar consumption needs, but society views only the former as a status marker. Sensitivity to status utility is thus higher for a handbag purchase, implying a higher in our model. As a general matter, we expect higher in product categories where others observe and notice consumption choices. We also note that status sensitivity will only exist when others view product use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chao and Schor 1998)</ref>.</p><p>To integrate these two elements into our formulation of status utility, suppose again that a continuum ¯ consume a product. Ignoring intertemporal considerations, status utility amounts to ¯ i d i / ¯ d i = ¯ + /2 . The addition of a type j &gt;¯ ( j &lt; v) thus improves (worsens) overall status utility, and this effect becomes more pronounces as increases. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> To map the range of consuming types into status utility, we endogenously derive the price skimming sequence of a monopolist firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Besanko and Winston 1990)</ref>. For a product sold over time, higher types will consume earlier; we can thus state, without loss of generality, that some portion i ∈ t 1 of consumers utilize the item in period t ∈ 1 2 . As a broader range of types adopt, existing consumers lose a source of segregation between themselves and those that have newly adopted. Product use no longer reminds these parties of the existing socioeconomic disparity, which decreases the sense of exclusivity enjoyed by the wealthier consumers. As indication of this effect, an individual contemplating purchase in t = 2 obtains a lifetime benefit of</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 2 i d i / 1 2 d i =</formula><p>1 + 2 /2 if she adopts. A first-period buyer, on the other hand, receives a discounted lifetime benefit of 1 − • 1 + 1 /2 + 1 + 2 /2 at the time of purchase, where ∈ 0 1 denotes the discount rate. Here, the first term captures utility attributable to the initial period of consumption, where a higher 1 denotes fewer early adopters and suggests a more exclusive subset of consumers. The latter term captures the effect of later sales on lifetime status utility; a lower 2 indicates that more low types purchase at clearance, deteriorating the exclusivity previously enjoyed by early adopters.</p><p>Status Utility for Nonbuyers. Since consumption conveys status, non-consumption underscores a deficiency of social cachet, particularly where most individuals use the product <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kuksov 2007, Kuksov and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Xie 2012</ref>). An individual that forgoes adoption in t = 2 integrates herself into the subset of types 0 2 that do not purchase. Hence, non-consumption carries a greater stigma when the marginal type 2 is lower. Again allowing each individual equal weight, product rejection in t = 2 yields a lifetime status benefit of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 0 i d i / 2 0 d i = 2 /2 . 5</formula><p>Similarly, we can show that from the perspective of an individual at t = 1, the status benefits of rejection and delayed pur-</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">chase are 1 − 1 /2 + 2 /2 and 1 − 1 /2 + 1 + 2 /2 , respectively.</formula><p>For both buyers and nonbuyers, status utility may be interpreted as an internal utility arising from Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 786-804, © 2013 INFORMS in-group membership <ref type="bibr">Heath 2007, 2008)</ref>. A higher average type denotes membership to a more selective group, where members inherently enjoy exclusivity. A rational justification of this internal utility, an individual may seek to gesture her status to others, ultimately yielding payoffs from social contacts <ref type="bibr">(Pesendorfer 1995, Bagwell and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bernheim 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Accounting for both status and consumption (i.e., intrinsic) benefits, type i acquires total lifetime utility U i t at the time of purchase. For each period t ∈ 1 2 , U i t equals</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">U i 1 = i Q + 1 − 1 + 1 2 + 1 + 2 2 − P 1 (1a) U i 2 = i Q + 1 + 2 2 − P 2 (1b)</formula><p>Each consumer is rational and forward looking, timing her purchase to maximize intertemporal utility. Assuming a fully rational consumer population, a consumer purchases in t = 1 if early adoption yields utility exceeding both non-consumption and delayed purchase. To determine the optimal period of purchase, consumer i must account for the {buy, no buy} choices of consumers j = i as well as the pricing decision of the manufacturer. Given that all consumers maximize intertemporal utility, equilibrium behavior in both periods influences the timing decision of each consumer i . With two periods in which to purchase, each consumer faces the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">max x i 1 x i 2 x i 1 U i 1 + x i 2 1 − 1 2 + U i 2 + 1 − x i 1 − x i 2 1 − 1 2 + 2 2 (2a) s.t. x i 1 + x i 2 ≤ 1 (2b)</formula><p>where x i t is an indicator variable that equals 1 if consumer i purchases at time t. Once individual i acquires an item, she does not repurchase at a later date. As before, an individual's status utility depends on the range of consumers that share her choice for each period of time. A person waiting for a lower price initially receives the status utility associated with product rejection; upon purchase, however, she receives a greater benefit in that she assimilates with higher-status early adopters. Given that the distribution of {buy, no buy} decisions affects the benefit to consumption, a nonbuyer experiences relatively higher status utility during the initial period of sales; once additional sales occur, product rejection renders a stronger indictment of being a low type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Analysis</head><p>We apply standard techniques to derive consumer and firm strategies using a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). We first write out consumers' individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints, allowing us to characterize each consumer's purchase decision as follows: 7</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x i 1 = 1 if U i 1 ≥ 1 − 1 2 + U i 2 (3a) U i 1 ≥ 1 − 1 2 + 2 2 (<label>3b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">x i 2 = 1 if x i 1 = 0 (3c) U i 2 ≥ 2 2 (3d)</formula><p>Each individual's purchase timing decision depends on the product's pricing scheme as well as her WTP. The producer, however, cannot directly observe each consumer's WTP, rendering first-degree price discrimination an infeasible strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Besanko and Winston 1990)</ref>. To exploit heterogeneity in product valuation, the producer instead applies an optimal price skimming sequence P * 1 P * 2 P * 1 to maximize total profits.</p><p>Given the consumer response to the price sequence P * 1 P * 2 P * 1 , we can aggregate purchase decisions across all i to derive demand X D t in period t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">for t = 1 X D 1 = 1 0 x i 1 d i = 1 − 1 (4a) for t = 2 X D 2 = 1 0 x i 2 d i = 1 − 2 (4b)</formula><p>Because a price skimming sequence implies that prices decline over time, demand in period t ∈ 1 2 equals a fraction t−1 − t of total consumers.

We derive the optimal pricing sequence P * 1 P * 2 P * 1 in an SPNE. First, however, we require a technical result demonstrating that constraint (3b) does not bind in equilibrium. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Intuitively, rational consumers expect a decreasing price sequence to transpire over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Besanko and Winston 1990)</ref>. Considering that consumers anticipate declining prices, a producer must allow sufficiently positive surplus for all consumers buying in t = 1; consumers otherwise postpone purchase until t = 2. Utilizing the result above, we solve for the producer's pricing strategy and establish the range of for which two-period sales occur. To determine this range of discount rates, we first note that a standard durable goods model requires that P * 1 exceeds P * 2 P * 1 . Second-period sales do not happen if this criterion is unmet because forward-looking consumers require some benefit to consumption postponement. Similarly, positive t = 1 demand requires a markedly cheaper P 1 than if the monopolist only sells in t = 2; the firm, after all, affords consumers a substitute good by selling across two periods. The producer consequently obtains a smaller profit margin under a two-period skimming strategy, relative to exclusively selling in the later period. If is close enough to 1, this diminished profit margin does not justify the benefit of immediate sales. Thus, when &gt; * , the producer sets P * 1 so that all consumers forgo purchase until t = 2. We note, however, that we restrict our analysis to pure-strategy equilibria; when &gt; * , sales could occur in both periods under a mixed-strategy equilibrium. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> For &lt; * , the consumer faces a trade-off in her purchase timing decision. If she buys now, she accrues immediate consumption benefits; if she delays purchase, she enjoys a cheaper retail price to compensate for consumption deferment. Consumers with high WTP, valuing consumption benefits to a greater degree, typically reject price discounts in lieu of immediate consumption.</p><p>Impact of Product's Social Benefits on Prices. When is relatively low, the producer sells across both time periods with a decreasing price sequence. This pricing strategy segments the market, in that wealthier individuals pay a premium for immediate consumption. They exclusively use the product for a period of time, attaching a degree of prestige to consumption during this time frame. This exclusivity increases in importance with status sensitivity; thus, more affluent types hold more incentive to purchase early, separating themselves from later adopters and non-consumers.</p><p>This separation, however, is fleeting; upon a clearance sale, some lower types ultimately utilize the same status symbol. Consumption at this juncture allows the late adopter to segregate herself from non-consumers, reminding these poorest types of their low status. This status benefit, again, rises in importance with . Where status considerations more deeply affect purchase timing, consumption provides a greater benefit relative to non-consumption. The clearance buyer receives more incentive to differentiate herself from those unable to purchase, implying that the producer commands a P * 2 P * 1 that rises with . However, P * 1 increases with at an even greater rate than P * 2 P * 1 because the early adopter also seeks to initially distinguish herself from those that delay product acquisition. Status sensitivity having a bigger impact on t = 1 than on t = 2, the ratio of P * 2 P * 1 to P * 1 declines as grows in magnitude (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Stated differently, when sensitivity to social benefits is higher, the product experiences sharper declines in price. This is formally presented in Proposition 1.</p><p>Proposition 1. Higher status sensitivity yields sharper price depreciation under a two-period skimming sequence.</p><p>Price depreciation pervasively affects durable goods markets. As identified by Coase (1972), a firm prefers an ex ante price commitment when selling its durable product over time. Consumers, however, will not view any such commitment as credible because the firm has incentive to deviate ex post. Our first finding suggests that the incidence of price depreciation occurs for all durables; in the context of conspicuous consumption, however, the severity of this depreciation depends on the level of sensitivity to status utility. Where social effects greatly influence consumption decisions, firms critically need commitment devices that maintain early adopter exclusivity. We later explore product management strategies that achieve this objective in §5.</p><p>We note that the a firm may not always require a commitment device in a setting of high status sensitivity. Although our depreciation result holds under different formulations of status utility (see §6), an opposite outcome may occur if, for example, consumers are uncertain about their own preferences. Here, a monopolist may instead use penetration pricing (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bergemann and Välimäki 2006)</ref> to induce trial and discourage competitive entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role of Quality in Determining Status Utility.</head><p>Irrespective of any external benefit, an improvement in quality directly boosts intrinsic utility. Ceteris paribus, higher quality increases demand since an expanded range of consumers prefers to purchase. A change in quality does not uniformly affect consumers, however, because wealthier types experience a more substantial shift in intrinsic utility. To exploit the WTP of this subset, the monopolist assesses a more-than-commensurate price increase. The producer effectively forfeits sales to low status individuals, allowing the firm to extract additional surplus from those most willing to acquire.</p><p>Higher quality, via equilibrium pricing, indirectly causes a more exclusive segment to purchase the product. Consuming types enjoy this greater exclusivity because product use becomes a marker of substantial wealth. Thus, in the context of conspicuous consumption, an increase in quality yields greater status utility. Furthermore, any quality improvement renders greater influence on status utility when status sensitivity is high. Consumers, in this instance, hold more incentive to separate themselves from those with lower status. This, in effect, produces greater demand and allows the producer extra flexibility in pricing a high-quality product. To sufficiently exploit WTP among high types, the producer may sacrifice a larger share of demand than possible for a product with lower . Proposition 2 formally captures this intuition.</p><p>Proposition 2. In equilibrium, product quality increases the status utility of adoption. Furthermore, product quality exerts a greater influence at higher levels of status sensitivity. That is, ∀ t ∈ 1 2 / Q 1 + * t /2 &gt; 0 and ( 2 / Q 1 + * t /2 &gt; 0. At this stage, it is useful to discuss this result in relation to Proposition 1. An increase in diminishes differences in total WTP since all consumers receive the same social benefit. Where consumers are more homogeneous in their overall product evaluation, the producer can pursue a pricing policy that expands demand. The opposite, however, occurs for an increase in quality, where differences in WTP become more pronounced. In this scenario, the producer targets those willing to incur a substantial premium for the item. Through this effect on the distribution of users, higher quality enhances the status associated with the item. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Proposition 2 conveys one of this paper's key messages. Intrinsic quality is seemingly unrelated to status utility since quality does not carry social benefits per se. Higher quality commands higher prices, however, and pricier items entail greater exclusivity; thus, superior quality indirectly generates greater status utility. Our rationale provides nuance to the past literature, where elevated prices entirely drive any notion of high status. Furthermore, our logic explains the prevalence of higher intrinsic quality among highend fashion goods <ref type="bibr">(Dubois et al. 2005, Hines and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bruce 2007)</ref>. This result also bears relation to the literature on luxury counterfeits <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Higgins and Rubin 1986)</ref>. Luxury brands subtly cue their product's quality, allowing consumers to more easily differentiate authentic luxury products from counterfeit knockoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berger and Ward 2010)</ref>. To the extent that consumers can identify counterfeit users, luxury brands help maintain the exclusivity associated with their products. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This link between status and product quality depends on two underlying assumptions. First, quality must affect intrinsic consumption utility; second, the producer must induce exclusivity through its pricing scheme. In the first instance, consumers may sacrifice quality for other product characteristics. Individuals that buy Eileen Fisher's "rugged" fair trade sweaters, for instance, pay a premium for uncomfortable fabrics because they are handwoven in Peruvian communities and do not contain any environmentally harmful chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lockwood 2012</ref>). In the second instance, people may purchase these rugged fair trade sweaters because they derive status from a prosocial reputation <ref type="bibr">(Griskevicius et al. 2010</ref>). We address this latter concern by allowing status to be multidimensional in §6. We finally note that Proposition 2 requires an intuitive assumption that marginal production costs increase with quality. Were marginal costs completely independent of product quality, our result might not apply in these scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Product Management Strategies</head><p>In the model outlined so far, lower status individuals appropriate the status item in t = 2, to the chagrin of those that purchase beforehand. These initial consumers prefer to sustain the social partition provided by an early purchase, as this allows a strong association between status and product use. Accordingly, they will accept higher first-period prices to retain the integrity of their status symbol. Many firms employ commitment devices to help preserve the prestige associated with early adoption. As an extreme example, high-end label Comme des Garçons allegedly burns or shreds its overstock, thereby preventing its availability at T.J. Maxx and other discount retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Seabrook 2012)</ref>. We, however, shall concentrate on two more common strategies. In the first scenario, the producer may utilize some form of product dating; essentially, the manufacturer markets a single product but facilitates immediate identification of a consumer's time of purchase. Examples include the introduction of "limited editions" (e.g., commemorative stamps and coins), "special editions" (e.g., Subaru Forester 2007 L.L. Bean Edition), "collector's editions" (e.g., collector editions of DVDs, first editions of major novels), and "deluxe editions." As an alternative strategy, the producer may release a new version, presumably of higher quality. Selling this item simultaneously with its price-reduced predecessor, the producer entices early adopters to update their product. Producers execute this strategy for publicly consumed electronic gadgets in particular (e.g., iPhone 5, Sony VAIO Z Series laptop).</p><p>In the discussion that follows, we first motivate each strategy before presenting a more formal analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Product Dating</head><p>In this strategy, the seller creates two distinct classes of products through the use of labeling. This strategy enables a consumer to identify each individual's time of purchase, despite the fact that product quality does not vary significantly across users. Higher types that purchase a deluxe edition can maintain a sense of separation even as the producer sells a functionally equivalent item at clearance. In that the firm does not alter its product's quality, this labeling strategy solely upholds early adopter status utility.</p><p>Under this labeling strategy, a firm typically sells its deluxe, or special, edition before marketing a regular version at a lower price. The special edition features distinctive attributes not available in the regular version, allowing consumers to differentiate the two different items. In many product categories, the manufacturer produces the special edition in a limited, precommitted quantity. Firms also announce this scarcity, via advertisements and promotions, so that consumers will pay a significant premium. For example, Toyota Motor Corporation produced only 1,500 units of its limited edition Scion 2012 xB Release Series (RS) 9.0; these vehicles came in Hot Lava, a bold color not available through the xB regular edition (Scion.com 2013). Later RS editions came in equally bold, unique colors. Yamaha recently introduced its Elton John Signature Series Red Piano, a 50-unit line of vibrant red pianos that featured the singer's autograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balachander and Stock 2009)</ref>. Aside from these limited editions, fashion brands have recently marketed "diffusion lines." This strategy, similar in nature to product dating, capitalizes on the strength of the parent brand's high-end image. To harness the parent brand's prestige, the firm offers products similar in construction; the diffusion products, however, differ in labeling and sell at discount <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schiro 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Feitelberg 2007</ref>). These subbrands, typically sold toward the end of the season, may also differ in color scheme; nonetheless, they employ the same fabric, feel, and overall look as the parent <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Passariello 2006</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiro 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Casciato 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Walker 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Zargani 2011</ref>. These fashion brands additionally utilize so-called exclusives, style modifications unique to a particular retailer.

Aware that the time of purchase can be determined, consumer i buys in the first period if and only if it is preferable to either delaying or forgoing acquisition. If she does not purchase in the initial period, i acquires the product in t = 2 iff acquisition yields greater utility than non-consumption. We expound these consumer rationality constraints, as well as the producer optimization problem, in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Analysis.</head><p>Solving for an SPNE, we require the following two technical results: (1) that the IR constraint does not bind in equilibrium and (2) that the discount factor affects the number of sales periods. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Because these results are analogous to their baseline counterparts, we relegate them to Appendix B as Lemma T3a and Lemma T3b, respectively. Unlike the baseline setup, however, this model's primitives influence , the threshold separating single-period sales from two-period skimming. Specifically, early adopters prefer product dating to the baseline scenario, and this preference grows as consumers care more about social effects. Because the producer will partially extract this surplus improvement, increases skimming profits at a greater rate than that occurring in the baseline model. Single-period profits do not change, however, since product dating requires multiple periods to be effective. Hence, as rises, the producer adheres to a two-period skimming strategy for a larger range of (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This result is formalized in Lemma T4 (see Appendix B). It allows us to derive the optimal pricing sequence P 1 P 2 P 1 and thus determine the range of fixed costs at which a producer invests in product dating.</p><p>Effect of Status Sensitivity and Product Quality on Product Dating. With distinctive styling, the limited <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Again, we emphasize that we focus on pure-strategy equilibria. edition is clearly differentiated from its cheaper, more widely available counterpart. Each individual can identify those that acquired the limited edition from those that later purchased the regular product. With the former's target segment composed of wealthier types, consumers with a limited edition enjoy a lasting sense of exclusivity and prestige. Product dating bestows a benefit to those with the highest WTP, allowing the seller to extract a substantial premium. Conversely, product dating decreases the WTP of individuals buying in t = 2 because they no longer attain the status symbol of those buying beforehand. This drop in WTP is relatively small, however, because all product users still prefer to segregate themselves from non-consumers. Under sufficiently low fixed costs, the seller thus attains a net benefit through the use of product dating. This benefit grows particularly large as consumers become more sensitive to others' purchase decisions; in other words, status sensitivity increases the payoff of product dating.</p><p>Although sensitivity to status utility strengthens the value of product dating, higher product quality impedes the use of this labeling strategy. An improvement in Q directly enhances intrinsic consumption utility and indirectly boosts status utility, as demonstrated in Proposition 2. However, in that a more exclusive subset consumes a superior item, the marginal benefit to product dating becomes less valuable. That is, a dating technology supplies lower marginal returns as product quality improves. An intrinsic quality improvement, in other words, serves as a substitute to product dating for the purpose of providing status utility.</p><p>These two effects are formally presented in the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 3. (a) As status sensitivity increases, a manufacturer is willing to incur greater investment cost toward product dating, and (b) as product quality increases, a manufacturer is less willing to incur an investment cost toward product dating.</p><p>This result emerges as a consequence of two model features: (1) the distribution of vertically differentiated consumers and (2) a social benefit dependent on each consumer's vertical type. If consumers only sought to conform, status utility would not depend on the types of those consuming; instead, utility would rise with the number of users ("bandwagon effect"), motivating the producer to forgo product dating in more scenarios. The producer may also decline the use of dating under certain consumer distributions, even where social utility hinges on who consumes. For consumer distributions heavily skewed toward lower types, product dating may reduce the WTP of too many consumers, thereby decreasing overall profits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Product Updating</head><p>As described before, firms regularly introduce product versions of higher quality than their predecessors. A product upgrade certainly provides higher intrinsic benefits; however, the newer version also allows the consumer to distinguish herself from those using the prior generation. An upgrade thus offers considerable status utility, even in products with substantial intrinsic benefits. For example, consumers often queue up to purchase the newest version of an electronic durable, be it an iPad, iPhone, or Nintendo Wii. Such a product update may entail the use of newer technologies, ingredients, or both.</p><p>In the context of fashion apparel, for example, many denim brands have updated their products with the incorporation of Lycra ® , popularly known as spandex. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> This synthetic fiber provides a better stretch to the garment, enhancing overall comfort. Although largely invisible, consumers may indirectly detect its presence through the distinctive shape of the garment. Brands have capitalized on both the intrinsic value and status value of Lycra via cobranding promotions with the spandex manufacturer Invista, as well as prominently displaying its use in product descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kotler and Pfoertsch 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the following analysis, we assume that the producer introduces an upgraded version, contingent upon a fixed cost investment in its manufacturing processes.

Because these two versions constitute separate products, an individual may determine the specific generation possessed by any given consumer. With two generations ultimately available, five consumption patterns may transpire: (1) buy the first generation in period 1 and update in period 2, (2) purchase the first version in period 1 and do not update, (3) buy the newer generation in period 2, (4) buy the first release in period 2, or (5) do not purchase. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Each consumer, under such a scenario, faces the optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">max x i 1Q x i 2Q x i 2Q n x i 1Q x i 2Q n U i 1Q − i Q+ 1+ 1Q 2 + U i 2Q n + 1−x i 1Q x i 2Q n 1− 1Q 2 + U i 2Q n +x i 2Q 1− 1Q 2 + U i 2Q + 1−x i 2Q −x i 2Q n • 1− 1Q 2 + 2Q 2 (9a) s.t. x i 1Q +x i 2Q ≤ 1 (9b) s.t. x i 2Q +x i 2Q n ≤ 1 (9c)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">U i 1Q = i Q + 1 + 1Q 2 − P 1Q (<label>10a</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">U i 2Q = i Q + 2Q n + 2Q 2 − P 2Q (<label>10b</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">U i 2Q n = i Q n + 1 + 2Q n 2 − P 2Q n (10c)</formula><p>Here, Q denotes the quality level of the original version, and Q n represents that of the updated product; and x i tQ indicates consumer i 's decision to purchase product version Q in period t.

Analysis. Solving for an SPNE, we determine the range of fixed costs at which the firm invests in product updating. We present this optimization solution in Appendix B.</p><p>Effect of New Product Quality and Status Sensitivity on Product Updating. Per Proposition 3(b), product dating yields a smaller marginal benefit for superior quality products. The marginal payoff of a product update, however, depends on the intrinsic value of both product generations. When offering a more substantial quality improvement, the producer may attain better market segmentation. After all, a greater quality improvement exacerbates differences in WTP, where the highest types experience the largest increases in WTP. The monopolist can target the update to these highest types, thereby extracting a substantial premium for the newer version. This premium, however, does not decrease total market demand since the firm concurrently offers the older product at a lower price. Accordingly, the profitability of an updating strategy increases as the newer version's quality improves.</p><p>Where a firm creates an upgrade of higher quality, early adopters more easily separate themselves from lower types. Creating a sense of exclusivity around the upgrade, an increase in product quality also indirectly boosts WTP via status utility. The indirect impact on status utility, however, is subject to the level of status sensitivity. Where social effects exert greater influence, a consumer possesses more incentive to associate with early adopters. In equilibrium, a wider range of consumer types purchase when status sensitivity is greater; hence, higher diminishes the extent to which a quality improvement creates exclusivity. The marginal return on quality improvement thus declines as consumers' sensitivity to social effects increases.</p><p>These intuitions are formally captured in the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 4. (a) A manufacturer is willing to incur greater investment cost for a more substantial quality improvement, and (b) the marginal benefit of quality improvement decreases with status sensitivity.</p><p>Part (a) of Proposition 4 may seem somewhat obvious, but this result may not apply in certain contexts outside the scope of our paper. A substantial quality improvement will yield marginal returns if consumers minimally value intrinsic quality. Furthermore, for a consumer population that is both sufficiently homogeneous and patient, potential early buyers may simply delay purchase until a newer version is available. If these consumers do not upgrade but rather "leapfrog" to the new version, a substantial investment in quality improvement may not generate adequate profit. Finally, for a quality upgrade to affect status utility, consumers must be able to differentiate the new and prior versions; otherwise, a quality upgrade only affects intrinsic utility and may provide modest returns. 17</p></div>

Where these other characteristics determine social status, a producer is less able to induce exclusivity through product consumption. As an extreme example, consider the explosion of grunge music into mainstream America in the early 1990s. Based in the Pacific Northwest, grunge bands typically sported flannel and wool button-downs as a means of "utilitarian necessity" <ref type="bibr">(Steele 2010, p. 380)</ref>.

This anecdote aside, unorthodox and counterculture tastes have largely blended with the conventional, as evidenced by the emergence of the "bourgeois bohemian" <ref type="bibr">(Brooks 2000, p. 11)</ref>. Integrating the "artistic rebelliousness of the bohemian beatnik" with the "worldly ambitions" of her "bourgeois corporate forefathers," the bourgeois bohemian seeks upward social mobility without, as Toby Miller, a professor of popular culture at New York University, says, "too obviously looking down on those below" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wittstock 2000)</ref>. She furnishes her home with "distressed Third World antiques," particularly those that help "distant cultures" through her consumerism <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wittstock 2000)</ref>. Her social status depends on attributes such as political awareness; however, she chooses pricier creations to convey these other attributes, implying the coinciding importance of wealth. As a similar example, note the image of Harley-Davidson-an owner requires high WTP to afford an expensive bike but also seeks an association with an "anti-yuppie" attitude <ref type="bibr">(Schouten and McAlexander 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Most commonly, social status depends on WTP in conjunction with other, possibly independent, attributes. Accordingly, we allow status to imperfectly correlate with WTP so as to establish the robustness of our findings. Let i ∼ U 0 1 denote a vertical differentiation measure that scales quality preference; as a reflection of income, i correlates with individuals i's social status. However, unlike the baseline scenario, status also depends on a second dimension independent of i . We formally denote z i ∼ U 0 1 such that z i i ∼ U 0 1 ∀ i. It is plausible that an individual may exert social influence despite moderate or lower wealth. For instance, a person's expertise in a domain may render her opinions persuasive, or her linguistic cues may convey status <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fiske 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Accounting for this second dimension z i , let the social status of person i equal y i = i + 1 − z i ; here, ∈ 0 1 indicates the correlation of social status and quality preference.

We formally determine social utility in Appendix B but discuss key insights below.</p><p>As before, the producer develops a decreasing price sequence for segmentation purposes. The efficacy of this strategic tool, however, is lessened as decreases because the producer cannot employ pricing to segment on dimensions such as consumer expertise. Where the producer is less able to create exclusivity via pricing effects, product consumption weakly correlates with high social status. The consumer does not enjoy a sense of exclusivity in this instance, implying lower status utility. Accordingly, status sensitivity has a smaller marginal effect as decreases. When = 0, wealth is entirely irrelevant to status, implying that product consumption provides no useful suggestion of social capital. In this scenario, status sensitivity does not factor into a person's purchase decision since individuals attain no social payoff through product use.</p><p>Status sensitivity only affects price depreciation to the extent that consumption separates individuals according to social status. That is, as decreases, status sensitivity produces a smaller effect on price depreciation; when = 0, it has no impact on price depreciation. This insight is formalized below.</p><p>Proposition 5. When WTP weakly influences social status, sensitivity to social effects ( ) exerts a weaker effect on price depreciation; when WTP does not influence status, does not affect depreciation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Heterogeneity in WTP for Status Utility</head><p>Although the baseline model acknowledges heterogeneity in quality preference, it assumes that every Marketing Science 32(5), pp. 786-804, © 2013 INFORMS consumer assigns the same value to social benefits. In many contexts, however, we may expect that individuals vary in this regard, implying that some will pay more for status utility. Indeed, this type of heterogeneity manifests through benefit segmentation in conspicuous product categories. The Samsung Galaxy S3 may lack Apple's highly identifiable branding, but its lighter weight and faster network speed have earned Samsung significant market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jaroslovsky 2012)</ref>. Apple retains a devoted consumer base, nevertheless, in part because of its designs of attractive, recognizable items <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Saba 2012)</ref>. Although Apple provides relatively high-quality products, we also note starker examples in which some consumers prioritize social benefits. For instance, "purse parties" allow women to examine and purchase cheap counterfeits of luxury brands such as Prada and Gucci <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gosline 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To reflect that consumers do not equally regard status, we present an extension where status sensitivity is allowed to vary across individuals. This creates a joint distribution between status sensitivity and WTP for quality, allowing us to generalize our model. We introduce w i , a scaling factor that determines i's WTP for a product's social benefit. A second-period buyer derives lifetime status utility w i</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">1 0 1 0 x i 1 + x i 2 dw i d i / 1 0 1 0 dw i d i</formula><p>at the time of purchase, where x i t = 1 if i buys in period t. The status benefit for early buyers and nonusers can be similarly derived, and both are formally presented in Appendix B.</p><p>Individual i still optimizes her intertemporal utility according to the timing decisions of all other consumers. Every individual's choice, however, is now contingent on her value of w i , implying that the relationship between i and w i affects demand. This relationship can materialize as one of many possible joint distributions. For computational ease, however, we assume that w i = 1 2 + i − 1 2 , where ∈ −1 1 ; i is still uniformly distributed across a unit interval,</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">w i ∼ U 1 2 − 1 2 1 2 + 1 2 .</formula><p>We note that under this assumption, Corr i w i =</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">1 0 i − 1 2 2 d i / 1 0 i − 1 2 2 d i 1 0 2 i − 1 2 2 d i = / 2</formula><p>. Thus, when is strictly greater (less) than 0, a perfect positive (inverse) relationship exists between i and w i . The set of buyers each period hence remains one-dimensional, allowing a tractable formulation of status utility. That said, Cov i w i = 1 0 i − 1 2 2 d i = /12, indicating that affects the degree to which i and w i differ in absolute terms. This implies that a change in affects the degree to which WTP varies across the population, meaning that determines which individuals buy each period and whether Proposition 1 holds.</p><p>To illustrate how affects the relationship between i and w i , consider two extreme examples. First, w i → i as → 1, meaning that those with higher social rank (i.e., high i ) care more about social considerations (i.e., high w i ). Although fairly plausible, this scenario exacerbates differences in WTP across consumers. We thus expect that price depreciation increases with status sensitivity when → 1, much like our baseline model. At the opposite extreme, w i → 1 − i when → −1. This might occur if a high type (i.e., high i ) weakly desires to flaunt said social position, whereas an individual with poorer status (i.e., low i ) feels pressured to acquire status items.</p><p>A negative provides us with a conservative test of our result since it lessens (increases) the total WTP of individuals with high (low) values of i .</p><p>Whenever 2Q &gt; &gt; 0, / P * 2 P * 1 /P * 1 &lt; 0 ∀ ∈ −1 1 and / P * 2 P * 1 /P * 1 =−1 = 0 (see Appendix B for formal exposition). Although Proposition 1 does not hold when = −1, this is the most conservative test where both i ∼ U 0 1 and w i ∼ U 0 1 . The ratio P * 2 P * 1 /P * 1 should decrease with anytime that Corr i w i ∈ −1 1 since early adopters will skew more toward higher types than when = Corr i w i = −1. For sufficiently negative and &gt; 2Q, however, a higher i may not always imply an earlier purchase date. Our result may become invalid under such circumstances. 18</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>In this paper, we explore marketplace outcomes in conspicuous product categories, employing a consumer preference model that acknowledges the extant literature. Conspicuousness requires a degree of exclusivity in that the product user desires consumption unattainable for those with less status. To recognize this role of product exclusivity, we allow each individual's purchase timing preferences to depend on the product adoption decisions of all other consumers. The consuming item provides exclusivity to the extent that only high status individuals acquire. This benefit of exclusivity increases in importance where individuals particularly care about social payoffs; accordingly, we permit consumers' status sensitivity to figure into a prospective buyer's decision-making process. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Analysis quickly becomes intractable whenever the set of buyers becomes two-dimensional, even if i and w i are independent. In an online appendix, available at http://dx.doi.org/10 .1287/mksc.2013.0797, we examine a scenario in which i w i ∈ ¯ × w w , leading to four distinct consumer segments. Cumbersome analyses yield a picture in which different parameter combinations produce different results. In particular, there could exist some cases in which the severity of price depreciation is lessened by an increase in visibility. This suggests that certain consumer distributions may generate different insights. We, however, leave this for future research because our study provides a first step in this area.</p><p>Allowing exclusivity to emerge as a consequence of both product quality and status sensitivity, we achieve an endogenous determination of early adopters and market followers. In essence, our model captures ingroup formation, in that each consumer's purchase timing decision hinges on the choices of all other individuals. This allows us to show that high intrinsic quality indirectly causes exclusivity by way of pricing effects. This indirect effect becomes important when consumers highly value social effects, particularly in that it causes rapid price depreciation.</p><p>In addition, we considered two product management strategies that allow early adopters to maintain exclusivity and its associated status benefits. The first method, product dating, sustains separation of types through minor style modifications, such as those employed through the use of fashion diffusion lines. Product updating, on the other hand, entails a functional improvement in product quality, indirectly affecting social benefits. Because these two strategies differ in nature, they encompass distinctive costs and yield unequal returns in revenue. Hence, we expect each to be more appropriate under certain conditions. Although an explicit analysis is beyond the scope of our paper, Propositions 3 and 4 help explicate this issue. We predict product dating to generate superior returns wherever consumption is more social and/or intrinsic quality is relatively unimportant. Conversely, when intrinsic benefits more heavily influence purchase timing, we anticipate product updating to be optimal. This pattern may help explain (1) the emphasis on designers, label, and logos in the apparel industry and (2) the greater focus on engineering, technology, and product development in automobiles and electronic gadgets.</p><p>From a public policy perspective, our model allows us to calculate both consumer welfare and the effect of product management strategies on welfare. Such analyses can help clarify public policy concerns surrounding conspicuous consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Charles et al. 2009</ref>). Our calculations determine that greater status sensitivity typically implies higher overall welfare but that product management strategies may potentially harm consumers. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> In the present article, we have considered a monopoly to illustrate the combined effect of consumption utility and status utility; however, conspicuous product markets are, in many cases, characterized by differentiated competition. Future research may accordingly consider multiple sellers, determining how competition has an impact on status utility and, ultimately, market pricing outcomes. A future model can also account for marketing variables beyond price and product quality; for instance, where branding influences status sensitivity, our model may help compare the return on investment of branding to that of product development. Finally, future studies may consider alternative formulations of status utility and empirically test each formulation. For example, an alternative specification can allow positive (negative) social utility when above (below)-average individuals consume a product. Such a formulation can also incorporate different sensitivity parameters, depending on whether the product induces a gain or loss relative to expectations. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> </p></div>

However, in t = 2, consumers no longer benefit from any alternative purchase occasion; accordingly, the producer sets P 1 2 P 1 = 2P 1 + kQ 2 /4 to maximize profits among all remaining consumers.

We thank an anonymous reviewer for help in refining this argument.12  The findings of<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pesendorfer (1995)</ref> imply that use of branding and logos primarily determine purchase behavior in conspicuous consumption markets.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="15">Analysis becomes quickly complicated because many parameter regions allow for a variety of consumption patterns. To focus on the issues at hand, we consider an interior solution that guarantees consumption patterns 1, 3, 4, and 5.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="16">We obtain similar results by modeling quality improvement as a consequence of a marginal cost increase. However, our fixed cost approach is more faithful to Moore's law; furthermore, new product generations require plant and machinery upgrades, particularly in consumer electronics industries. Finally, this formulation provides a ready comparison to our product dating analysis.</note>
