<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Marketers have become very keen on leveraging social influence among customers. Social contagion in new product adoption, the phenomenon that adopting a new product is affected by the extent to which peers are already using it, is a form of influence that has received much attention lately. The conditions are ready for the research frontier to move from investigating whether contagion is at work to why it occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aral 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Godes 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">, Peres et al. 2010</ref>. Understanding how social status affects the sources' influence or contagiousness and the recipients' susceptibility to such influence provides deeper insight into the mechanisms through which contagion operates (Van den Bulte 2010, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004)</ref>. It also improves the ability to identify customers likely to adopt early and to influence others into adopting <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Iyengar et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Yet, status motivations have not been studied much in diffusion research <ref type="bibr">(Rogers 2003, p. 231)</ref>. Theory and research in marketing on how status in general and status as an esteemed source of information and influence in particular relate to adoption behavior has so far considered only monotonic effects: the higher the status, the sooner one adopts, the more one influences others, and the less susceptible one is to others' influence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Iyengar et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We introduce the notion that, for innovations that have the potential to boost one's social status, people's current status affects both the tendency to adopt and the susceptibility to contagion in a nonmonotonic fashion: more so for middle-status than for low status and high status. We develop this notion from classic insights in social psychology and sociology about middle-status anxiety and conformity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Homans 1961</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Mills 1951</ref>). These concepts have gained renewed appreciation in the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(de Botton 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Marwick 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Phillips and Zuckerman 2001</ref> but have not been related to how status moderates the susceptibility to social contagion in the adoption of new products. In addition to nonmonotonic effects on the propensity to adopt early and the susceptibility to social contagion, we also study Marketing Science 33(4), pp. 509-533, © 2014 INFORMS how status and use experience affects the within-tie influence or contagiousness of prior adopters, an issue of debate in recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Godes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mayzlin 2009, Iyengar et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>We investigate these questions in the context of commercial kits used in genetic engineering. This research setting offers important methodological benefits. First, social status is quite important to scientists (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cole and Cole 1973, pp. 45-46)</ref> and is likely to matter considerably in the adoption of the new product we study because it offered the potential for greater research productivity and impact-the gateway to higher scientific status-but was not considered quite legitimate at first <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Davies and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pugsley 1990, Jordan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lynch 1998)</ref>. Second, the research setting provides us with not one but two metrics of social status that vary over time and are measured quite precisely: centrality in the network of coauthorship ties and citation counts.</p><p>We study the adoption dynamics using an individuallevel hazard model implemented within a nested case-control design. The latter avoids the need to construct covariates for the entire population of potential adopters while at the same time avoiding truncation biases (Van den Bulte and Iyengar 2011) and achieving statistical efficiency.</p><p>We find evidence that status affects (i) how early one adopts regardless of social influence, (ii) how susceptible one is to social influence, and (iii) how influential one's own behavior is in triggering adoption by others. Inverse-U patterns in (i) and (ii) are consistent with middle-status anxiety and conformity. Hence, the three effects go beyond the notions that individuals are influential or influenceable merely because they are social hubs connected to many others.</p><p>Our work extends current insights on status and new product adoption in four ways. First, we propose and document that it is not high-status but middlestatus individuals who are most likely to adopt early, at least for innovations that have the potential to boost status. Second, we propose and document that for such innovations it is not low-status but middle-status individuals who are most susceptible to contagion. Third, we show that high-status adopters are more influential or "contagious" not simply because they are connected to more people but also because they exert more influence within each of their ties. Finally, our evidence not only documents the importance of both the status and experience of prior adopters in driving social contagion, but also suggests that these two characteristics operate through different mechanisms.</p><p>These findings provide new insights into why contagion takes place. They may also help to improve targeting decisions when launching new products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Status Defined and Contrasted</head><p>Status is a position within a social structure in which individuals are evaluated based on social esteem and respect <ref type="bibr">(Turner 1988, p. 5</ref>). Status can be thought of as prestige, and many authors have at times used the two terms as synonyms (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gardner and Moore 1950, p. 22;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goode 1978, p. 4;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hagstrom 1965, pp. 84, 168, and 192;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leahey 2004, p. 523;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott 1996, p. 100)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Shils (1968)</ref> does so as well (p. 120) but prefers the term "deference-position" to convey more emphatically that "status is not a substantial property of the person but is in fact an element in a relationship between the person deferred to and the deferent person. Deference towards another person is an attitude which is manifested in behaviour" (p. 116). <ref type="bibr">Podolny and Lynn (2009, pp. 547-548)</ref> similarly define status in terms of being the recipient of "accumulated acts of deference." Consistently with Shils's emphasis that status is relational and manifested in behavior, they note that the deference on which status is based is "something awarded by others." In short, status has three defining elements: it is a position in a social structure based on esteem that is bestowed by others.</p><p>Next, we differentiate status from power, class, reputation, and ability (including expertise). We also note that metrics of network centrality can be used to measure status, provided that the ties in the network capture a relationship of esteem.</p><p>Status, based on differences in esteem, is related to yet distinct from power, the ability to influence others. Status is a source of power, and perceived influence can be a source of status. Yet, the concepts are distinct, and each has many other causes and consequences <ref type="bibr">(Berger et al. 1972, Ridgeway and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Correll 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Status and class are also related yet distinct. Both pertain to social stratification, but class is based on economic wealth, whereas status is based on esteem and respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Turner 1988</ref>). The two need not go hand-inhand, as illustrated by the contempt for nouveaux riches and the respect for impoverished intellectuals, nobility, and monks, and as documented by the variation of status within economic classes <ref type="bibr">(Cole and Cole 1973, p. 45;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lamont 1992</ref>) and the rather weak association between occupational status and income <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chan and Goldthorpe 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Status and reputation are related yet distinct as well (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Podolny 2005)</ref>. First, the notion of relative rank ordering is essential to status but not reputation. Whereas status pertains by definition to relative vertical differentiation, reputation may also pertain to absolute quality level or to relative horizontal differentiation. Second, people's or products' reputations are based on their prior performance, whereas status can stem not only from perceived competence or performance but also from unearned ascription based on gender, ethnic, racial, or other group membership (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gould 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, Rossman et al. 2010</ref>.</p><p>Status is also distinct from ability and its various facets like expertise (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Zhou 1991, Sauder et al. 2012</ref>). Hence, using labels like "informational status" to refer to the "amount of skill or knowledge possessed" obfuscates rather than illuminates, as <ref type="bibr">Runciman (1968, p. 33)</ref> notes. First, status is based on the esteem bestowed by others, whereas ability is intrinsic rather than relational. Second, the esteem is manifested in others' behavior whereas ability need not be. Finally, even though local esteem may be driven by a perception of competence among immediate colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Owen-Smith 2001)</ref>, "the link between status and expertise is tenuous" in general, as <ref type="bibr">Leahey notes (2004, p. 533)</ref>. Students of science, for instance, have long noted that scientific talent is only one of many factors that tend to produce status differentiation <ref type="bibr">(Cole and Cole 1973, p. 68</ref>). One reason is that ability is only one of many determinants of research performance, with other important factors being luck, perseverance, and resources like the right laboratory equipment and cell tissues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Latour and Woolgar 1986)</ref>. Another reason is that performance (volume and quality of research achievements) does not map perfectly into status, even though the scientific ethos tries to make that link as strong as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Azoulay et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Leahey 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Merton 1968</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Finally, the relation between status and network centrality merits consideration. The former is based on social esteem and respect, i.e., some form of public valuation, whereas the latter pertains to a position of importance in a network. Though network centrality is often used to measure status <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Sauder et al. 2012)</ref>, metrics of network centrality are valid measures of status only if the ties in the network capture a relationship of esteem and respect. So, centrality in networks of purely transactional buy/sell ties with little to no trust-the attribution of ability, honesty, or benevolence-does not capture status. But it does in networks of collaboration among scientists or investment banks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Podolny 2005)</ref> or in networks of patient referral or advice seeking among physicians (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Iyengar et al. 2011, Menchik and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Meltzer 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Middle-Status Anxiety and Middle-Status Conformity</head><p>The current insights on the role of status in new product adoption and contagion involve monotonic effects. In contrast, we advance the notion that the people most likely to adopt an innovation early and most likely to be susceptible to social contagion are those in the middle strata of social status. The argument involves a double premise and two claims:</p><p>Premise. Middle-status individuals (i) are more concerned about their status than others are ("middle-status anxiety") and (ii) have a higher tendency to conform to social-normative influence ("middle-status conformity").</p><p>Claim 1. For a product that is expected to help maintain or increase status, middle-status individuals have the highest propensity to adopt early.</p><p>Claim 2. For a product that is expected to help maintain or increase status but is also subject to social-normative contagion, middle-status individuals have the highest susceptibility to social contagion.</p><p>Claim 1 posits an inverse-U relation between status and adoption propensity, whereas Claim 2 posits such a relation between status and susceptibility to contagion. Both claims pertain to social status purely, under the usual ceteris paribus condition making abstraction of differences in wealth, ability, and other factors that may be correlated with status and may enable the adoption of new products and technologies. We now present the argument in greater detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Middle-Status Anxiety and the</head><p>Propensity to Adopt Early Status anxiety is the concern induced by the uncertainty about how much others esteem us now and will do so in the future (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gardner and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moore 1950, Homans 1962</ref>). This anxiety is most pronounced in settings where status matters considerably and the status ordering is ambiguous, unstable, or in flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gould 2003)</ref>. Social theory posits that status anxiety is typically the highest among middle-status individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(de Botton 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Mills 1951</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">, Newman 1999</ref>. One likely reason is fluidity: they experience both a threat to lose and an opportunity to gain status. Low-status and high-status individuals, in contrast, experience only one of those sources of potential flux in their position. Another likely reason is ambiguity: making a rank assessment between oneself and another is less straightforward for individuals located in the middle of the distribution. The third likely reason is the goal gradient: the nearer one is to the goal, the harder one works to achieve it <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Harvey and</ref><ref type="bibr">Consalvi 1960, Kivetz et al. 2006</ref>). Hence, assuming that high status is a goal, middle-status individuals will work harder to maintain and improve their ranking than low-status individuals who are further away from the goal or prize. They will also strive harder to maintain or improve their status than high-status individuals who not only already have achieved the desired state (so the goal gradient is zero) but also typically feel most secure in their standing. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Marketing Science 33(4), pp. 509-533, © 2014 INFORMS Middle-status anxiety provides an explanation for the commonly accepted notion that consumers' concern to "keep up with the Joneses" and maintain status through consumption is most pronounced among upwardly or downwardly mobile middle-class consumers who live in market-based societies that experience important social changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(de Botton 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Marwick 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Mills 1951</ref>.</p><p>Middle-status anxiety implies Claim 1: middle-status individuals are the keenest to quickly adopt a product that is expected to help maintain or increase status. Apart from some suggestive evidence in an early study of new drug adoption by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Menzel (1957)</ref>, we are not aware of empirical support for that claim. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Phillips and Zuckerman (2001)</ref> find evidence of a U rather than an inverse-U relation between status and propensity to adopt early. Though the pattern is the reverse, it is consistent with middle-status anxiety because they studied the adoption of an innovation likely to harm rather than boost status. Similarly, outside the realm of innovation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Yim (2012)</ref> finds that middle-status departments are the least likely to hire their own Ph.D. graduates as faculty, a form of academic inbreeding typically frowned upon. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Middle-Status Conformity and the</head><p>Susceptibility to Contagion The middle-status conformity hypothesis is an equally venerable insight from sociology and social psychology. The logic consists of relating middle-status anxiety to the tendency to conform to others' opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dittes and Kelley 1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Harvey and Consalvi 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Homans 1961</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">, Phillips and Zuckerman 2001</ref>. Status is the outcome of others' perception of an individual and leads to particular expectations regarding his or her behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hollander 1958)</ref>. Of particular note is that higher status permits "greater latitude in the manifestation of behaviors which would be seen to be nonconformist for the other [lower-status] members of the group" <ref type="bibr">(Hollander 1958, p. 120)</ref>. In short, as long as the transgression is not tantamount to betraying the core interests of the group, of performance. For recent evidence of very low turnover at the very top end of the hierarchy of fame, a concept distinct from but related to status, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">van de Rijt et al. (2013)</ref>. All these findings are consistent with, though do not directly document, a flatter goal gradient in status attainment at the very high end of the status distribution: since attaining high status is harder than maintaining it, one would expect middle-status people to exert more effort than high-status people. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> More puzzlingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jensen (2010)</ref> finds that Danish middle-status actors were more likely than low-and high-status actors to feature in potentially illegitimate movies combining comedy with pornography in the 1970s. However, some features of the research setting make it less than ideal to study status effects: (i) these sex comedies were attempts to appeal to a large public, making low-status actors less likely to be selected by producers, and (ii) high-status actors likely had commercially less risky projects open to them. the degree to which an individual may deviate from the common normative expectancies of the group is greater for high-status individuals, as documented in several studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alvarez 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Blau 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Erickson and Nosanchuk 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Hollander 1958</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Kelley and Shapiro 1954</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Leahey 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">, Phillips et al. 2013</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hollander (1958)</ref> adds the important qualifier that the degree to which the individual is visible may also alter the effects of not conforming. As documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dittes and Kelley (1956)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Menzel (1960)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Harvey and Consalvi (1960)</ref>, being a marginal, barely visible member of the group can negatively affect one's motivation to conform to the group or community.</p><p>Combining both considerations, how status enhances the motivation to conform as well as the latitude to deviate with impunity, suggests an inverse-U relation. As <ref type="bibr">Harvey and Consalvi (1960, pp. 182-183)</ref> proposed, " the very remoteness of the lowest status man from the top position might result in his being less motivated to move up the status ladder and consequently less sensitive to group pressures The second ranking person could prove to be the member on whom the goal of the top position exercises greatest motivational pull The leader's behavior should be less affected by striving for the top position than that of either of the other two status members by virtue of having attained that goal. If his position is secure, the leader can perhaps afford to deviate further from the behavior of the other members."</p><p>In short, the middle-status conformity argument is that lower-status individuals see relatively little upside from conforming and no downside from not conforming; high-status individuals see little upside from conforming and, when the position is secure, little downside from not conforming, with the results that it is individuals of middle-status who are most prone to conform.</p><p>Applied to new product diffusion, middle-status conformity implies Claim 2: for a product that is expected to help maintain or improve status but is also subject to social-normative contagion, middle-status individuals will have the highest susceptibility to social contagion. We are not aware of any prior empirical support for that claim.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Scope Conditions</head><p>The nonmonotonic patterns predicted based on middlestatus anxiety and conformity are not part of standard diffusion theory. So, it is important to delineate scope conditions under which the middle-status logic applies and the nonmonotonic patterns are expected to hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Phillips and Zuckerman 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The first condition is that conformity to social norms is indeed a concern motivating one not to adopt immediately and leading the adoption decision to be susceptible to social contagion. This will be the case whenever the innovation is not fully legitimate, adoption is visible, and potential adopters care about legitimacy. The second condition is that the innovation is sufficiently attractive to justify adoption if legitimacy were not a concern.</p><p>The third condition is that middle-status individuals are more motivated than low-status individuals to adopt early and to conform to others' adoptions. Goal-gradient theory implies that the condition is met when status is a goal and people expect that adoption will increase their status, setting aside legitimacy considerations. The fourth condition is that middlestatus individuals are more motivated than high-status individuals to adopt early and to conform to others' adoptions. This condition will be met whenever highstatus people feel sufficiently secure in their position, for instance because of Matthew effects providing protection at the high end of the status spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Merton 1968)</ref> or because nonconformity by high-status individuals in fact enhances their status <ref type="bibr">(Bellezza et al. 2014, Berkowitz and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Macaulay 1961)</ref>.</p><p>A fifth condition is that there is a single dominant reference group for everyone, so there is agreement on both legitimacy and status ordering. This condition precludes the existence of subcommunities or subcultures each having their own norms of legitimacy and their own assessment of the esteem to be bestowed on various individuals <ref type="bibr">Heath 2008, Üstüner and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Holt 2010)</ref>. Of course, middle-status conformity may still operate within subcultures.</p><p>Besides these theoretical scope conditions, there is also a methodological condition that must be met in empirical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Phillips and Zuckerman 2001)</ref>: the effects of status must be assessed while controlling, either through the research design or statistically, for the effect of other relevant stratifying variables, like economic resources, access to information, and ability. Separating status effects pertaining to motivation from other effects pertaining to opportunity or ability is a challenge that has plagued several studies investigating nonmonotonic status effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cancian 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cancian , 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Faris and Felmlee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Han 1994</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Setting</head><p>We study the adoption by life scientists of commercial kits to perform site-directed mutagenesis (SDM), a form of genetic engineering. Given the importance of the institutional setting for proper theoretical inference in status and diffusion research (e.g., Phillips and Zuckerman 2001, Van den Bulte and Lilien 2001), we discuss how our research setting allows for an informative assessment of the middle-status anxiety and conformity hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Fit to the Theoretical Scope Conditions</head><p>Like all scientists, SDM researchers seek to improve their peers' esteem of them and their work. Status is gained mostly through research achievements <ref type="bibr">(Hagstrom 1965, Latour and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Woolgar 1986)</ref>, and there are no subcultures in which people can easily alter status orderings by redefining what constitutes good taste or good research. Achievements are reflected in commonly verifiable publications in prestigious journals, and status is publicly visible through citation counts and honorific awards (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cole and Cole 1973, pp. 46-60)</ref>. SDM kits hold the promise of enabling their adopters to successfully complete their research in less time, which is important in fast-cycle biomedical research to improve one's status <ref type="bibr">(Fujimura 1996, Jordan and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lynch 1992)</ref>. Initially, however, SDM kits were considered somewhat illegitimate by many <ref type="bibr">(Hengen 1994, Weiner and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Slatko 2008)</ref>, and their adoption was quite visible to collaborators, colleagues, and any reader of one's working papers and publications.

That middle-status scientists would care more about their status than low-status scientists is quite consistent with the general goal-gradient principle, whereas Matthew effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allison et al. 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Merton 1968</ref>) provide security to scientists with the highest status. The Web appendix (available as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2014.0857) provides additional background information on the relevance of status in science and on SDM kits, including concerns about their legitimacy.</p></div>

The existence and characteristics of these kits was common knowledge across all status levels. Their main benefits are convenience and reproducibility, and do not vary across status levels. Hence, there is no systematic relation between scientists' status and their ability to use or benefit from the kits. The same holds for status and economic resources. Using kits involves a greater cash expenditure than buying the components separately and following publicly available protocols. However, kits reduce the amount of training and trial-and-error tinkering necessary to run a procedure, and provide reliably high yields. Also, maintaining quality control of the reagents, matching components, labeling, and finding detailed manuals and solutions to unexpected problems all require time and labor, which, many feel, outweighs the difference in purchase costs between using kits and fully "do it yourself" mutagenesis. Through all these cost reductions, kits increase the number of experiments that can be done with a given budget. Unless their lab is extremely cash constrained, the appeal of commercial kits is unrelated to scientists' economic resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Methods and Data</head><p>We study the adoption of commercial SDM kits by life scientists from 1988 when the first kits appeared on the market until 1997 by which time they had become rather commonplace. We define the population at risk as academic scientists who use SDM in their research. We identify them using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) compiled by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and maintained by the National Institutes of Health. This bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information covers approximately 5,000 journals and other publications pertaining to health and biomedicine, including biology and biochemistry. We identify each scientist with at least two publications using SDM between 1988 and 1996 as a potential adopter of SDM kits. We identified 24,310 scientific and technical papers involving SDM authored by 8,259 academic scientists meeting this criterion. Thus, the "population at risk" of potential adopters is N = 8,259. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The number of people publishing their first paper within our window grew over time as the field developed. The cohort sizes from 1988 to 1996 are <ref type="bibr">305, 332, 429, 763, 985, 1,063, 1,898, 1,278, and 1,206.</ref> The growth is quite steady, except for a bump in 1994, the year after Michael Smith received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing SDM.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> reports the cumulative adoption rates by cohort. The 10-year rate of the 1988 cohort is 40% and the nine-year rate of the 1989 cohort is 32%. The adoption is still increasing in all cohorts in 1997. Though the average penetration at the end of the observation window is only 12.5%, this stems from the presence of large cohorts observed for only a short time span, rather than from the new product having fizzled out or from only a small subset of scientists being at risk of ever adopting.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.</formula><p>We analyze how status and contagion affect the time of adoption using hazard modeling. Since we observe all of the life scientists who have used SDM in their publications, we know the entire population of potential adopters. Adoption in our study means being involved in a publication, typically coauthored, using a commercial SDM kit rather than simply purchasing such a kit. Contributing to such a publication implies that one agrees with the use of such a kit in a research report visible to other biomedical researchers and on which one's name appears, so status considerations should be at work. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The author data recorded in scientific publications allows us to construct a rich set of covariates without facing unit nonresponse problems common to survey research.</p><p>Since we include a large set of covariates, many of which vary over time, and since the population at <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Status effects might be easier to detect in adoption processes where the individual is solely responsible for adoption rather than only as part of a small collective. Though we observe adoption through publications, the great majority of which are coauthored, it is appropriate to use individual researchers and not the laboratory they work in as the unit of analysis. Research teams in molecular biology are only of moderate size and nothing like the sometimes massive teams in high energy physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Knorr Cetina 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Newman 2001</ref>. The median number of authors per paper in our data is four, and the 5%-95% range is one-nine, so every author is likely to be involved in the decision to use commercial kits or not. Also, confounding status with power effects is unlikely in our research context since even junior researchers like doctoral students and postdocs often have considerable freedom in defining the specific problems they pursue and choosing the modalities used in doing so (Knorr Cetina 1999, Latour and Woolgar 1986). risk counts more than 8,000 individuals, coding all variables for each and every potential adopter over time would be extremely demanding. It would require collecting and coding data on 28,001 scientist-year observations up to adoption. Limiting the analysis only to the 1,030 adopters would generate serious biases (Van den Bulte and Iyengar 2011). Using a stratified sample ensuring that the relative proportion of adopters and nonadopters in the data set corresponds to that in the population avoids those biases, but requires the deletion of many adopters and hence is statistically quite inefficient.</p><p>We resolve these competing considerations of coding effort, bias, and statistical efficiency through a nested case-control design. Widely used in epidemiology, this design controls for unmeasured confounders, improves the precision of the estimates, and does so with substantial savings in cost and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armenian 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Essebag et al. 2003</ref>. In our case, it requires fully coding 6,180 instead of 28,001 observations, a significant reduction since the data collection and coding effort still took about 6,000 man-hours. The core idea is to combine response-based sampling with an appropriate statistical model, adapted specifically to hazard modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Nested Case-Control Design</head><p>The design involves three main steps prior to estimation:</p><p>(1) defining and selecting cases (adopters), (2) defining the population at risk and the risk set of controls for each type or nest of adopter, and (3) randomly selecting controls from each risk set.</p><p>Step 1 consists of identifying the 1,030 cases using MEDLINE, as described previously.</p><p>Step 2 involves defining a risk set for each case, from which the controls are selected. We define, for each adopter, a risk set of controls consisting of all SDM scientists who still had not adopted at the time (calendar year) the focal adopter did. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In addition, we restrict each adopter's risk set to researchers who matched the adopter on two time-invariant characteristics. The first is the country where the scientist's institution is located (or the first institution listed in case of multiple affiliations). The second is whether the scientist is (i) a specialist in SDM who has published papers on SDM technology modifications or improvements, (ii) a molecular biologist, or (iii) other. As a result, each adopter is matched with a risk set of all other scientists with the same scientific profile and country of affiliation who had not adopted when the adopter did.</p><p>In step 3, we randomly select five controls from each adopter's risk set. A higher control-to-case ratio generates little gain in statistical efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Donkers et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gail et al. 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">, Ury 1975</ref>. As recommended in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Essebag et al. 2003)</ref>, we sample the controls randomly from the risk sets with the requirement that the controls do not adopt in the same year as the case. So, controls may include scientists who are not observed to adopt or who are observed to adopt later than the case does. Also, the selection within a given year is without replacement. As a result, it is possible for the same scientist to be a control for multiple cases (adopters), but only if these cases do not adopt in the same year.</p><p>We estimate a discrete-time Cox proportional odds model adjusted for the case-control design (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Breslow 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Langholz 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Lee and Wang 2003</ref>. This simply amounts to estimating across all case-control sets a conditional multinomial logit model for the probability that of each sextet consisting of a case adopting in a particular year and its five nonadopting controls, it is indeed the case who adopts. All effects that are common across the case and its controls are conditioned out. This includes the effect, even time varying, of variables used for matching and of variables that vary over time but not across individuals, like category-level legitimacy, advertising, price level, and product quality of the innovation.</p><p>An alternative is to estimate, across all members of the case-control sets, a traditional unconditional binary logit model for the hazard of adoption. Because the number of controls matched to each case remains constant over time, neither the conditional or unconditional case-control model generates the truncation biases documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Van den Bulte and Iyengar (2011)</ref>. As readers familiar with estimating logit models in choicebased samples may intuit, the unconditional model provides inconsistent estimates of the time-varying intercepts used to represent the Cox nonparametric baseline hazard (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Langholz 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">, Lee and Wang 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">, Prentice and Breslow 1978</ref>. More importantly, the unconditional model should include all of the matching variables as covariates, and allow them to moderate the effects of variables that vary over time but not across individuals. The conditional model is clearly more efficient to control for sources of variation that are not of substantive interest. The appendix presents the likelihood functions for the full-population hazard model and for the conditional case-control models with and without matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Status Measures</head><p>We use two time-varying measures of status. The first is the degree centrality in the network of scientific Marketing Science 33(4), pp. 509-533, © 2014 INFORMS collaboration involving SDM. In directed networks involving deference or appreciation like advice seeking or favor seeking, the number of incoming ties or indegree centrality is a popular measure of status (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Knoke and Burt 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Lu et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Menchik and Meltzer 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prell 2012, p. 99;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Sauder et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Sgourev 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wasserman and Faust 1994, p. 202)</ref>. In undirected networks consisting of ties requiring both parties to mutually approve of one another, like collaboration among scientists or alliances among firms, degree is the same as in-degree and so reflects the extent to which one is esteemed by others, i.e., one's status (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Burt 2010, pp. 33-35;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Stuart et al. 1999</ref>). Another reason for using degree centrality as a measure of status in our study is that two graph-theoretic measures assuming that one's status is a function of the status of one's contacts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Katz's (1953)</ref> prestige measure and PageRank centrality without arbitrary additive constant, are both identical to degree centrality in networks with undirected ties <ref type="bibr">(Jackson 2008, pp. 40-41;</ref><ref type="bibr">Newman 2010, pp. 177-178)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We measure a scientist's degree in year t as the number of coauthors in year t − 1 on any of the 24,310 papers involving SDM we identified. Such archival data on "affiliation networks" where ties are based on joint involvement in activities or common membership in groups have three advantages over self-reported ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Goldenberg et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Newman 2001</ref>): (i) unit or item nonresponse is not a problem so complete data can be collected over large networks; (ii) the measurement is often more reliable than with selfreports; and (iii) affiliation data are often available longitudinally, so the network can be measured over multiple points in time rather than only once, typically retrospectively. Of course, all of these benefits pertaining to measurement are irrelevant unless the ties are substantively relevant for the phenomenon at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Trusov et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">, Van den Bulte 2010</ref>. Our data meet this requirement as well. Collaborating with other scientists and publishing the results jointly represents a very intensive type of communication <ref type="bibr">(Crane 1972, Stokes and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Hartley 1989</ref>). 9 Such intense interaction is 8 Some researchers have used eigenvector and Bonacich beta-centrality rather than degree centrality as graph-theoretic measures of status <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Sauder et al. 2012</ref>). These two measures, however, cannot be computed validly in networks consisting of multiple disconnected subgraphs or "components" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bonacich 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">, Poulin et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">, Wei et al. 2011</ref>. The collaboration networks we study feature multiple components. Computing eigenvector and Bonacich beta-centrality scores for each component separately is possible, but the scores are not comparable across components and hence cannot be used together as a single measure of status in a statistical analysis. Limiting the analysis to the largest component is not an attractive option either, since it accounts for only a small fraction of the overall network, e.g., less than 10% in 1996. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Extremely large research collaborations involving many coauthors may be an exception to this association between coauthorship and often necessary for transferring mastery of complex research techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Collins 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Kaiser 2005</ref> and is an important conduit for normative influence about what constitutes a proper research procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Latour and Woolgar 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Our research setting provides us with a second measure of status. Specifically, we use the natural logarithm of the (noncumulative) number of citations in year t − 1 to a scientist's work reported by the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, excluding self-citations, as the second measure of his or her status in year t. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Citations are meant to recognize that one's own work has been informed or otherwise influenced by the work one cites. Though some citations refer to papers that are being criticized rather than endorsed, and though some authors might use citations strategically to position their work within particular research traditions or to generate sympathy from peers who they believe may referee their work, these negative and strategic citations also are acts of recognition or even deference, and so do not detract from the validity of citation counts as a measure of status <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baldi 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cole and Cole 1973, p. 25)</ref>.

Even when used for persuasion, the fact that a specific reference is used rather than another reflects those references' relative status.</p><p>The number of citations scientists receive is a good indicator of the amount of recognition that their work has received and hence of their status (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cole and Cole 1973, pp. 99-106;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gaston 1978)</ref>. There are other, more formal types of recognition, including prestigious awards (e.g., Nobel and MacArthur), memberships in honorific societies (e.g., Royal Society), and appointments at prestigious university departments and institutes. However, these identify only the very elite. The attention one's research receives from the scientific community, as reflected in citations, provides a more fine-grained measure over the entire range of status. This may be why, according to some scholars, such attention operates as a greater incentive for scientists than formal recognition that only the most elite scholars receive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Waterman 1966)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows histograms for degree and citations in both the full scientist-year at-risk data (NT = 28,001) and the case-control data (N = 6,180).

We investigate three conduits: direct collaborative ties (coauthorship), being a member of the same department, and being a member of the same university or institute, all in the prior year.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Control Variables</head><p>We include several control variables besides the period, country, and specialty effects already accounted for through the nested case-control matching. The first set captures characteristics of the paper and the team of authors. The number of coauthors is self-explanatory. The indicator nonspecialist coauthor takes the value 1 if any of the coauthors is not an SDM specialist (who may therefore favor using a commercial SDM kit). The number of funding sources acknowledged in the paper is again self-explanatory.</p><p>The next set of control variables pertains to characteristics of the focal scientist. Past use of other kits is a dummy indicating whether the scientist had used kits for purposes other than SDM before year t, which likely reflects a positive attitude toward commercial kits. Number of SDM papers for purpose 1 or purpose 2 is the total number of papers published by the scientist in year t on either studying protein function (purpose 1) or producing final protein products (purpose 2). The sum of those two counts is the total number of SDM publications by scientist i in year t and so would be an obvious offset variable and could also be interpreted as a measure of research performance affecting one's reputation, but we distinguish between the two because kits are more appropriate for the first type of SDM application. Prior faculty adoption at Ph.D. institution is the number of faculty at a scientist's Ph.D.-granting institution who adopted SDM kits before the scientist graduated. The variable is time invariant, and is zero for anyone who received their Ph.D. before 1988. We control for academic age, operationalized as the number of years since the scientist earned his or her Ph.D., to avoid confounding status with mere work experience. We also include cohort dummies for the first year that the scientist published an SDM paper within our 10-year observation window. Including such nonparametric controls for birth cohort in a conditional logit case-control hazard model corresponds to including a flexible baseline hazard in a traditional hazard model (because age = period − cohort).</p><p>Finally, we also control for whether the institution that the scientist was affiliated with was an applied versus basic research institution (1 for applied; 0 for basic) <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and for the top 30 ranking of own institution (see above for details). We allow the effects of these two variables to differ before and after 1993, roughly the midpoint in our observation window and the year that Michael Smith received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing SDM.</p></div>

The evidence is only suggestive, however.</p><p>More compelling evidence of adoption consistent with middle-status anxiety and conformity is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Each of the four plots reports how the empirical hazard for low-, middle-, and high-status scientists varies with the exposure to prior adopters. We first organized all scientists at risk of adopting in any calendar year into one of 30 bins created by crossing three levels of status (bottom 20%, middle 60%, top 20%) against the 10 deciles of the coauthor contagion variable. Each of the 30 dots in a plot shows the fraction of adopters in each bin. The plots in the top row pertain to the 1988-1991 cohorts, those in the bottom row to the later cohorts. The plots on the left use citations as measure of status, those on the right use degree centrality. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We define basic research institutions as those directed toward developing big-picture understanding and enhancing general knowledge about biochemistry and molecular biology. Such institutions include departments of chemistry and biochemistry, and life science research centers where scientists work to enhance the understanding on the structure of genes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Statistical Hazard Models Without</head><p>Control Variables Before moving to the main analysis using nested casecontrol hazard modeling with control variables, we present some hazard model results with dummies for each decile of status but without control variables. Doing so for the full population with a traditional hazard model requires us to calculate the status and contagion variables for 28,001 rather than only 6,180 observations, but avoids the coding of many control variables. Such an analysis may be deemed informative if one sets aside concerns about omitted variable bias.</p><p>To maintain the proportional odds property of the multinomial logit model used in the nested case-control analysis, we use a discrete-time hazard model with logit link function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Iyengar et al. 2011, Van den Bulte and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Lilien 2001)</ref>. Making the latter fully comparable to the matched case-control model, however, would further require adding 10 × 32 × 3 = 960 year-by-countryby-specialty dummies to the model, and as many additional parameters to estimate (Prentice and Breslow <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Note, though, that legitimacy is more likely to increase with calendar time (regardless of cohort) than with cohort (regardless of calendar time). The model-free analysis does not disentangle these two time dimensions.  <ref type="bibr">16 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1988 cohort 1989 cohort 1990 cohort 1991 cohort 1978, p. 157</ref>). This model not only is inefficient but also resulted in a nonconcave likelihood function. Therefore, instead, we estimate three models: (i) a traditional discrete-time hazard model with logit link function, (ii) a case-control hazard model without matching on country and specialty, and (iii) our nested case-control hazard model with matching. Comparing the results for models (i) and (ii) shows to what extent the casecontrol approach leads to different point estimates and inflated standard errors compared to the traditional full-population approach. Comparing the results for models (ii) and (iii) shows to what extent controlling for otherwise unaccounted time-by-country-by-specialty affects the model estimates. Note, since model (i) uses a binary logit specification and models (ii) and (iii) use a multinomial logit specification, all slope coefficients can be interpreted as the change in log odds of adoption associated with a one-unit increase in the covariate holding all other covariates constant (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000, pp. 224-226</ref>). Hence, one can meaningfully use the coefficients to compare effect sizes across model specifications. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>(A) shows the results when status is measured as degree centrality. All three models show clear nonmonotonic patterns in both the propensity to adopt and the susceptibility to contagion. The point estimates (log odds) in the traditional hazard model and the nonmatched case-control hazard model are extremely similar. The estimated standard errors are larger in the case-control model, due to the reduced number of observations, but the differences are quite small. These two patterns are in complete agreement with what is to be expected based on the statistical properties of case-control models. The efficiency gained from not having to collect and code data on all members of the population at risk at any time does not come at the cost of bias or significant loss of statistical efficiency.</p><p>Contrasting the point estimates in the case-control models with and without matching leads to two insights. First, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries and specialties leads to larger estimated effect sizes. To the extent that such heterogeneity Notes. The three lines in each plot correspond to low, middle, or high status. The points on the horizontal axis are deciles of the peer exposure variables (coauthor adoptions).</p><p>matters but is uncorrelated with the included covariates, accounting for it reduces the true error variance and hence boosts the estimates in logit models identified only up to an arbitrary scaling of the error variance.</p><p>The second insight is that controlling for unobserved country and specialty characteristics through matching decreases the contagion effect in the first status decile and makes it insignificantly different from zero. This is consistent with prior evidence that failing to control for common contextual influences and other correlated unobservables can bias contagion effects upward (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aral et al. 2009</ref>, Van den Bulte and Lilien 2001). Finally, all three models lead to the same conclusion on when status effects are the largest. Both the tendency to adopt independently and the susceptibility to contagion are the highest in the seventh decile of the degree distribution.</p><p>All patterns in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>(A) are robust to including year dummies in the full-population model to make it more consistent with the case-control models in which years are already conditioned out, and robust to including age dummies in all models reflecting the flexible baseline hazard of a proper discrete-time proportional odds Cox hazard model (not shown here).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>(B) shows the results when status is measured through citations rather than degree centrality. Once again, all three models show clear nonmonotonic patterns in both the propensity to adopt and the susceptibility to contagion. Also, all three indicate that both status effects are the largest in the fourth and fifth deciles of the citations distribution. Just as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>(A), the full-population model leads to very similar point estimates and standard errors as the casecontrol model without matching. Also, controlling for common country and specialty characteristics through matching again decreases the contagion estimate in the first status decile, though it remains significantly different from zero this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Main Analysis with Degree Centrality</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> presents the results of various nested casecontrol models with control variables and status measured as degree centrality. Covariates moderating social contagion are always mean centered, so coefficients of nonmoderated contagion correspond to average or "main" effects.</p><p>Model 0 includes only the control variables. Though their effect sizes vary somewhat after adding variables of theoretical interest, the signs and significance levels are quite robust across models 0 through 5. The number of coauthors has no effect, but working with others who do not specialize in SDM does increase the odds of adopting quickly. Research supported by multiple sources of funding is associated with early adoption as well. Researchers are more likely to adopt quickly if they have used other commercial kits before, publish extensively on studying protein function but little on producing final protein products, are young, and received their Ph.D. at a school where several faculty members had used SDM kits before they graduated. Working at an institution focusing on applied versus basic research is associated with early adoption, especially before 1993. So does working at a highly ranked institution. Extending model 0 with the linear and quadratic effects of status (model 1) significantly improves model fit ( − 2LL = 117.88, p &lt; 0 01). Status has an inverse-U effect on the tendency to adopt early, consistent with the middle-status anxiety hypothesis.  Model 2 extends the analysis with contagion from past coauthors and allows the susceptibility to such contagion to vary nonmonotonically with status. This further improves model fit ( − 2LL = 10.54, p &lt; 0 05). Status has an inverse-U effect on contagion susceptibility, consistent with the middle-status conformity hypothesis.</p><p>Model 3 extends the analysis by assessing whether the influence of past coauthors increases with their usage level, usage diversity, status, and institutional status. Each of those source effects is allowed to vary nonmonotonically as a function of the potential adopter's status. These joint source and recipient contagion effects improve model fit quite markedly ( − 2LL = 625.24, p &lt; 0 01). There is an interesting pattern in the findings. Keeping the status of the potential adopter at the average, each of the four source characteristics matters   (p &lt; 0 01). Also, the effect of the two variables pertaining to sources' experience with SDM kits (usage level and diversity) is most pronounced among potential adopters of middle status. In contrast, the effect of the two variables pertaining to sources' status does not vary significantly with potential adopters' status. In short, (i) on average, potential adopters are sensitive to both the experience and the status of prior adopters they have collaborated with; (ii) people of middle-status are especially sensitive to the contagion sources' experience; and (iii) low-, middle-, or high-status people are equally sensitive to the contagion sources' status.</p><p>Model 4 shows that the middle-status conformity finding is not due to a confound with some "midcareer" or "middle-age" effect. Hence, to the extent that research ability and expertise first rise and then decline with age, this does not provide an alternative account for the nonmonotonic status in the data.</p><p>Marketing Science 33(4), pp. 509-533, © 2014 INFORMS Model 5 shows that shared departmental and university affiliations are not important conduits of contagion once closer collaboration ties are controlled for. Of the 18 covariates pertaining to contagion through common departmental or university affiliations introduced in model 5, only two have a significant effect. Prior adoption by high-status colleagues within one's own department increases the odds of adoption. Also, the behavior of colleagues within one's own department is less contagious in top-ranked institutions than in institutions of lower rank. This may occur because in top-ranked institutions, everyone considers themselves to be of above-average stature. Apart from these two traces of status-related contagion, there is no evidence of peer influence operating through mere departmental or university affiliation or collocation.</p><p>Even though only those two covariates have a significant effect at 95% confidence, adding all 18 covariates improves the model fit significantly ( − 2LL = 70.24, p &lt; 0 01) and affects the size of several of the control variables (applied versus basic research orientation of the institution; the number of SDM publications; and the number of funding sources). The effects of contagion through active collaboration, in contrast, are barely affected. This pattern suggests that the influence of departmental and institutional ties is more closely intertwined with mere contextual effects than with the effect of true collaborative network ties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Robustness Checks</head><p>One concern about the nonmonotonic results in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3  and 4</ref> is that they rely on a quadratic functional form. We therefore repeated the analyses by replacing status and status-squared in model 2 in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref> by dummies indicating which status decile the scientists belonged to. This is the same as extending the matched case-control models reported in Tables 2(A) and 2(B) with the control variables from model 0 in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3  and 4</ref>.

Hence, the "I am low status so I care less about status" assumption leading to the middle-status anxiety and conformity hypotheses may be less applicable to them. This would work against our hypotheses. On the other hand, junior researchers who are still completing their training might to some extent be following, by coercion or by choice, the research procedures set out by their senior Notes. For adoption propensity, the dots report the log odds of adopting for someone in the status decile compared to someone in the first decile.

If so, this would amount to a confound between power and status mechanisms and would provide an alternative explanation as to why the effects are similar at the two extremes of the status distribution. Both concerns are easily put to rest. Scientists who earned their Ph.D. less than five years ago accounted for only 7.5% of the population at risk in 1988 and only 7% in 1997. Also, as shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref>, the middle-status anxiety and conformity effects are robust to the inclusion of linear and quadratic academic age effects. Finally, we reestimated all models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> including only the observations for which both the case and all of its controls had earned their Ph.D. at least five years ago. The results pertaining to middle-status anxiety and conformity were robust.</p><p>We estimated two other variants of models 1-5 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> as additional robustness checks. The same conclusions about middle-status anxiety and conformity were obtained when operationalizing status as the number of citations to SDM papers specifically. Using this alternative measure, however, produces worse model fits than using network centrality or total citation count. One likely reason is that the higher frequency of zero counts makes it a coarser measure of status. The substantive findings pertaining to middle-status anxiety and conformity are also robust to operationalizing contagion in terms of the fraction rather than the number of past coauthors who have adopted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Additional Analyses</head><p>Though the theory does not require that people are correct in believing that adopting commercial SDM kits will boost their future status, such evidence might be viewed as strengthening our account of adoption behavior. We assess this using data on the 637 scientists in the 1988 and 1989 cohorts allowing us to perform within-scientist cross-temporal analysis of changes in status over nine years or more. We regress the natural logarithm of degree and of citations on a binary indicator for having adopted commercial SDM kits in the past. In such a semi-log model, exponentiating the regression coefficient b exp b − 1 × 100% gives the percentage increase in status associated with having adopted. We use annual dummies to control for common temporal variations, and either person fixed effects to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity or the lagged dependent variable to control for state dependency and heterogeneity. Having adopted is associated with a 20%-67% boost in status (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>).</p><p>The model-free analysis in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> suggests that middle-status effects may be more pronounced early   <ref type="bibr">(Wooldridge 2002, pp. 412-413)</ref>.</p><p>on than later. To directly test such systematic change, we reestimated models 2 and 3 in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref>, but allowing the effects of main theoretical interest to vary over time. Specifically, we organized the observations in three groups: (i) early cohort/early period, (ii) early cohort/late period, and (iii) late cohort/late period, where cohorts and years up to 1991 are early and those from 1992 onward are late. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref> reports the results on the contagion and status effects of these models, using the early cohort/early period group as the baseline.</p><p>The conclusion is the same for models 2 and 3 as base specification, and for degree and citations as measure of status: the early cohorts are less susceptible to contagion after 1992 than before. The difference in effect size is only small, however. Also, none of the other effects are significantly different early versus late. This indicates that the contagion and status considerations did not weaken markedly in our data window, though early cohorts did become somewhat less susceptible to contagion. The latter would be consistent with the kits becoming increasingly legitimized among those who had been active in the field before it experienced a boom as well as Michael Smith receiving the Nobel Prize for developing SDM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Alternative Explanations</head><p>Our findings likely reflect genuine associations between status and contagion on one hand and adoption behavior on the other. Though some alternative explanations are conceivable, they are not very credible given our research setting, data, and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Endogenous Tie Formation</head><p>One concern may be that the contagion coefficients capture not the effect of coauthors on adoption behavior but that of adoption behavior on the choice of who to collaborate with. Such endogenous tie formation requires that the decision to coauthor with particular peers is affected by the extent to which these prospective coauthors (are expected to) use commercial SDM kits. Two features of the data and the results indicate that such endogenous tie formation is not a credible rival explanation. First, and more importantly, those researchers who are most likely to adopt are those in the middle strata of degree centrality and citations and hence are not those most sought after to collaborate with, i.e., those with high degree centrality (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>; Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref>). Second, it is not clear how endogenous tie formation can explain the patterns in our data without invoking middle-status anxiety. Specifically, it is not clear how endogenous tie formation can imply that the propensity to adopt independently and the susceptibility to contagion are higher for middle-status than for low-or high-status researchers, unless it is for their above-average eagerness to advance their status by adopting productivity-boosting commercial kits or by building coauthorship ties to peers who are productive researchers because they use commercial kits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Reflection</head><p>Reflection arises when the peer behavior used to explain the actions of a focal researcher is actually caused by that very same researcher. This is not a credible threat, since we operationalize contagion in terms of lagged rather than current peer behavior and anyone at risk of adoption has by definition not adopted before and hence not triggered their peers to adopt through contagion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Iyengar et al. 2013)</ref>. Also, reflection cannot explain the nonmonotonic status effects in the propensity to adopt independently, and we are not aware of a scenario in which it might explain nonmonotonic status effects in the susceptibility to contagion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Correlated Unobservables</head><p>Our matched case-control design controls for any timeby-country-by-specialty effect. As a result, our findings cannot be confounded with the effects of contextual variables common to researchers in the same country or specialty, like marketing effort or the general sentiment toward using commercial kits.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Truncation Bias</head><p>Our analyses are not limited to only those who adopted, but use proper case-control hazard modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Langholz 2005, Prentice and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Breslow 1978)</ref>. Therefore, our contagion estimates do not suffer from upward truncation bias (Van den Bulte and Iyengar 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.">Expertise Effects</head><p>Yet another concern may be that what we posit as associations of adoption with status effects are actually associations with expertise. The argument would be that (i) low-expertise individuals do not understand the innovation enough, (ii) high-expertise individuals do not evaluate it well, and (iii) only in the middle range of expertise does an appropriate appreciation of the innovation occur. There are several reasons why this is not a compelling alternative account for our findings. First and foremost, premise (i) does not match our setting. The main appeal of commercial SDM kits was their ease of use. By providing a proven set of reagents and procedural steps described in detailed manuals, they made it easy even for relatively novice life scientists to conduct SDM successfully and efficiently. The premise that low-expertise researchers would somehow be unable to understand a simple, continuous innovation like commercial SDM kits is empirically unfounded and, more generally, conflicts with empirical findings in consumer research <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Moreau et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>That premise makes the expertise-based explanation of little to no relevance to our research setting, and makes it a noncredible alternative account for our findings. Second, although premise (i) is consistent with a low propensity for novices to adopt independently-at least for complex products and discontinuous innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Moreau et al. 2001</ref>)-it is difficult to reconcile with a low susceptibility to contagion. One would expect low-expertise individuals who feel that they do not understand a new product well enough to be more rather than less susceptible to contagion through social learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Iyengar et al. 2011)</ref>. Therefore, differences in expertise are not a viable explanation for the nonmonotonic pattern in susceptibility to contagion in our data (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Finally, and least importantly, we are not aware of prior research documenting claim (iii) about middle-expertise effects, whereas prior support does exist for middle-status effects.</p></div>

Also, we document inverse-U patterns in (i) and (ii). All three effects go beyond the notions that individuals are influential or influenceable merely because they are social hubs connected to many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Goldenberg et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Hinz et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">, Watts and Dodds 2007</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Implications for Diffusion Theory and Research</head><p>Status matters. Our findings support the notion that social status itself, rather than merely its economic and educational correlates, affects new product adoption and contagion dynamics. The convention of labeling consumption expressing social class positions as "status consumption" obfuscates the distinction between social class based on economic wealth as opposed to social status based on esteem and respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Üstüner and Holt 2010)</ref>. Even when attuned to the distinction, prior research has often struggled with separating the effects of status from those of economic resources, education, access to information, and ability (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cancian 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Han 1994</ref>. Our findings, in contrast, cannot be explained as being driven by such differences because they are of no relevance to the adoption of SDM kits by life scientists.</p><p>Middle-status anxiety. Consistent with sociological insights about middle-status anxiety, we find that status affects the propensity to adopt early in a nonmonotonic, inverse-U fashion. An important scope condition for this pattern, we expect, is that we focused on a product that adopters expected would help them be more productive researchers and so attain higher status. For innovations that do not offer the potential for status advancement, and especially for innovations with a high risk of status loss like those studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Phillips and Zuckerman (2001)</ref>, status anxiety implies not an inverse-U but a U-shaped relation between status and early adoption. The notion that status anxiety affects who adopts early (ceteris paribus) has implications for targeting and seeding, as we discuss below.</p><p>Middle-status conformity. Status also impacts the susceptibility to social contagion in a nonmonotonic, inverse-U fashion. This is consistent with middle-status conformity. This facet of our work complements the recent studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Lee et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Iyengar et al. (2011)</ref> reporting that people with high in-degree centrality were not more or less susceptible to social influence. It is possible that these studies did not detect a linear association between in-degree centrality and susceptibility because the true relation was nonmonotonic and, on average, nil. More likely, however, is that a necessary condition for middle-status conformity to operate did not hold in those studies. The physicians studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Iyengar et al. (2011)</ref> had little reason to expect that adopting the drug early versus late within a 17-month window would boost their status. Status need not have been very salient to the respondents in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Lee et al. (2010)</ref> study either.</p><p>Identifying the nature of the contagion mechanism. The frontier in adoption and contagion research is moving from merely documenting contagion (e.g., Bell and Song 2007) toward seeking sharper insights into the mechanisms driving adoption and contagion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aral 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Godes 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">, Van den Bulte 2010</ref>.

Our findings do not dispute this depiction, but suggest it is incomplete. The inverse-U patterns we document are consistent with adoption and contagion being driven by legitimation and competition for status, rather than other contagion mechanisms. Our research setting is one where the product was likely to be known to all and where all potential adopters had the economic and human capital to adopt immediately if they so desired. The inverse-U pattern between status and adoption propensity therefore suggests that middle-status individuals adopt early because of the motivation induced by status anxiety, rather than because of improving opportunity or ability through information dissemination. Similarly, the nonmonotonic pattern between status and susceptibility to contagion is consistent with people adopting in order to improve their status while being concerned about legitimacy, rather than adopting because of changes in the opportunity or ability to start using the new product.</p><p>Identifying the most influential customers. Our study investigated not only the nonmonotonic effects of the potential adopters' status but also whether contagion was moderated by the prior adopters' status and experience with the new product. Differential source influence within ties being driven by user experience versus status has been the topic of some recent debate, with all parties agreeing that the answer likely depends on the nature of the contagion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Godes 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Godes and Mayzlin 2009</ref>. The richness and size of our data allows us not only to operationalize both source effects separately using two metrics for each, but also to include all effects jointly in the model. We find that both experience and status matter, but in a somewhat different manner: (i) on average, potential adopters are sensitive to both the experience and the status of prior adopters; (ii) people of middle-status are especially sensitive to the contagion sources' experience; but (iii) low-, middle-, or high-status people are equally sensitive to the contagion sources' status.</p><p>The presence of different moderator effects suggests that the sources' experience and status affect potential adopters through different mechanisms. The most likely explanation is that experience persuasively conveys the new product's functional benefits, whereas status compellingly conveys its legitimacy. This would account for the finding that those most sensitive to source experience are middle-status scientists likely to be most keen to improve their status through research output. The finding that the effect of source status does not vary with recipient status is a bit more puzzling. The distinctions and interplay between expertise, experience, and status warrant more research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Goldenberg et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Trial versus repeat. Contagion can affect both trial and repeat behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Iyengar et al. 2013)</ref>. It is not obvious, however, whether middle-status effects would be stronger or weaker in repeat than in trial. On one hand, some research suggests that legitimacy starts to loom larger once concerns about the functional value of an innovation start to dissipate with use <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kennedy and Fiss 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">, Tolbert and Zucker 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">, Westphal et al. 1997</ref>). The basic mechanism purportedly at work is similar to that in Maslow's hierarchy of needs: social integration becomes more important once basic functional needs are met. On the other hand, one would expect concerns about legitimacy to ease as the innovation becomes accepted practice. Both processes may be at work, but at different time scales, such that legitimacy concerns first increase as attention shifts from functional performance to normative legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Iyengar et al. 2013</ref>) and then decrease as the innovation becomes legitimized (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>). Whether this is indeed so and whether middle-status effects exhibit a similar dynamic is of substantial theoretical interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Implications Beyond New Product Diffusion</head><p>Consumers use products and brands to build, signal, and maintain social status. This has attracted much attention, but research to date has ignored nonmonotonic patterns consistent with middle-status anxiety and conformity. Future research would benefit from moving beyond linear contrasts among subjects and narrow ranges of the status spectrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellezza et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Berger and Ward 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Han et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">, Ordabayeva and Chandon 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">, Üstüner and Holt 2010</ref>.</p><p>Gaining and maintaining status is one of the reasons why customers engage in brand communities and share user-generated content in public forums. Being sensitive to status anxiety and conformity motives may improve marketers' understanding of such customer engagement and of the market monitoring data it generates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Stewart (2005)</ref>, for instance, documents that in an online community where status is determined in part by peer recognition for having made a valuable contribution, members of the second-highest status group were the most active in giving such tokens of recognition. Are other behaviors in such forums, like discussions and product ratings, also subject to nonmonotonic status effects rather than only monotonic effects documented recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Moe and Schweidel 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">, Shen et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">, Toubia and Stephen 2013</ref>?</p><p>Middle-status considerations can also affect product line and market entry decisions in professional services and credence goods industries <ref type="bibr">Zuckerman 2001, Podolny 2005)</ref>. Organizations operating in markets having not only a generally agreed upon stratification but even publicly visible rankings include not only universities and business schools, investment banks, audit companies, law firms, and strategy consulting firms for which both rankings and network data are available, but also many medical, legal, financial, and real estate services geared toward local consumers and for which city-specific magazines publish "best of" lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Implications for Practice</head><p>Marketers and consultants struggle with identifying customers with above-average social influence, and some have even suggested that trying to identify such influentials or opinion leaders is futile. The difficulty of identifying them using demographics and psychographics has led some to question the relevance of opinion leadership <ref type="bibr">(Thompson 2008, Watts and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Dodds 2007)</ref>. Our findings suggest that there is no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater.</p><p>Practitioners can find comfort in our finding that network centrality-a standard measure of status and opinion leadership that is increasingly easy to collect data on-is systematically associated with time of adoption, contagiousness within ties, and susceptibility to such influence. The ineffectiveness of demographics and psychographics to identify influentials and susceptibles is likely due to inept measures rather than useless concepts and marketing frameworks.</p><p>Assuming that "more is always better" may also have contributed to the lack of success in prior studies and field applications. Looking for a linear effect when the true pattern is nonmonotonic may have led some to erroneously conclude that the concept of opinion leadership and its metrics are of little value.</p><p>Our findings also have implications for whom to target with the objective of gaining market traction quickly and leveraging the power of contagion. When the product has the potential to improve status, those most likely to adopt early will not be those at the top of the hierarchy and those most susceptible to contagion will not be those at the bottom. Instead, they will be those in the middle. Focusing one's marketing efforts exclusively on the most influential or contagious customers at the high end of the sociometric degree distribution or status hierarchy need not be the most effective strategy when the product offers the opportunity to boost one's status, and customers in the middle are more likely to adopt both independently and through contagion. Astute marketers launching such a new product will be mindful to not only leverage the high-status customers who are the most "influential" but also target the middle-status customers who are the most "switchable" toward the new product <ref type="bibr">(Gensch 1984, Slywotzky and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Shapiro 1993)</ref>. Hence, optimal targeting when launching a status-enhancing product subject to contagion is likely to consist of a mix of highand middle-status prospects. Empirical tests of this claim would be valuable.</p></div>

Let zk be a set of six individuals consisting of the case k and its five controls, all of whom are at risk of adopting at time t k , under control selection scheme z. For z = 1, the controls are chosen randomly; for z = 2, the controls are matched with k on time-invariant characteristics. Let P z kt k be the conditional probability that, among the members of the set zk , it is the case rather than any of the controls who adopts. Also, let X jt k be a row vector of variables and let z be a column vector of parameters to be estimated; P z kt k is modeled using a conditional logit specification:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P z kt k =</formula><p>exp X kt k z j∈ zk exp X jt k z</p><p>(3)</p><p>The conditional log-likelihood for the adoptions and nonadoptions in the case-control data set then equals</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">LL z = K k=1 ln P z kt k = K k=1</formula><p>ln exp X kt k z j∈ zk exp X jt k z</p><p>(4)</p><p>The case-control models are conditional logit models with the usual identification constraints. They have no intercept and the z parameters are identified only up to the scale of the unaccounted random shocks. To the extent that the latter is smaller with matching than without matching, the estimates of 1 and 2 will differ accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation of parameters</head><p>The coefficients in and z capture the effects of covariates on the log odds of adoption, and so have the same interpretation. The IIA property of the conditional logit model implies that sampling on the dependent variable in the case-control design does not create a bias in the slope coefficients. As a result, the estimated coefficients in in a full-population binary hazard logit model are asymptotically identical to the estimated coefficients in 1 in a case-control conditional logit model without matching. In practice, little efficiency is gained from using more than five controls per case.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2Histograms of Status Measures: Degree and Citations Degree (scientist-years at-risk, NT = 28,001) Citations (scientist-years at-risk, NT = 28,001)</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">The asymmetric influence and pure-type two-segment diffusion models of<ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Van den Bulte and Joshi (2007)</ref> are a partial exception. They are consistent with a situation where middle-status consumers are more susceptible to social influence than both low-and high-status consumers (Van denBulte and Joshi 2007, pp. 403-404). However, the models do not focus on status per se, and neither does the empirical analysis reported by the authors.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">The link between performance and status can be moderate even when purely objective data on performance is available, as documented in<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Erickson and Nosanchuk's (1984)</ref> study of bridge players.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">The consistency between middle-status conformity and the goal gradient is noted byHarvey and Consalvi (1960, pp. 182 and 186). Several studies document cumulative advantages in science, such that maintaining high status is easier than attaining it (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allison et al. 1982)</ref>.<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Erickson and Nosanchuk (1984)</ref> find that better-known bridge players get a higher status boost for the same objective level</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We exclude a small number of scientists specializing in computer modeling, assuming that they will never use a kit for an experiment and so are not part of the "population at risk" for adopting a commercial SDM kit.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Since not everyone had published their first SDM paper in the same year within the 1988-1997 window, not everyone became at risk of adopting SDM kits at the same time. Hence, matching on calendar time implies that the members of the risk set need not have been at risk of adopting as long as the case was at the time the latter adopted. In a case-control design, cases and controls need not be members of the same "birth cohort" (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Langholz 2005)</ref>. Our model includes cohort dummies, so the baseline hazard (duration dependency) is allowed to vary nonparametrically.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">Two judges, a life scientist with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, and a marketing scientist with a Ph.D. in marketing and over 10 professional certificates in biochemistry, coded, categorized, and counted the usage domain of each SDM kit application by each user. The reliability of the coding was assessed by presenting a sample of 50 applications to seven additional judges who were Masters or Ph.D.s in biochemistry. The overall interjudge agreement was 95%, which resulted in a Perreault index of 0.96<ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Perreault and Leigh 1989)</ref> and a Proportional Reduction in Loss of 1<ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rust and Cooil 1994)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">We used U.S. News and World Report rankings for the world's best universities in Life Sciences and Biomedicine, supplemented when necessary by the rankings from the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the Academic Ranking of World Universities. For institutions for which no information was available for 1988-1997, we use the first available ranking after 1997.</note>
