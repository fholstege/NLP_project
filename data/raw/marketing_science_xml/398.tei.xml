<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Store brands (SBs) continue to grow in sales and volume in the U.S. market, extending a trend that began years ago but was accelerated by the recession: "In supermarkets, store brands advanced to 19.1% in dollar share and unit share was 23.5%. In drug stores, store brands moved up in dollar share to 14.7% and recorded unit share of 16.2%. For total outlets, store brands dollar share rose to 17.4%, while unit share came in at 21.8%" (Private Label Manufacturers Association 2011, p. 1). Their success, however, is often to the detriment of national brands (NBs). When faced with a potential or realized threat of an SB, an NB can compete against this threat by revisiting the four P's of marketing: product, price, promotion (advertising), and place (supply chain). We focus primarily on the first two P's with the goal of answering the following questions:</p><p>(1) How should an NB compete with the threat of an SB entry? Should it compete only on price, or should it use a product line strategy? If only on price, should the NB reposition its product?</p><p>(2) Can the entry of an SB lead to a product line expansion of the incumbent national brand manufacturer (NBM)? If yes, what would be the positioning of the new products the NBM offers relative to its existing brand and the position of the SB?</p><p>(3) Under what conditions would an incumbent NBM eliminate a competing SB supplier by providing either (a) a better-quality SB product or (b) an SB product of the same quality at a lower wholesale price?</p><p>We theorize that when competing with SBs, an NBM can generally pursue one of three broad strategies in the positioning space: accommodate, displace, or buffer.</p><p>We say that the NBM accommodates if he repositions its existing products (i.e., adjusts qualities and/or wholesale prices) only, without changing the total number of products in his product line. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Examples of accommodation include Coke and Pepsi, which in the 1980s refused to supply Canadian grocers with an SB soft drink. The grocers found another source, Cott Corporation, which became a considerable threat to the two big cola makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dunne and Narasimhan 1999</ref>).</p><p>Nasser, Turcic, and Narasimhan: National Brand's Response to Store Brands 592 Marketing Science 32(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">591-608, © 2013 INFORMS</ref> We say that the NBM displaces if he repositions his existing product and elects to supply the SB himself, thereby preempting the entry of the outsider. Examples of the displacement strategy include Alcoa's generic aluminum foil and McCormick's generic spices and seasonings. Both generics are sold next to the leading NBs, also supplied by Alcoa and McCormick's, at various retailers nationwide <ref type="bibr">(Private Label Buyer 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we say that the NBM buffers if, in addition to repositioning its existing products, he adds a defender (or flanker) product to his product line to fight the SB. The equilibrium demand for the defender, the SB, and the leading NB, however, remains strongly positive. Examples of buffering observed in practice include 3M's Highland version of Post-it notes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ritson 2009</ref>) and L&amp;M, Basic, and Chesterfield brands, which Phillip Morris has effectively used around the world to flank Marlboro <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Quelch and Harding 1996)</ref>.</p><p>To explore when an NBM would adopt which strategy, we construct a game-theoretic model of a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of product quality and analyze the product line design of an NBM that sells his product(s) through a retailer. We analyze two regimes. In the first regime (see §4), our baseline case, the NBM is a monopolist. Assuming that product line expansion is costly, we use this regime to derive a set of conditions on the model parameters under which the NBM chooses to supply only one NB product. We then assume that the same conditions are in force in our second regime, in which the retailer has the added option of procuring an SB product from independent, dedicated SB manufacturers that supply it at marginal cost (see § §5.1 and 5.2). Anticipating this threat, we explore how the NBM's strategic choices of products and prices would be affected (see §5.3). Throughout our analyses, we endogenize the number of products the NBM produces, their qualities, and their wholesale prices, with the goal of answering the above research questions. The answers we propose are driven by two explanatory factors, operationalized in our model as exogenous parameters. The first factor, NBM's cost advantage, measures the NBM's ability to supply the SB vis-à-vis the retailer's cost of acquiring it. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The second factor, NBM's differentiation ability, measures the NBM's ability to raise the quality of his product(s) to differentiate them from the SB. The results we find are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We find that whenever the NBM's cost advantage is weak (i.e., the SB is very cheap), he simply accommodates the SB by increasing quality and reducing the wholesale price of the incumbent NB. The optimality of expanding the product line in response to SB competition is perhaps our most important and least intuitive result, as it demonstrates that the net marginal profit the NBM can gain from introducing an additional product can be higher under competition than under monopoly. In other words, our results suggest that product line expansion can be more effective at improving a bad (competitive) situation than it is at improving a good (monopolistic) one. Thus, our main contribution to the SB literature is in clearly characterizing the conditions under which the NBM would elect to be the supplier of an SB himself and when he would compete by expanding his product line. Several authors identify this as an important direction for future research (see Pauwels and Srinivasan 2009, § §3.4.1 and 4.3; Sethuraman 2009, §5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Although the marketing of SBs is controlled by retailers, the presence of SBs impacts all three market participants: consumers, retailers, and manufacturers. Retailers introduce SBs primarily for three reasons: (1) to expand the category, (2) to use SBs as a strategic threat to elicit concessions from NBMs, and (3) to create and build store equity/loyalty among their consumers to gain competitive edge against other retailers. The existing literature has largely focused on these incentives as well as on empirical analysis of the effects of SBs on competition. We summarize this below. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pauwels and Srinivasan (2009)</ref> argue that "one of the most important activities for supermarket retailers is the creation and marketing of store brands" (p. 258). The incentive to introduce an SB increases with category sales, margins, and cross-price elasticity of demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Raju et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Dhar and Hoch 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Horowitz 2000</ref>. An SB introduction ordinarily allows retailers to expand a category and serve consumers that have not been served well by the existing NBs (for empirical results, see <ref type="bibr">Gruca et al. 2001, Pauwels and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srinivasan 2004)</ref>. To see how changes in product line design are affected by channel dynamics, see Villas-Boas (1998), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dukes et al. (2009)</ref>, and Liu and Cui (2010).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Narasimhan and Wilcox (1998)</ref> show that even when there is no market expansion, retailers have an incentive to introduce an SB to elicit better wholesale price terms from competing manufacturers. They identify perceived risk and retailers' ability to procure a quality SB comparable to an NB as important determinants for the penetration of SBs and of categorylevel drivers (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mills 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ailawadi and Harlam 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Bonfrer and Chintagunta 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Meza and Sudhir 2010</ref>. Given that the retailer can procure them by negotiation and through competitive bidding, SBs also frequently yield higher margins for the retailer than do NBs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sayman et al. 2002, Pauwels and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Srinivasan 2004)</ref>. Finally, SBs can help the retailer build loyalty in a crowded retail market. Because SBs are exclusive to the store that distributes them, they give a unique identity and association with the store and can create consumer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dick et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Corstjens and Lal 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Ailawadi et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sudhir and Talukdar (2004)</ref> show that SBs contribute more to store differentiation than to greater price sensitivity in the retail market.</p><p>There has also been significant research on how retailers should position an SB relative to the incumbent NBs and how to price both product types for retail category profit maximization. Many studies conclude that it is optimal for a retailer to position her SB against the leading NB <ref type="bibr">(Sayman et al. 2002, Scott-Morton and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zettelmeyer 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Du et al. (2005)</ref> sharpen this finding by identifying situations where it is best to position the SB close to the weaker NB or to position it in the "middle" so that it appeals to both NBs' target segments, and the authors suggest easy-to-implement ways for a retailer to determine which strategy is best to use. In addition, they confirm that introducing an SB not only allows the retailer to gain a higher share of the channel profits through higher retail margins but also often benefits the retailer through increases in NB unit sales. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sayman and Raju (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choi and Coughlin (2006)</ref> generalize the idea of positioning an SB against the leading NB by concluding that the introduction of multiple SBs in the same category is optimal when there are multiple differentiated NBs. For a more comprehensive set of results about the impact on retailers, see excellent reviews by <ref type="bibr">Sethuraman (2009, §4)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pauwels and Srinivasan (2009)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the literature on optimal retail strategies, the literature on how manufacturers can use product lines and prices to respond to new competition is less comprehensive. In a setting where a manufacturer sells directly to consumers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gabszewicz et al. (1986)</ref> show that the optimal number of products depends on the distribution of consumer valuations. In a related paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gabszewicz and Thisse (1980)</ref> establish that as the number of product varieties in an industry reaches a certain bound, any entry of a new product variety will result in the exit of an incumbent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brander and Eaton (1984)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gilbert and Matutes (1993)</ref> clarify how manufacturers choose the number and characteristics of the products they produce to compete and preempt certain positions in the product space.</p><p>The extant literature on how manufacturers that sell through a retailer should react to anticipated or actual SB product entry is even more sparse. Empirically, we understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pauwels and Srinivasan 2004)</ref> how SB product introduction affects the incumbent NBs: generic SBs tend to compete with second-tier NBs, whereas the first-tier brands are frequently able to maintain both wholesale price and market share. Intuitively, the incumbent NBs' positioning should also affect their optimal defensive strategy-previous literature suggests that NBs closest to (furthest from) the SB entrant should cut (raise) wholesale price <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hauser and Shugan 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Lal 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Gruca et al. 2001</ref>. However, price reaction is a short-term strategy.</p><p>More recent literature explores whether NBMs may be better off by supplying the SB to the retailer. Using an empirical methodology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2010)</ref> investigate conditions under which the NBM would choose to supply the SB. They study a very specific category: liquid milk. This category is characterized by a relatively small difference in the quality between the SBs and NBs, often greater consumer valuation for the SB than for the NB, and the absence of dedicated SB manufacturers. Their results reveal that when two NB milk producers compete, the lower-cost producer finds it optimal to also supply the SB. An important difference between <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2010)</ref> and our model is that they exogenously impose a product line design. Therefore, in their model, it is difficult to tease out whether the additional profit from supplying the SB can be uniquely attributed to the SB or if a similar result could be achieved by expanding the product line with other NBs.</p><p>The paper that is the closest to ours is <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kumar et al. (2010)</ref>, who investigate the question of whom a profit-maximizing retailer should optimally choose as her SB supplier-an incumbent NBM or an independent dedicated SB manufacturer. They study a two-consumer (high/low) segment model with one NBM, one retailer, and one independent, dedicated SB supplier. Their analysis shows that the retailer optimally chooses the NBM to supply the SB if (a) the size of the high-type customer segment is large relative to the low-type customer segment, (b) the valuations of the high-type customer segment are large relative to the low-type customer segment, and (c) the retailer's margin requirement on the SB is not very high. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kumar et al. (2010)</ref>, however, we assume a continuous distribution of consumer valuations, and Marketing Science 32(4), pp. 591-608, © 2013 INFORMS we endogenize the choices of the manufacturer and retailer and derive the wholesale and retail margins.</p><p>To summarize, relative to the existing literature, we completely characterize the optimal response of a strategic manufacturer facing a strategic retailer and an SB threat. In the product strategy and pricing space, we show that the diverse strategies we observe in the real world can be explained by our model's equilibrium predictions. We illustrate when a manufacturer would compete with just price, when he would become an SB supplier, and when he would compete by expanding his product line in the presence of an SB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Model</head><p>We consider a supply chain with a monopolist retailer, an NBM, and a competitive market of manufacturers supplying an unbranded product at marginal cost. The products in this market are described uniquely by a simple index of quality. We begin by describing consumers, retailer, and manufacturers. Then we describe the decision sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Consumers</head><p>Consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of product quality and buy at most one unit of a product offered at different quality levels. Let v j and p j denote the quality and the retail price, respectively, of product j, and let be the consumer's marginal willingness to pay for quality. Then a consumer derives the following utility from buying product j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U j = v j − p j</formula><p>where ∼ 0 1 (1)</p><p>Consumers pick product k such that U k &gt; 0 and U k ≥ U j for all j = k. If U k &lt; 0, then consumers do not buy in this category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Retailer</head><p>The profit-maximizing retailer sets the retail prices for all the products she decides to carry. We consider two cases: (i) the baseline case and (ii) the competitive case.</p><p>In the baseline case, the retailer can decide to carry up to N products offered by the NBM (see §3.3), and she sets retail prices p 1 p 2 so as to achieve max</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p 1 p 2 n=1 2 p n − w n d n (2)</formula><p>where w n and d n denote product n's wholesale price and demand, respectively. In the competitive case, the retailer has access to the products offered by the NBM as well as to a perfectly competitive market of fringe SB manufacturers offering an unbranded product, which the retailer can sell as an SB. Let v s and denote the quality and wholesale price (marginal cost), respectively, of the SB. Without loss of generality, we normalize v s to 1. As such, represents the price that the retailer pays for an SB product of quality 1. Analogously, we use d s to denote demand for the SB product, and the retailer sets retail prices so as to achieve max</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p s p 1 p 2 p s − d s + n=1 2 p n − w n d n (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">National Brand Manufacturer</head><p>The profit-maximizing NBM offers the retailer up to N products with qualities indexed in descending order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v N ≤ v N −1 ≤ • • • ≤ v 1 .</formula><p>The NBM is strategic in the sense that his product line design takes into account the retailer behavior see <ref type="bibr">(Villas-Boas 1998, §3.3)</ref>. We assume that the NBM's marginal production cost function is convex in product quality and operationalize it as c n = v 2 n ≥ 0. The cost parameter, , is directly related to the NBM's ability to differentiate his products from those of his competitors. For example, a low (high) level of indicates that the NBM has a high (low) ability to differentiate his products. The notation = − is used to denote the difference between the retailer's cost of acquiring one unit of the SB and the NBM's cost of producing it-we refer to as the NBM's differentiation ability and as the NBM's cost advantage. The analysis is carried out on the entire feasible range of and , which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S = − ≤ ≤ 3 5 − 0 ≤ ≤ 1 6 (4)</formula><p>As will be seen, for all &gt; 1/6 the NBM may choose to offer an NB product with quality below the SB's, which is not interesting. However, for all &gt; 3/5 − , the SB is uncompetitive and becomes irrelevant;</p><p>≥ 0 implies − ≤ . Considering the entire feasible range, S, is appealing because as empirical findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barsky et al. (2002)</ref> reveal, the marginal production costs required to produce national brand products often diverge from those required to produce SBs.</p><p>The NBM sets product qualities and wholesale prices to attain 3 max</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">w 1 w 2 v 1 v 2 n=1 2 N w n − c n d n − N × F (5)</formula><p>where F is a fixed setup cost the NBM incurs for each product version he decides to produce. One can think of F as the cost of setting up production of a particular product version, or the cost of branding. (Where useful, the notation N is used to indicate the NBM's gross profit; N = N − N × F is used to indicate the NBM's profit net of fixed cost.)</p><p>The fixed cost of the SB manufacturers is normalized to 0, implying that they do not have to incur </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x bsln1 1/1 n/a Baseline 2 2 No n/a bsln2 bsln2 x bsln2 1/2 x bsln2 2/2 Accommodate 1 Yes &gt; 0 acmd acmd x acmd 1/1 n/a Buffer 2 Yes &gt; 0 bffr bffr x bffr 1/2 x bffr 2/2 Displace 2 Yes = 0 dspl dspl x dspl 1/2 x dspl 2/2</formula><p>a Where useful, product-specific profits have superscripts (bsln1, one-product baseline case; bsln2, two-product baseline case; acmd, accommodation case; bffr, buffer case; dspl, displacement case).</p><p>b The variable x is a placeholder for variables v = quality, w = wholesale price, p = retail price, d = demand).

Their production processes are therefore often structured differently (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes and Wheelwright 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krajewski and Ritzman 2004, §3;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chryssolouris 2006, §1)</ref>. By far the most common manufacturing process for products that are produced in small-to medium-sized shipments is a batch process. In contrast, products that do not require customization for individual retailers and are put out in large volumes are produced by line or continuous flow processes. Relevant to us are the cost differences between these processes: compared to the much less flexible line process, the batch process is characterized by lower fixed costs (here, normalized to 0) and higher marginal costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Game Sequence and Notation</head><p>What follows is a sequence of stages in the game between the NBM, the retailer, and the consumers (vectors are in bold):</p><p>Stage 1. The NBM chooses how many product versions, N , to produce.</p><p>Stage 2. The NBM sets the qualities, v, and wholesale prices, w.</p><p>Stage 3. The retailer chooses which and how many product versions, N ≤ N , to carry and whether to carry the SB product (if available).</p><p>Stage 4. The retailer sets retail prices, p.</p><p>Stage 5. Each consumer chooses whether to buy and which product version to buy.</p><p>Note that we could have combined Stages 1 and 2 and Stages 3 and 4; we separated them for expositional clarity. In Lemma 1 (see Appendix A), we establish conditions on qualities v and wholesale prices w under which N = N . In other words, the condition says that the profit-maximizing retailer does not drop an arbitrary product n if its quality is sufficiently different from the qualities of products n−1 and n+1 and if its wholesale price is not too high. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For reference, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> lists additional notation used in the remainder of the paper. The proofs of all propositions are presented in Appendix A.</p><p>The objective of our paper is to illustrate the impact SB competition has on the NBM's product line, positioning, and pricing strategies. Our analysis can be seen as an analytical experiment that isolates the impact of the SB and determines the NBM's optimal response to SB competition. For this analysis, we compare a baseline case without the threat of an SB to the competitive case. This approach describes either an incumbent NBM that had operated in a market without SB competition for a substantial length of time before the SB entered the market or an incumbent NBM that has foresight and correctly anticipates the retailer's choice of the SB when designing the qualities of the NB product line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Baseline Case: Equilibrium Without SB Competition</head><p>We begin with the analysis of our baseline case, which is a game where the NBM is the sole producer of goods. Our central result in this section is Proposition 1, which establishes that if the fixed cost F is in the range 1/ 675 1/ 54 , then the NBM designs only one product and the retailer decides to carry this product. This result becomes an important reference point later in the paper when we analyze the competitive effect of the SB.</p><p>Proposition 1. Let F = 1/ 675 andF = 1/ 54 and suppose the NBM faces no SB competition. Whenever F ∈ F F , the NBM produces only one NB product and the retailer decides to carry it.

Suppose that by expanding his product line from one to two products, the NBM were to deviate from the equilibrium identified in Proposition 1. We use the mnemonics "bsln1" and "bsln2" to denote the oneproduct and two-product cases, respectively. We summarize the NBM's equilibrium product attributes and payoffs in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>.</p><p>The increase of the product line size has two effects on the NBM's profits: a market expansion effect (EXP, +) and a cannibalization effect (SC, −). The expansion effect of switching from one to two products is defined as the profit the NBM earns from the second, low-quality product. That is, EXP bsln ≡ bsln2 2/2 . The cannibalization effect is defined as the difference between the profit the NBM earns from selling the high-quality product from the two-product portfolio and the profit he earns from selling only one product. That is, SC bsln ≡ bsln2 1/2 − bsln1 1/1 . From The net effect, EXP bsln + SC bsln , although positive, is clearly less than F , leading the NBM to abandon the second product in the absence of competition. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> For this result to hold in general, however, it must also be established that for any 1 ≤ m &lt; n, the net expansion and cannibalization effects of the mth product is always larger than the net expansion and cannibalization effects of the nth product. We present this step in the formal of proof of Proposition 1, which is included in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Competitive Case: Equilibria with SB Competition</head><p>Recall from Proposition 1 that, as long as F is bound within the prescribed range, in the absence of SB competition, a monopolist NBM will introduce only one product. Now, suppose the retailer has an alternative supplier capable of producing a product at the quality level of 1. An interesting question arises: Should the NBM expand his product line, and if so, what qualities should he choose? In the presence of SB competition, the NBM has many strategic options in the product line, positioning (quality), and pricing space. We summarize the strategic choices of the NBM in Stages 1 and 2 of the game described in §3.4 in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where we provide a descriptive label for the NBM's strategy in each subgame or option.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, "accommodate" refers to not responding through product line, but only through adjusting the quality and price of his single offering. "Augment" means to expand the product line with a defender product. Here, there are two potential choices: (i) "buffer," where the NBM inserts a second product between his premium-quality product and the SB such that both NB products and the SB have positive sales; or (ii) "displace," where through his choices of product qualities, the NBM preempts the SB entry by effectively supplying an SB product to the retailer that eliminates her incentive to procure the SB from an outside supplier. Note that this second product the NBM supplies may be of higher quality than what the retailer would have obtained from the competitive fringe. Further, regardless of the strategy pursued, the NBM may adjust the quality of his premium product to be above or below the choice he would have made in the absence of the competitive threat.</p><p>As evident from Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, an NBM may alter his product line in terms of both the number of products and their qualities. Per our earlier discussion, a second product has two effects on the NBM's profits: a market expansion effect (EXP, +) and a cannibalization effect (SC, −). The net effect, although positive, was less than F , leading the NBM to abandon the second product in the absence of competition. However, in the presence of the competitive SB threat, the calculus changes. The comparison now is whether EXP + SC − F is greater than the loss that would result if the NBM were to maintain the status quo by keeping one product (even allowing for endogenously adjusting its quality). Given the NBM's choices, the retailer strategically decides which product(s) to stock and at what prices. Based on the NBM's choices of qualities for his products, it is possible that, under some conditions, the retailer might abandon the pursuit of the outside supplier and instead choose a product supplied by the NBM, leading to the "displacement" of the outside supplier.</p><p>For expositional clarity, we discuss the subgames of Stages 2-5 conditional on the product line decision of Stage 1. Then we explore whether to accommodate or "fight back" with a broader product line in §5.3. One product (accommodate) Two products (augment) Buffer Displace (outside SB is displaced)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s = 1 1/1 acmd s = 1 2/2 bffr bffr 1/2 1 1/1 dspl 1/1 dspl</formula><p>We proceed to solve for the full equilibrium through backward induction by examining the subgames corresponding to the three nodes in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: accommodate, buffer, and displace. In each subgame, we solve for retail prices as a function of and substitute the retailer's choices in the NBM's profit function to obtain the NBM's profit in each subgame. In all the equilibria we derive, the NBM designs the product line while taking retailer behavior into account, such that that the profit-maximizing retailer chooses not to exclude any NB products offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Equilibrium Choices When Competing with</head><p>One Product (Accommodation) When the NBM competes against the SB with a single offering, we say that the NBM accommodates the SB. Compared with the monopoly case, here, the NBM chooses to supply a higher-quality product at a lower price; i.e., w acmd 1/1 ≤ w bsln1 1/1 and v bsln1 1/1 ≤ v acmd 1/1 . With the existence of an SB, the aggregate demand expands and the retailer is clearly better off. As shown in <ref type="bibr">Figure 2(a)</ref>, for low values of , the NBM's one product lets the SB enjoy positive demand. There is a small region that exists for high values of , where the NBM sets the quality and wholesale price of its product such that the retailer drops the SB. The mechanics of how the NBM sets qualities and wholesale prices to drive the SB demand to zero will be discussed in further detail in the next section under the displacement strategy. Because the accommodation case is straightforward, we relegate the analysis details to Appendix B; however, note that we use the results from the appendix to illustrate when accommodation versus augmentation would prevail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Equilibrium Choices When Competing with</head><p>Two Products (Augmentation) Suppose the NBM competes against the SB with two products with qualities v 1/2 and v 2/2 , where 1 ≤ v 2/2 &lt; v 1/2 . We will refer to the high-quality NB product as the premium NB and to the lower-quality NB product as the defender. As we state in Stage 3 of the game, the retailer chooses which products to carry. She will carry the premium NB if</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">w 1/2 &lt; v 1/2 − v 2/2 + w 2/2 , the defender if w 2/2 &lt; v 1/2 − v 2/2 w s + v 2/2 − 1 w 1/2 / v 1/2 − 1 ,</formula><p>and the SB if w s &lt; w 2/2 /v 2/2 . 6 Since the NBM internalizes the retailer's optimal response, the first two conditions are always satisfied by the NBM's interior solution based on his firstorder conditions (FOCs). The NBM has two basic options: use the defender to buffer the SB by setting the quality and wholesale price of the defender such that w s &lt; w 2/2 /v 2/2 or displace the SB by setting w 2/2 /v 2/2 ≤ w s . To analytically characterize the range of where buffering dominates displacement, we begin with retail demands for the two NBs and the SB:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d 1/2 = 1− p 1/2 −p 2/2 v 1/2 −v 2/2 d 2/2 = p 1/2 −p 2/2 v 1/2 −v 2/2 − p 2/2 −p s v 2/2 −1 and d s = p 2/2 −p s v 2/2 −1 −p s (6)</formula><p>Using ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), the retailer solves (3), where the maximum is achieved by taking</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p 1/2 = v 1/2 + w 1/2 2 p 2/2 = v 2/2 + w 2/2</formula><p>2 and p s = 1 + + 2 By substituting the retail prices, we obtain demands as functions of wholesale prices (we use the notation + to denote the positive part):  Given the demand functions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">7</ref>), the NBM will set wholesale prices and qualities so as to maximize his profits as specified in Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) with N = 2.

Therefore, everything else being equal, an attractively priced defender will displace the SB. On the other hand, if w 2/2 /v 2/2 &gt; + , the retailer will decide to carry the SB, implying that a less attractively priced defender will merely buffer the SB.</p><p>Proposition 2 below characterizes the parameter ranges where buffering and displacement survive in the subgame equilibrium. For expositional clarity, we describe the equilibria for two important cases: high ( ∈ A H ) and low ( ∈ A L ), descriptive of an NBM with low and high differentiation ability. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The sets A H and A L can be seen graphically in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> and are formally defined in Appendix C.

Although the defender product takes sales away from the SB, all three products receive positive demand (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(c)), and the retailer does not drop the SB. <ref type="bibr">Figure 3(a)</ref> shows how the qualities of the premium NB and of the defender, v bffr 1/2 and v bffr 2/2 , compare with the quality of the NB product in the baseline case, v bsln1 1/1 . From these, we can clearly see that effective buffering requires that the defender product be positioned so as to take more sales away from the SB than from the premium NB, which the NBM achieves by distorting the quality of the premium NB upwards (relative to the baseline case).</p><p>In contrast as part (ii) of Proposition 2 shows, it is costly for a low-differentiation ability (high ) NBM to raise the quality of his premium NB and produce a high-quality defender. As a result, the NBM finds it optimal to set the quality of the premium NB close to Buffer Displace</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">= - = - = - = - d 1/2 bffr = d 2/2 bffr d 1/2 bffr = d 2/2 bffr d 1/2 dspl dspl -d 2/2 d 1/1 bsln1 d 1/1 bsln1 v 1/1 bsln1 d 2/2 dspl d 1/2 dspl bffr dspl bffr dspl v 1/2 dspl v 1/2 dspl v 2/2 bffr v 1/2 bffr v 1/2 bffr v 2/2 bffr v 2/2 dspl = v s v 2/2 dspl &gt; v s v 1/1 bsln1</formula><p>the baseline case (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b)). To minimize cannibalization, however, the NBM must now distort the quality of the defender downwards (relative to the buffering case). This means that for high-range values of , the equilibrium quality of the defender product, v dspl 2/2 , is much lower than the buffering quality, v bffr 2/2 , but continues to exceed the quality of the SB, v s . For midrange values of , the quality of the defender matches the SB's quality. In both cases, the defender is optimally priced to match the SB's retail margin by setting w</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">dspl 2/2 = v dspl 2/2</formula><p>+ , which causes the retailer to abandon the outside SB supply (see Figure <ref type="figure">3(d)</ref>).</p><p>In part (iii) of Proposition 2, the NBM is in the worst possible position because both his differentiation ability and his cost advantage are low.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Throw in the Towel (Accommodate) or Fight</head><p>Back (Augment)? In § §5.1 and 5.2 we examined the equilibrium product positioning and prices when the NBM chooses to either accommodate or augment when fully anticipating the retailer's strategic behavior. Now we turn to Stage 1 of the game, where the NBM decides whether to accommodate or augment, and if latter, how.</p><p>Given the range of the fixed cost, F , we have ruled out the possibility that the NBM would design more than two products in the absence of an SB competitive threat. Based on our assumption about we have also ruled out the case where the NBM would supply a second product whose quality is lower than the SB's. Therefore the NBM is left with two basic options (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): "throw in the towel" by offering one NB product that accommodates the SB or "fight back" by offering a second NB product that either buffers or displaces the SB.

Hence, it is not obvious that inequality (8) can hold in the presence of the SB. The intriguing question is, if it is never optimal for the monopolist NBM to launch a second product, why would it be optimal when the NBM is in a worse competitive situation? <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The next proposition answers the question as to when the NBM would decide to fight with additional products and why.</p><p>Proposition 3. Suppose the NBM competes with the SB and F ≤ F ≤F (cf. Proposition 1).</p><p>1. If the NBM's cost advantage is low ( is below some¯ ), then the NBM accommodates the SB. The value of the critical¯ depends on the NBM's differentiation ability, i.e., whether ∈ A L or ∈ A H . We denote these critical values as bffr acmd and dspl acmd . 2. If the NBM's cost advantage is high, two outcomes are possible. The NBM buffers by introducing a second product when his differentiation ability is high and &gt; bffr acmd . The retailer introduces the outside supplier's product as an SB, and there are three products in the market. When the NBM's differentiation ability is low and &gt; dspl acmd , the NBM produces a second product that displaces the outside supplier's product. The retailer rationally decides to abandon the outside supplier.</p><p>Proposition 3 identifies the two important strategic insights: (1) when the NBM will shun product strategy and rely only on price (accommodate) and (2) when, conditional on augmentation, the NBM will decide to buffer or displace. Interestingly, Proposition 3 points out the interaction effect of and on the NBM's strategic decision when is high. In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we show the final equilibrium graphically. 5.3.1. Accommodate vs. Augment. For low values of , the NBM accommodates the SB entry and forgoes the expansion of the product line through a second product. To see the intuition for why this equilibrium would survive, consider what would happen if the NBM were to offer a second product when is low. Remember that the strategic trade-off between accommodation and augmentation for NBM is the net effect of increased profits (demand expansion minus cannibalization minus F ). Now, a low value of = w − implies that the outside SB marginal cost is reasonably close to . When the NBM's ability to differentiate is high ( is low), then w is correspondingly low, and two forces are at work: (i) the NBM can create enough spacing in the quality space between its products (low ) to create market expansion for himself, and (ii) a low value of w leads the retailer to price the SB aggressively close to the defender product, leading not only to erosion in the margin for the defender but threatening cannibalization with the premium NB, which would lead to erosion in the margin of the premium NB. The combined effect is that the net incremental profit for the NBM is not sufficient to overcome F .</p><p>When the NBM's ability to differentiate is low (high ) and w is correspondingly high, the calculus changes. High implies that ramping up quality is very costly, which further implies that ramping up high quality to entice the high consumers is difficult because the marginal cost of quality is increasing more rapidly compared with the consumers' marginal willingness to pay for quality. This means it is more difficult for the NBM to create enough spacing between his products in the quality space. This would lead to a lesser expansion effect for the NBM, with severe cannibalization not because of aggressive pricing at the lower end but because of the closeness of the NB products in the quality space. Once again, the incremental profit does not compensate for F , and the NBM forsakes the introduction of the second product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2.">Buffer vs. Displace.</head><p>We now turn to the case when the NBM enjoys a significant cost advantage (high ). This means the SB cost is high relative to the marginal cost of the NBM. When the NBM's ability to differentiate is also high (low ), it is the best of both worlds for the NBM. Because of his differentiation ability, he can create two products and create enough spacing between them to enhance the market expansion effect. Because of the cost advantage, he does not have to worry about severe margin erosion at the low end that could exacerbate the threat of cannibalization.</p><p>To create enough separation between his products, the NBM chooses a high-quality defender and prices it so that w 2/2 &gt; v 2/2 + , which causes the retailer to retain the outside SB (see §5.2). However, to take more sales away from the SB than from the premium NB, the NBM must differentiate his premium NB and his second (defender) product more than in the monopoly case. This is seen graphically in Figure <ref type="figure">4(c</ref>). The corresponding demands are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(d). (In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(b), note that 0 &lt; v bffr 1/2 − v bffr 1/2 &lt; v bsln2 1/2 − v bsln2 1/2 .</formula><p>) In particular, compared with the monopoly case, the NBM distorts the quality of the premium NB upwards and the quality of the defender downwards. This positioning strategy leads the NBM to experience much less cannibalization (SC, −) in the competitive case than in the monopoly case (see the SC curve in <ref type="bibr">Figure 5(a)</ref>)-so much less that, for high values of , the marginal profit of the defender product becomes large enough to offset the fixed cost hurdle F . This is why the NBM can sustain the buffering strategy in the final equilibrium. Of course, in the absence of the SB threat, the NBM would optimally revert to the single-product strategy, which demonstrates that the </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">d 1/1 bsln1 d 1/2 dspl dspl = d 2/2 d 1/2 acmd d 1/1 acmd d 1/2 dspl d 2/2 dspl d s Accommodate Displace (c) Qualities at low v 1/1 bsln1 v 1/2 bffr v 1/1 acmd v 2/2 bffr v s Accommodate Buffer (d) Demand at low d 1/1 bsln1 d 1/2 bffr = d 2/2 bffr d s d s Accommodate Buffer</formula><p>net marginal profit the NBM can gain from introducing an additional product can be higher under competition than under monopoly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Empirical and Managerial Implications</head><p>In this section, using our equilibrium results and the associated conditions, we circle back to the motivating examples presented in §1. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the regions within the − space where each of the NBM's product line strategies dominates. As an example of successful buffering, we use 3M's Highland version of Post-it notes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ritson 2009</ref>). Post-it notes, the premium NB, were invented by 3M and are somewhat unique because of the adhesive used, which was under patent protection until late 1990s. We can conjecture that 3M's adhesives would be difficult to imitate by fringe producers, which would be consistent with high . The premium NB also continues to evolve, which would be consistent with low . For example, in 2003, the company came out with an updated version of Post-it notes that could adhere to vertical and nonsmooth surfaces. Compatible with our results, 3M buffers its premium NB with a lower-priced version called Highland, which uses a lower-grade paper and lower-grade adhesive.</p><p>The second example is from a large consumer packaged goods manufacturer in the adult incontinence category. The firm has been a virtual monopolist with very little competition except from a few small manufacturers offering regional brands. Recently, it faced strong competition from SBs with such aggressive entry strategies that its market share began a steady decline. To combat this, the firm innovated and introduced a higher-quality product with a higher value point and price. The firm labeled this a "trade-up strategy." This high-quality product was launched; meanwhile, the firm kept its old NB as a buffer between its new high-quality product and the SBs. Within three quarters of the new product launch, the combined market share for the firm was higher than it was with the single NB because the market, in turn, expanded. When asked why the firm does not offer an SB itself, a manager, who presented the case, replied, "Our plant and equipment costs are high due to the better technology that affords manufacturing bigger lots and higher quality." Although the model in this paper is a static game, this example clearly illustrates that the equilibrium that we advance seems to mirror the facts of this case as they unfolded in this category.</p><p>It would be useful to collect more systematic data and interview more managers to offer stronger empirical support than what we are able to offer through these anecdotal examples.</p><p>In §1, we chose Alcoa as an example of an NBM that uses the displacement strategy. Alcoa is the world's leading producer of aluminum foil, a commodity-like product whose production requires a substantial investment in heavy infrastructure. (Aluminum foil is produced in large mills by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten aluminum.) We can conjecture that aluminum foil is consistent with high (i.e., it is an NB product that is difficult to improve through product innovation) and high (i.e., it is a product that is difficult for a smaller fringe producer to make more efficiently). Consistent with our prediction in Proposition 3, in many stores nationwide, Alcoa displaces outside SB producers by becoming the SB supplier.</p><p>Finally, examples of accommodation from practice include Coke and Pepsi, which in the 1980s refused to supply Canadian grocers with an SB soft drink <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dunne and Narasimhan 1999)</ref>. The grocers found another source, Cott Corporation, which became a considerable threat to the two big cola makers. We can conjecture that SB soft drinks are easy to produce (after all, even at home, it is possible to very inexpensively produce a wide variety of soft drinks using supplies sold by companies such as SodaStream). Therefore SB soft drinks would be consistent with low in our model and, consistent with Proposition 3, both Coke and Pepsi would optimally accommodate them. For more definitive links to industry practices, however, it would be interesting to validate our model empirically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Extension to Multiple Retailers</head><p>One important issue to consider is that in many markets NBMs sell through multiple retailers. 9 Modeling multiple retailers would undoubtedly introduce some additional trade-offs. Suppose the NBM sells through two independent retailers-say, R1 and R2who serve two distinct nonoverlapping markets. If the retailers are symmetric, then it is straightforward to show that the NBM can achieve the outcome presented in §5.3. Now, suppose the retailers are asymmetric. Suppose R1 can acquire the SB at the same cost that the NBM incurs to make it; i.e., 1 = 0. R2 can only acquire the SB at a higher price than the NBM's cost of producing it, implying 0 &lt; 2 . In this case, an NBM with low is still able to achieve the outcome presented in §5.3. In particular, if an NBM with low finds it optimal to buffer (offer a defender that does not displace the SB with high ), both R1 and R2 optimally carry the SB, the defender, and the premium NB. More interestingly, if an NBM with high sells through asymmetric retailers, then the next proposition shows that the two retailers will differ in their choice of which products to carry. Proposition 4. Suppose the NBM sells his products through two independent retailers as outlined above.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The introduction and presence of SBs in the United States and in other developed countries is an important strategic concern to NBMs. Over the past decade, annual sales of SB products have increased by 40% in supermarkets and by 96% in drug stores <ref type="bibr">(Private Label Manufacturers Association 2011)</ref>. It is therefore important to study how an NBM should respond to a potential threat of an SB entry. Specifically, we look at the following questions.</p><p>1. Should an NBM compete against the threat of an SB just with price and price promotions? For example, the 2010 PLMA data show extreme efforts made by NBMs (e.g., elevated promotional spending, shortterm price cuts) to recapture market share lost to SBs in previous years (see <ref type="bibr">Private Label Manufacturers Association 2011)</ref>.</p><p>2. Should the NBM defend his position by innovative product line expansion? If so, how exactly should he position his offerings when faced with the threat of an SB?</p><p>To answer these questions, we construct a gametheoretic model of an NBM, a retailer, and a competitive fringe market and examine the equilibrium product qualities and prices that would prevail in this market. To make relevant comparisons, we considered a range of parameter space where the NBM introduces only one product in the absence of the SB. Past research has shown that incumbent NBMs could accommodate SBs by lowering their wholesale prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Narasimhan and Wilcox 1998)</ref> and includes conditions under which NBMs would optimally become SB suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Kumar et al. 2010</ref>. Building on this literature, we fully explore the conditions under which the NBM will accommodate the SB by changing the price of his existing product only, how and when he might fight back with his own products, and when he will become the supplier of the SB. By examining two key drivers-cost advantage and the ability to differentiate relative to the competitive fringe-we show that product positioning strategies are an important component of the NBM's competitive response. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Our main results, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, are as follows.</p><p>1. Whether and how to fight back hinges on the above-mentioned key drivers and the interplay between them. Cost advantage is key to product line expansion, and the choice of positioning strategy is dictated by the relative ability to differentiate.</p><p>2. When the cost advantage relative to outside SB suppliers is low, the NBM typically accommodates the entry of the SB but changes his wholesale price and improves the quality of his existing product. The market expands, and while the SB gains, the NB loses profits relative to the case when there is no SB.</p><p>3. When the NBM enjoys a significant cost advantage over the competitive fringe, he competes with Marketing Science 32(4), pp. 591-608, © 2013 INFORMS new products. At high levels of the ability to differentiate, the NBM introduces a defender positioned between his premium brand and the SB. We refer to this as buffering. At low levels of differentiation ability, the NBM takes over the supply of the SB, and we call this displacing. In this case the retailer rationally abandons the pursuit of the competitive fringe. Interestingly, under some conditions, the NBM supplies a premium private label as the SB, consistent with what has been said about retailer demands.</p><p>4. Introduction of an SB of lower quality than that of the incumbent NB leads to an expansion of the market and lower average retail price. The retailer always benefits from the potential to introduce an SB.</p><p>In our model development, we assumed that the NBM has foresight and correctly anticipates the retailer's choice for the SB in designing the qualities of the NB product line. If an NBM has attained a strong position for some time prior to the anticipated introduction of the SB, the cost of repositioning or improving the quality of the NB may be too high for the NBM. However, if we restrict the NB quality to be the same, even after entry of an SB, all our results still hold; of course, the price levels and profits would be different in the different regimes. The quality of the defender product would be lower than the equilibrium quality with foresight.</p><p>The analysis presented in this paper can be generalized in several ways. First, we assumed that the taste parameter, , in our utility function is uniformly distributed across the population. Suppose a firm conducts marketing research and estimates the heterogeneity distribution. One can then use that distribution to model heterogeneity and solve the game. Second, future research may include retail competition in the model and examine the role of SBs as a means of store differentiation rather than as a way to serve low-valuation customers. Finally, future research may also examine the role of retailerspecific factors such as assortment cost and shelf space constraints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Baseline Case</head><p>Proof of Proposition 1. First we analyze the retailer's product and pricing decisions when she is offered N &gt; 0 products. The product qualities are v 1 v 2 v N : v n+1 &lt; v n ∀ n ∈ 1 N , and the wholesale prices are w 1 w 2 w N . Let n n+1 = p n−1 − p n / v n−1 − v n denote the consumer type who is indifferent between products n and n + 1. Hence, demand for an arbitrary product n expressed as a function of retail price and quality is given by</p><p>The demand function of any arbitrary product n is kinked since the retailer can drop it by setting its retail price sufficiently high to drive its demand to 0. This is easy to see as</p><p>i.e., the interval of types that prefer product n over n + 1 and n − 1 is empty. The types are bounded by 1 from the top; this is equivalent to the existence of a product,</p><p>The option of not buying is equivalent to the existence of a product, n = N + 1, such that p N +1 = 0 and v N +1 = 0.</p><p>To examine whether the retailer decides to carry an arbitrary product, we start by assuming that she carries all N products, and we derive conditions under which she prefers not to drop an arbitrary product n. From (A1) and (2), the product n equilibrium retail price is 12</p><p>Substituting for p n in (A1) yields demand for product n as a function of w n and v n :</p><p>To account for the upper bound on and the outside option, we define w 0 ≡ p 0 + p 1 − v 1 and v 0 ≡ w 0 + 2v 1 − 2p 1 .</p><p>Lemma 1. Suppose there are N products available to the retailer with qualities v 1 v 2 v N v n+1 &lt; v n ∀ n ∈ 1 N and wholesale prices w 1 w 2 w N . A profit-maximizing retailer decides to carry product n whenever</p><p>Proof of Lemma 1. Using (A4), d n w n &gt; 0. Moreover, (A2) implies p n &gt; w n .
