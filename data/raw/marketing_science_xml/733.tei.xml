<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W hile retailers have sales data to forecast demand, manufacturers have a broad understanding of the market and the coming trends. It is well known that pooling such demand information within a distribution channel improves supply chain logistics. However, little is known about how information-sharing affects wholesale pricing incentives. In this paper, we investigate a channel structure where a manufacturer and two retailers have private signals of the state of the demand. Our model identifies the presence of a pricing distortion, which we term the inference effect, when a manufacturer sets price to an uninformed retailer. Because of this inference effect, the manufacturer would like to set a low wholesale price to signal to the retailer that the demand is low. On the other hand, the manufacturer would like to set a high wholesale price so that he earns the optimal margin on each unit sold. Vertical information sharing benefits the manufacturer by eliminating the distortion caused by the inference effect, which is more profound in a channel whose retailer has a noisier signal. This result implies that when there is a cost associated with transmitting information, the manufacturer may choose to share information with only the less-informed retailer rather than with both.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There has been a great deal of attention in supply chain management on information-sharing initiatives. Initiatives, such as Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR), involve the exchange of information among members of the distribution channel to improve supply chain efficiency. Much of the data that is shared concerns the state of consumer demand and is used by suppliers and retailers to improve forecasts and distribution planning. While much has been written about the logistic benefits for vertical information sharing, little attention has been paid to the strategic benefits. In this paper, we examine how pricing strategies are affected by the sharing of demand information within a distribution channel.</p><p>In an early application of CPFR, Warner-Lambert, makers of Listerine mouthwash, and Wal-Mart agreed to share demand forecasts six months in advance of the expected retail sale date with the intent to improve order accuracy and production planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Seifert 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Småros 2003</ref>. The benefit commonly attributed to this and other similar initiatives 1 is a 1 Others include Continuous Replenishment Program and Efficient Consumer Response. more streamlined supply chain, which reduces inventories and lowers operating costs for all members of the supply chain. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In this case, Listerine's production scheduling was considerably smoother while Wal-Mart improved its in-stock position from 85% to 98% <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Seifert 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Such logistic benefits are now well known for pooling demand forecasts in a supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lee et al. 1997)</ref>. In this research, we acknowledge these motivations and ask the next question: How does sharing information within a distribution channel affect a manufacturer's pricing incentives? We take as given that a smoother supply chain can lower operational costs and allow a manufacturer to price more competitively. However, when controlling for these cost savings, our research shows that by sharing demand information with a retailer, a manufacturer may benefit additionally from higher wholesale prices.</p><p>The magnitude of this benefit for the manufacturer depends greatly on the characteristics of the distribution channel. Given that Warner-Lambert entered Gal-Or, Geylani, and Dukes: Information Sharing in a Channel with Partially Informed Retailers Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 642-658, © 2008 INFORMS 643 into a sharing arrangement with the largest retailer in the world, it may also be tempting to reason that this potential benefit is largest with large retailers. Our model, however, indicates that this reasoning may not always hold. To illustrate, consider the following.</p><p>Apparel manufacturer VF, snack producer Nabisco, and Delta Faucet are other examples of suppliers who have benefited by implementing information exchange systems with the retailers who distribute their products. But, contrary to the example above, these suppliers did not initiate their informationsharing arrangements with dominant, power retailers like Wal-Mart, Target or Home Depot. Rather, they started exclusively with the smaller specialty retailers ShopKo, Wegmans, and TrueValue Hardware, respectively. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> This research investigates reasons why a manufacturer may, in some cases, find it optimal to exchange demand information with its low-volume retailer instead of sharing with a large-scale big-box retailer.</p><p>Our results rely on the notion that manufacturers and retailers all have different kinds of demand information. Retailers, for instance, have point-of-sale (POS) data, knowledge of their own merchandising efforts, and aggregate store measures. Moreover, the precision of this information may differ across retailers depending on the retailers' size and location. Manufacturers, on the other hand, often have broader information about the market, consumer motivations, demographic patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Desrochers et al. 2003)</ref>, and study the factors that affect sales of their own products <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blattberg and Fox 1995)</ref>.</p><p>We interpret these data sources as providing the respective channel member a private signal about the state of demand. When information-sharing arrangements have been implemented, these signals can be pooled, yielding more accurate demand forecasts. But even when information-sharing arrangements have not been established, strategic choices permit inferences about other channel members' signals. We illustrate, specifically, that a retailer may infer the manufacturer's knowledge about demand through wholesale prices. A high wholesale price, for instance, tells the retailer that the manufacturer expects high demand. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The retailer's ability to use wholesale price to infer the manufacturer's signal complicates the pricing problem facing the manufacturer. In particular, the retailer is more sensitive to (wholesale) price in the absence of information sharing. Thus the manufacturer, faced with the familiar channel inefficiencies of double marginalization, is induced to distort its wholesale price downward relative to the case with no demand uncertainty. We refer to the phenomenon that induces this distortion as the inference effect. The distortion is alleviated, however, when the manufacturer can directly communicate its signal to the retailer. We conclude that alleviating the adverse consequences of the inference effect is an incentive for a manufacturer to implement information-sharing arrangements with a retailer.</p><p>The magnitude of the inference effect, and, consequently, the benefit of vertical information sharing, depends on several factors. The degree of retail competition, the relative precision of a retailer's stochastic signal, and whether competing retailers are already sharing demand signals are three important factors determining the benefits of vertical information sharing, which are explored in this research.</p><p>First, we investigate how the general competitive environment in which a retailer operates affects the impact of the inference effect. We might expect, for example, the inference effect to differ between a competitive discounter and a specialty niche retailer. As mentioned above, the inference effect stems from channel inefficiencies associated with double marginalization, and such inefficiencies are known to be less severe when retailers face strong competition. Consequently, our results suggest that a manufacturer may benefit more by sharing its information with retailers in less competitive environments.</p><p>Second, the relative precision of retailers' demand signal directly affects the size of the inference effect. Volume of sales plays an important role in the accuracy of retailer information. Some retailers, because of their larger market share, have access to larger amounts of POS data than the others. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In addition, a retailer's investment in information technologies (ITs) is an important factor in determining the precision of that information. This paper shows that the adverse consequences of the inference effect are more pronounced for a channel in which the retailer has less precise information because the retailer is likely to rely more heavily on wholesale price for inferences about the state of demand. Thus, sharing information in these channels offers relatively more benefits than in channels with more accurate information.</p><p>Finally, we evaluate how the information possessed by one retailer affects the magnitude of the inference effect in a competing retail channel. We ask, for Marketing Science 27(4), pp. <ref type="bibr">642-658, © 2008 INFORMS</ref> example, what is the manufacturer's benefit of sharing information with Wal-Mart given that it is already sharing information with Wal-Mart's competitor. Our model suggests that there may be diminishing returns to developing information-sharing arrangements with additional retailers. The implication of this result is that even if the cost of developing an informationsharing network stays constant, the payoff from this investment may depend on the number of channels with such a network already installed.</p><p>There are significant costs associated with implementing information-sharing arrangements in a given distribution channel. Despite the fact that the marginal cost of information transmission is virtually zero, there may also be large setup costs in building and developing communication technologies, solving incompatibility of IT systems between partners, buying forecast software, and training personnel. This implies that, despite the noted benefits of vertical information sharing, implementing a sharing arrangement in a given channel is not optimal unless the benefits exceed costs. While the investment in one channel may have spillover benefits in another, many of these costs are channel specific. Therefore, just because a manufacturer finds information sharing optimal in one channel, does not automatically mean it is optimal in a second. This cost structure implies that it is possible to see a manufacturer exchange demand information in selected retail channels, but not in all. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Though the initial analysis focuses on one-sided information sharing-from the manufacturer to a retailer-supply chain collaboration in practice usually involves sharing information in both directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Min et al. 2005)</ref>. The lessons from the one-sided analysis serve as a benchmark for the subsequent analysis of two-sided sharing in which information is transmitted not only from a manufacturer to a retailer, but also from a retailer to a manufacturer. As indicated above, alleviation of the inference effect is most beneficial when a retailer has a relatively imprecise signal of demand. With two-sided sharing, the manufacturer would receive poorer information in return than if it had shared with the better-informed retailer. We provide conditions indicating when and with which retailer(s) the manufacturer gains the most benefit from a two-sided information-sharing arrangement. Then, we use the results of this analysis to derive testable hypotheses to determine whether alleviating the adverse consequences of the inference effect may <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Of course, market conditions are constantly changing through time, and the manufacturer-retailer collaborations mentioned earlier later evolve to include other retailers. What is relevant for our objective is to explain why manufacturers might make exclusive information-sharing arrangements with less-informed retailers in some, but not all, instances. provide an incentive for the manufacturers to share their information.</p><p>The subject of information sharing has attracted the interest of many academics in different fields. In marketing, Villas-Boas (1994) examines whether competing firms should share the same advertising agency, which can make a firm's private information available to competitors. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In accounting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Radhakrishnan and Srinidhi (2005)</ref> study the implication of channel members' bargaining power on the implementation of information exchange (IE) arrangements. In economics, there is a literature on information sharing in oligopoly. This research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Novshek and Sonnenschein 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Vives 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Gal-Or 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Li 1985</ref> investigates information-sharing incentives of firms engaged in horizontal competition. We distinguish our work from these by the fact that we investigate the incentive for information sharing in a distribution channel that involves vertical relations. Another strand of literature in economics that is directly related to our analysis is the literature on signaling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Spence 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Milgrom and Roberts 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Gal-Or 1987</ref>. Similar to the inference effect that arises in our analysis, in this literature, as well, the absence of direct communication among asymmetrically informed parties leads to distortions in their behavior.</p><p>As mentioned previously, there have been a number of studies on information sharing in the supply chain management literature, which identify benefits relating to improving logistics, alleviating order batching, and inventory shortages (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gavirneni et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Cachon and Fisher 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Lee et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Raghunathan 2001</ref>). However, these papers primarily use channel structures, in which there is no horizontal competition between the retailers, and information transmission is only from the retailer to the manufacturer. In addition, we focus on the role demand uncertainty plays in the pricing decisions of the manufacturer.</p><p>A relevant paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li (2002)</ref>, incorporates horizontal competition to a vertical information-sharing model to examine the leakage effect of information sharing. This effect is caused by the reaction of competitors that are not involved in information sharing. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li's (2002)</ref> research as well, the downstream retailer transmits its information to the upstream supplier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">He et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Niraj and Narasimhan (2002)</ref>, on the other hand, investigate information transmission not only from the retailer to the manufacturer, but also from the manufacturer to the retailer. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">He et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Niraj and Narasimhan (2002)</ref> do not allow the retailers to infer the manufacturer's private information from the wholesale price, and are thus unable to detect the channel distortions caused by the inference effect.</p><p>Our work is also similar in spirit to the growing literature on asymmetric channel structures. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dukes et al. (2006)</ref> consider retailers that are asymmetric in terms of their retailing costs. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Geylani et al. (2007)</ref>, the asymmetry is in retailers' differential ability to dictate their terms to the upstream supplier, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raju and Zhang (2005)</ref>, it is in price leadership. In the channel structure analyzed here, on the other hand, retailers differ in the quality of their demand signals.</p><p>As with much of the marketing literature on channels, our research relates to the manufacturer's use of strategies to coordinate channel efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Caldieraro and Coughlan (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jeuland and Shugan (1983)</ref>, for instance, examine the use of sales force incentives and wholesale pricing contracts, respectively, as a means to reduce channel inefficiencies, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Luo et al. (2007)</ref> proposes an approach to new product development that aligns channel interests. The manufacturer in our setting, by contrast, is concerned with the impact of demand information on channel decisions.</p><p>Subsequent sections are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the basic modeling framework. Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium in a channel where a manufacturer considers transmitting his demand information to two asymmetrically informed retailers. Section 4 extends this model to incorporate bilateral information exchange. Section 5 proposes two hypotheses to test whether alleviation of the inference effect is a benefit from vertical information sharing, and §6 includes concluding remarks and extensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Modeling Framework</head><p>Consider a channel with two retailers who compete in the sale of a single product that is supplied by a manufacturer. Without loss of generality, assume that marginal costs for both the manufacturer and the retailers are zero. The retailers are symmetric in every aspect except the accuracy of their private information about the state of the demand. We make this assumption to focus solely on the implication of asymmetry in the accuracy of information of the retailers on the manufacturer's incentives to share information. Similar to the retailers, the manufacturer also has access to private information about the Manufacturer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 0 x 0 = u + ε 0 , ε 0~N (0, s 0 ) Retailer 1: x 1 x 1 = u + ε 1 , ε 1~N (0, s 1 ) p w Retailer 2: x 2 x 2 = u + ε 2 , ε 2~N (0, s 2 ) cov(ε 0 , ε 1 ) = cov(ε 1 , ε 2 ) = cov(ε 0 , ε 2 ) = 0 cov(ε 0 , u) = cov(ε 1 , u) = cov(ε 0 , u) = 0 p w</formula><p>state of the demand. This information may be shared within the channel and this decision is strategically made by the manufacturer.</p><p>We further assume that the manufacturer offers a uniform wholesale price p w to both retailers. Following the manufacturer's wholesale pricing decision, the retailers i = 1 2 compete on retail prices p i . Each retailer faces the following linear stochastic demand:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q i = a b + d − bp i b 2 − d 2 + dp j b 2 − d 2 + u i = j a &gt; 0 and b &gt; d &gt; 0 (1)</formula><p>where u is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance . <ref type="bibr">8</ref> All the channel members observe noisy signals of u. The signal observed by the manufacturer is x 0 and by the retailers are x 1 and x 2 . Specifically, for i = 0 1 2, we assume x i = u + i , (u 0 1 2 ∼ N 0 ), where = diag s 0 s 1 s 2 . Notice that in this formulation, the noise in a signal is captured by s i . The better-informed i is the smaller s i is. We assume s i i = 0 1 2 and to be known by all the channel members. The model's information structure is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. 9 8 This is an equivalent form of q i = − p i + p j + u, with &gt; 0 and &gt; &gt; 0. We use the demand function given in (1) because of its nice boundary cases of no differentiation and local monopolies when d = b and d = 0, respectively. The direct demand functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q i = a/ b + d − bp i / b 2 − d 2 + dp j / b 2 − d 2 are equivalent to the sys- tem of inverse demand functions p i = a − bq i − dq j i j = 1 2 i = j.</formula><p>Note that when d = 0, the inverse demand reduces to p i = a − bq i , which is the schedule facing a monopolist. Hence, d = 0 can be interpreted as maximum differentiation between retailers. In contrast, when d = b, the inverse demand reduces to p i = a − b q i + q j , implying that the price of i declines at the same rate irrespective of whether retailer i or j expands its physical sales. Hence, d = b corresponds to no differentiation between the retailers. The sequence of events and decisions are as follows. First, the manufacturer decides whether and with which retailer to share information. This decision involves investment in the infrastructure necessary to support the sharing of information with the selected retailers. This infrastructure may include ITs and personnel dedicated to the interaction with the retailers. Subsequent to the information-sharing decision, nature determines the demand signals x 0 , x 1 , and x 2 and channel members observe a subset of these realizations. Second, the manufacturer and retailers observe their private signals and any signals which they are privy to as determined by the informationsharing arrangement made in the first stage. Third, after signal realizations have been observed, the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Last, the retailers choose their prices. The timing of this game is graphically depicted as a four-stage process in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>We distinguish between two types of informationsharing arrangements: one sided and two sided. With one-sided sharing, information is transmitted only from the manufacturer to the retailer. Specifically, onesided information sharing implies that a retailer is informed of the manufacturer's private signal x 0 . In §3, we develop the model in the case of one-sided information. Later, in §4, we extend the analysis to two-sided information sharing where information is transmitted not only from the manufacturer to the retailer, but also from the retailer to the manufacturer. Thus, in the two-sided case, a decision to share information with retailer i implies that the manufacturer and retailer i both observe x 0 and x i in stage 2. The timing depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> reflects the fact that the installation of communication infrastructure is a long-term decision, relative to pricing. The manufacturer must, therefore, commit to its informationsharing policy before observing its own signal. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In addition, the assumed timing implies the manufacturer can adjust its wholesale price p w contingent on the demand signal x 0 that it observes. It follows that a retailer can draw inferences about the realization of the demand signal based on the observation of p w , by our model will be present as long as there is positive correlation between the individual market disturbances (0 &lt; u 1 u 2 &lt; 1). See the Technical Appendix at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org. even when the manufacturer chooses not to communicate directly with the retailer. In our analysis, we demonstrate that such indirect inferences hurt the manufacturer in comparison to an environment where he can commit to directly communicate in a truthful manner with the retailer.</p><p>Each agent in the model bases its pricing decision on its own observed signal, those learned through information sharing, and in the case of the retailers, on the manufacturer's wholesale price. We thus define a decision rule for each agent as a mapping f i i = 0 1 2 from the space of possible signal values and, in the case of retailers, possible wholesale prices. Specifically, the manufacturer's decision rule specifies the wholesale price using p w = f 0 x 0 , where x 0 = x 0 is a vector of observed signals, which always includes the signal x 0 . In the case of two-sided information sharing, x 0 possibly includes retailers' signals. Retailer i's decision rule specifies a retail price p i = f i x i p w , i = 1 2, where x i = x i is a vector of observed signals, which always includes the signal x i and possibly x 0 in the case of information sharing.</p><p>As we show in the Technical Appendix at http:// mktsci.pubs.informs.org, normality of the random variables combined with the assumption of linear demand implies that we can restrict our attention to linear decision rules, without loss of generality. 11 That is, in our analysis, we assume that each agent's decision rule f • is a linear function of its arguments and reflects optimal choices. The exact form of this linear function is then determined matching it with equilibrium conditions of the particular game under consideration. Furthermore, we are assured that this process leads to the unique Bayesian-Nash equilibrium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">One-Sided Information Sharing</head><p>In this section, we investigate one-sided communication. When the manufacturer decides to share its information, it is transmitted from the manufacturer to one or both of the retailers. Two-sided information sharing is considered later in §4. The analysis can be broken up by considering the four possible scenarios, or subgames, that are possible after the manufacturer's information-sharing decision in stage 1. In the No-Sharing (NS) game, the manufacturer does not reveal its private signal to either retailer. If the manufacturer decides to share this signal with retailer i = 1 or 2, exclusively, then the parties play a Partial Sharing (PSi) game. Finally, it may share the signal with both retailers in which case we are in the Full Sharing (FS) game.</p><p>As will be shown, an uninformed retailer's use of wholesale price to infer the manufacturer's private signal on demand plays an important role in the choice of wholesale price, and, consequently, for the incentives to share information. The role this inference plays can be illustrated by a careful analysis of the NS scenario. Consider the subgame following the manufacturer's decision in stage 1 not to reveal his private signal to either retailer. We analyze this subgame by solving the pricing decisions of the retailers (fourth stage) first and then the wholesale pricing decision of the manufacturer (third stage), given that the manufacturer decides not to share its information in the first stage. As discussed above, we can restrict attention to linear decision rules.</p><p>At the fourth stage, retailer i, i = 1 2 knows its own signal and is able to use the manufacturer's wholesale price to infer something about the state of demand. Thus the retailer uses its decision rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p i = f i x i p w = D i 0 + D i 1 x i + D i 2 p w (2)</formula><p>to set the price. The coefficients D i k , k = 0 1 2 must be consistent with equilibrium in the NS. Thus the price p i must maximize</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E i x i p w = a b + d − bp i b 2 − d 2 + dE p j x i p w b 2 − d 2 + E u x i p w p i − p w (3)</formula><p>where retailer i's expectations of its rival retailer's price and of the demand parameter u have been inserted in the expression for expected demand. Retailer i's first-order condition (FOC) with respect to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p i implies p i = a b −d +dE p j x i p w + b 2 −d 2 E u x i p w +bp w 2b i = 1 2 i = j (4)</formula><p>Retailer i uses retailer j's decision rule to form expectation about its price</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">E p j x i p w = D j 0 + D j 1 E x j x i p w + D j 2 p w (5)</formula><p>To make an inference on the stochastic demand term, recall that retailer i uses not only its own signal, but the manufacturer's signal as inferred by his price p w . That is, retailer i can, itself, evaluate the manufacturer's decision rule, which has the assumed form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p w = f 0 x 0 = 0 + x 0 (6)</formula><p>by solving for x 0 if = 0. 12 Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) implies that the retailers can perfectly infer x 0 from the wholesale price p w , since it is only the manufacturer's demand signal that affects its pricing. When the pricing of the manufacturer depends on additional supply-side uncertainties, the retailers would not be able to draw perfect inferences about x 0 based on the observation of p w . <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We make the simplifying assumption that only demand uncertainties lead to fluctuations in p w to highlight the above-mentioned inference effect.</p><p>We discuss the implications of relaxing this assumption in §6. Knowledge of the realizations of both x 0 and x i imply (DeGroot 1970, pp. 51-55)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">E u x i x 0 = E x j x i x 0 = s 0 x i + s i x 0 s i + s 0 + s i s 0 (7)</formula><p>Inserting ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E u x i p w = E x j x i p w = s 0 x i + s i p w − 0 / s i + s 0 + s i s 0 (8)</formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) accounts for the fact that despite no information sharing, retailers can perfectly infer the manufacturer's private signal by inverting the manufacturer's optimization problem. In addition, it says that the manufacturer can influence retailers' assessment of the demand parameter u in its choice of p w . In particular, if &gt; 0, then the statistical updating rule in (8) implies that retailers infer a higher state of demand the higher wholesale price is. Equations ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), (4), and (5) yield six equations, which can be solved for the six unknown parameters D i k , k = 0 1 2 for i = 1 2, where the hatted notation corresponds to the retailer's optimal decision rule. The optimal D's are functions of exogenous demand parameters a b d, the distribution parameters s 0 , s 1 , s 2 , and , and the coefficients 0 and of the manufacturer's pricing decision rule. The algebraic details of this solution offer little insight and are thus relegated to the appendix (in proof of Lemma A.1).</p><p>At the second stage, the manufacturer chooses its pricing decision rule using the decision rules of the retailers derived above to maximize expected profits conditional on its own signal E m x 0 = E q i + q j p w x 0 which can be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E m x 0 = 2a − E p i x 0 − E p j x 0 b + d + 2E u x 0 p w = 2a − D i 0 + D i 1 E x i x 0 + D i 2 p w − D j 0 + D j 1 E x j x 0 + D j 2 p w • b + d −1 + 2E u x 0 p w (9)</formula><p>The manufacturer's expectations of retailers' decision rules for prices have been substituted into the respective demand Equations (1). The expected profit function, expressed above, reveals an adverse incentive for manufacturer's wholesale pricing decision. To see this, first note that because the manufacturer cannot use nonlinear pricing rules, it is faced with the familiar channel distortions of double marginalization. Second, each retailer uses wholesale price to statistically assess the state of demand. As previously discussed, a higher p w indicates a higher state of demand (through retailers' inference on u). 14 Therefore, because of an inference effect, the marginal effect of wholesale price on output (retail sales) is exaggerated. In this sense, asymmetric information exacerbates channel inefficiencies associated with double marginalization.</p><p>To see this mathematically, observe in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) each retailer's reaction to p w . The coefficients D 1 2 , D 2 2 reflect the sensitivity of output with respect to wholesale price. In a model of no uncertainty, these coefficients are easily computed to be b/ 2b − d . However, with uncertainty and private information, D 1 2 D 2 2 &gt; b/ 2b − d , which reflects greater retailer sensitivity to wholesale price. Therefore the manufacturer's optimal wholesale price is lower than with full information. To put it differently, the manufacturer must distort p w downward to convey a lower state of demand and induce retailers to set lower retail prices. Note that in spite of the attempt of the manufacturer to convey information about a low state of demand, the retailers are never deceived. When the schedule of p w is strictly increasing, a separating equilibrium prevails, and there is a one-to-one mapping from x 0 to p w . Hence the retailers can perfectly infer the value of x 0 from the observation of p w . This suggests that the manufacturer may benefit if it could credibly commit to truthfully 15 revealing its private signal by means other than through the unit price, p w .</p><p>To determine the equilibrium wholesale price, we evaluate the optimization problem of the manufacturer. The FOC for the maximization of ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) with respect to p w leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p w = 1 2 D i 2 + D j 2 • 2a − D i 0 + D i 1 E x i x 0 − D j 0 + D j 1 E x j x 0 + 2 b + d E u x 0 (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where the manufacturer's expectations of retailers' signals can be expressed as follows <ref type="bibr">(DeGroot 1970, pp. 51-55)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E x i x 0 = E x j x 0 = E u x 0 = x 0 + s 0 (11)</formula><p>Intuitively, (11) expresses the manufacturer's posterior expectation of the retailers' signals. As the precision of its own signal improves (a decrease in s 0 ), its expectation of x i gets closer to its own signal. Using (10) to match the coefficients in (6) leads to two equations, which can be solved for the optimal and 0 in terms of exogenous demand and distribution parameters, details of which are omitted from the main text, but found in the appendix. The solution ( , 0 ), presented in Lemma 1, characterizes the manufacturer's optimal wholesale price conditional on the realization of x 0 in the NS game. Lemma 1 also presents the manufacturer's optimal wholesale price in the other information-sharing regimes.</p><p>In the partial information-sharing game, the manufacturer informs retailer i of its demand signal x 0 , but does not inform retailer j. In the third stage, the manufacturer chooses its decision rule p w using decision rules of the retailers and given his own signal to maximize E m x 0 . The main differences between the solution of this game and that of the NS game are in the conditional expectations and the linear decision rule retailer i uses. Instead of the conditional <ref type="bibr">15</ref> To make this commitment credible, the manufacturer may invest up front in costly infrastructure or personnel training that supports the collaboration with the retailers. However, this up front commitment is not necessarily monetary. It can be any action that binds the manufacturer to truthfully transmit its information. If, however, such credibility is not established, there is an incentive for the manufacturer to report untruthfully a signal lower than the true realization to further mitigate inefficiencies from double marginalization. (See Technical Appendix at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org.) expectations given in (8), retailer i estimates u directly from the manufacturer's signal using (7) rather than inferring it from the wholesale price p w . This softens the inference effect since retailer i's expectation E x j x i x 0 does not depend on wholesale price p w as in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>). Retailer j, on the other hand, has not been informed of x 0 and infers it from p w by inverting the manufacturer's decision rule as in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>). Hence the inference effect is present in the PSi game, but not to the extent as in the NS game.</p><p>Finally, in the FS game, the manufacturer shares x 0 with both retailers, so that retailers' inference about u are independent of p w . Therefore the inference effect is not present in the FS game. The following lemma summarizes the derivation of the manufacturer's decision rules in each NS, PSi, and FS games and illustrates the impact of information sharing on wholesale pricing.</p><p>Lemma 1. The wholesale price selected by the manufacturer in the first stage is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p w = y k a + b + d + s 0 x 0 for k = NS P Si F S</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">y NS ≡ 4bd +s 0 2 s i s j + s 0 +s 0 s i +s j • 2b 2 +bd +d 2 + 2 s 2 0 4b 2 −d 2 2 4b 2 i j −d 2 2 s 2 0 y PSi ≡      4b 2 −d 2 2 s 2 0 + +s 0 2 s i s j 2b 2 +bd +d 2 + 1 2b s 0 +s 0 8b 3 −2b 2 d +bd 2 +d 3 s i + 4b 3 +2b 2 d +2bd 2 s j      2 4b 2 i j −d 2 2 s 2 0 y F S = 1 2 i ≡ +s 0 s i + s 0</formula><p>It is directly shown that y F S &gt; y PSi &gt; y NS , implying that as the manufacturer increases the extent of information sharing with the retailers, it raises also the overall level of the wholesale prices that it charges. Hence the inference effect has adverse consequences for the manufacturer's ability to set a high price. In fact, the expected wholesale price is highest, E p w = a/2, when the manufacturer shares information with both retailers. Otherwise, whenever both or one of the retailers does not have access to x 0 , expected wholesale price is lower: E p w &lt; a/2 (since y PSi y NS &lt; 1/2 when d &lt; b . Therefore the asymmetry of information that arises in our model forces the manufacturer to cut its wholesale price, on average. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Whenever the manufacturer does not reveal directly its private demand signal, retailers draw indirect inferences about this signal from the wholesale price charged by the manufacturers. Specifically, a higher price is interpreted as a signal of an improved state of demand. Such inferences have the potential to exacerbate the problem of double marginalization that arises in the channel. To alleviate this problem, the manufacturer ends up cutting its wholesale price below the full information optimum. The extent of price cut depends, however, on the extent of competition between the retailers. When the competition between the retailers intensifies, which, in our model implies that the retailers become less differentiated, and the difference (b − d) declines, the manufacturer does not have to cut the price to a very large extent. With a more competitive retailing market, the problem of double marginalization in the channel diminishes, thus reducing the adverse consequences of the inference effect. In particular, when (b − d) is 0, which implies that the retailers are perfectly homogenous, the adverse consequences disappear completely, and E p w = a/2 for all informational regimes, including NS and PSi. In contrast, the problem of double marginalization is most severe when there is no competition between the retailers at all; namely, when d = 0. In this case, the adverse consequences of the inference effect are maximized, thus leading to a significant cut in the wholesale price below the full information level (E p w a/2, in this case, for the NS and PSi regimes).</p><p>We summarize the above insights in Corollary 1.</p><p>Corollary 1. The adverse consequences of the inference effect:</p><p>(i) are mitigated as the manufacturer raises the extent of information sharing with the retailers; namely, p w F S &gt; p w PSi &gt; p w NS (ii) are more severe the more highly differentiated the retailers are the larger the difference b − d .</p><p>The adverse consequences of the inference effect 17 on the manufacturer's pricing decision are similar to those derived in the signaling literature in economics. In this literature, similar distortions arise whenever asymmetrically informed parties interact without being able to credibly and directly share their private information. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Spence (1973)</ref>, the distortions are characterized in the context of the interaction <ref type="bibr">17</ref> It is interesting to note that the inference effect would have similar adverse consequences on the manufacturer if the uncertainty were about the slope of the demand rather than its intercept. Hence the manufacturer would be inclined to directly communicate with the retailer information about price sensitivity of the consumers instead of allowing the retailer to infer this sensitivity via p w .

However, to evaluate the manufacturer's expected benefit from the information sharing, we put the equilibrium pricing decision rules back into the objective function of the manufacturer for each of the informational regimes the manufacturer may choose in the first stage of the game. In Lemma 2, we state the expressions for those expected profits.</p><p>Lemma 2. The maximized first-stage expected profits of the manufacturer are</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E NS m = V 2b y NS 2 + 2b b −d +s 0 y NS • 4b +s 0 s i s j + 2b +d s 0 s i +s j 4b 2 i j −d 2 2 s 2 0 E PSi m = V 2b y PSi 2 + 2b +d b −d +s 0 y PS • 2b +s 0 s i s j + 2bs j +ds i s 0 4b 2 i j −d 2 2 s 2 0 E F S m = V 2b y F S 2 where V ≡ a 2 + b +d 2 2 +s 0 2b −d b +d −1</formula><p>Using the expressions of Lemma 2, we can now establish our first proposition.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Proposition 1.

Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E PS1 m &gt; E PS2 m if s 1 &gt; s 2 .</formula><p>Proposition 1 states that if the manufacturer chooses to transmit information to exactly one of the retailers, it will choose the less-informed one. To understand why, recall that it is the reduction of the inference effect that benefits the manufacturer when sharing information. When the manufacturer is in the noinformation-sharing regime and considers revealing x 0 to exactly one retailer, it evaluates in which channel the inference effect is most severe. Equation ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) indicates that inferences on the demand component u are more sensitive to wholesale price p w for the retailer with lower signal precision (i.e., larger s i ). Thus, losses because of the inference effect on wholesale price are greatest with retailer 1. If we interpret s 1 &gt; s 2 as saying retailer 1 is less informed than retailer 2, then the manufacturer has greater benefit from informing the less-informed channel member.</p><p>However, according to part (i) of the proposition, even if the manufacturer shares information with the less-informed retailer, it can further benefit from revealing its demand signal to the better-informed retailer as well. The question that remains, however, is whether this benefit is greater or smaller now that the competing retailer has been informed. This question is relevant in view of our earlier assertion that sustaining information sharing with each retailer may be costly, given the investment in physical and human capital it requires. If the benefit from information sharing with the second retailer increases after the first retailer is informed, it would imply that the manufacturer always chooses to inform both retailers if it is optimal to inform one. We show, however, in Proposition 2 that this may not be the case.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Proposition 2. (i) E F S m − E PSi m &gt; 0 i = 1 2.

Higher differentiation, and therefore relaxed competition between the retailers makes the double-marginalization problem severe, and the manufacturer is tempted to reduce its wholesale price. However, when the well-informed retailer's signal is of sufficiently higher quality, there is little gain for the manufacturer from sharing information with this retailer. The well-informed retailer relies only a little on its inferences from the manufacturer's wholesale price when forming its expectations about the demand, and the manufacturer is not tempted to make significant price reductions. Therefore the manufacturer does not benefit much from sharing information with the wellinformed retailer given that it already has shared with the less-informed one. This result, together with Proposition 1, implies that if the cost associated with information sharing is sufficiently high, the manufacturer may choose to share information with the lessinformed retailer rather than both retailers. 19</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Two-Sided Information Sharing</head><p>The model of §3 involved one-sided information transmission. In this section, we extend this model to include bilateral IE. When the manufacturer decides to share information with a retailer, information is transmitted not only from the manufacturer to the retailer, but also from the retailer to the manufacturer. In this section, we show that the inference effect may still sway the manufacturer in the direction of sharing information with the less-informed retailer in spite of the fact that it receives less precise information in return.</p><p>To simplify the derivation, we restrict attention to the case that one of the retailers is perfectly informed, and the other does not have access to any valuable information about the state of the demand. Let retailer 1 be the perfectly informed retailer and retailer 2 be the perfectly uninformed retailer, then using our earlier notation, s 1 = 0 and s 2 → . We now investigate the relative benefit to the manufacturer of sharing information with retailer 1 versus retailer 2. To evaluate this relative benefit, in Lemma 3, we derive the expected profits of the manufacturer from partial information sharing with only one retailer (retailer 1 or retailer 2).</p><p>Lemma 3. When s 1 = 0 and s 2 → , the expected profit of the manufacturer from partial information sharing with only one retailer is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">E PS1 m = a 2 + b + d 2 6b 2 − bd − d 2 2b 2 + bd + d 2 2b − d b + d 32b 3</formula><p>19 Another benefit for exclusive sharing with a less informed retailer may be the following. Suppose the less informed retailer has also less channel power than the more informed one. If sharing demand information improves supply chain efficiency and, thereby, lowers the weaker retailer's cost, then this retailer can, in principle, compete more aggressively with the stronger retailer. The manufacturer may benefit from more channel power with the stronger retailer, as a result.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">E PS2 m = 1 2b − d b + d 128b 5 a 2 + b + d 2 2 + s 0 • 8b 3 +d 2b +d b −d 8b 3 −d 2b +d b −d</formula><p>From Lemma 3, we can calculate the net benefit, denoted by DD, to the manufacturer from sharing information with the uninformed instead of the informed retailer, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">DD = E PS2 m − E PS1 m = a 2 + b +d 2 b −d 2 16b 3 b +d +2b 2 d b +d −d 3 2b +d 2b −d b +d 128b 5 − 6b 2 − bd − d 2 2b 2 + bd + d 2 b + d s 0 2b − d 32b 3 + s 0 (12)</formula><p>Communicating with the uninformed retailer, retailer 2, instead of the informed retailer, introduces the following trade-off for the manufacturer. On the one hand, the benefits of alleviating the inference effect is higher with the uninformed retailer. On the other hand, the manufacturer gets worse information in return with this retailer. The expression for DD in (12) captures these counteracting incentives. The first term, which is positive, precisely measures the benefit accruing to the manufacturer when retailer 2 does not use wholesale price p w to make inferences about the signal x 0 . The second term, which is negative, reflects the opportunity cost of the manufacturer from not communicating with retailer 1 and learning the precise signal, x 1 .</p><p>It is directly seen that the first term of DD dominates the second for relatively small values of the parameters of d and s 0 . Hence, as the degree of differentiation between the retailers increases, and as the precision of the private signal of the manufacturer improves, the manufacturer is more likely to communicate with the uninformed retailer, if it chooses to communicate with only one retailer. As was pointed out earlier, the adverse consequences of the inference effect are especially pronounced when the retailers are highly differentiated because the problem of double marginalization is severe in this case. As well, when the signal of the manufacturer is relatively precise, the added benefit of obtaining more precise information from the perfectly informed retailer is relatively small.</p><p>When the values of the parameters d and s 0 are not sufficiently small, the manufacturer prefers communication with the informed retailer, retailer 1. In Proposition 3, we summarize the relative incentives of the manufacturer to communicate with the uninformed versus informed retailer. Proposition 3. When there is two-way communication between the manufacturer and a single retailer and s 1 = 0 and s 2 → , the manufacturer will communicate with the uninformed retailer (retailer 2) if the parameters Marketing Science 27(4), pp. 642-658, © 2008 INFORMS d and s 0 are sufficiently small. Otherwise, it will communicate with the perfectly informed retailer (retailer 1).</p><p>Recall from §3 that the inference effect for a given channel is intimately related to the level of double marginalization. Our modeling framework provides a mechanism for controlling the extent of this double marginalization through the differentiation parameter d. By considering d at 0 and at b, we see in Corollary 2 how double marginalization affects the relative trade-off of partial communication described in (12) by DD.</p><p>Corollary 2. With partial communication, (i) when d = 0, the manufacturer will share information with the uninformed retailer if s 0 / + s 0 &lt; a 2 + b 2 /3b 2 .

Part (ii) of the corollary confirms the following intuition. When retailers are perfectly competitive (d = b), the doublemarginalization problem does not exist. Therefore the manufacturer has nothing to gain from sharing information with the uninformed retailer because there is no inference effect. In terms of (12), the first term is zero, which implies that DD is negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Detecting the Incentives for Information Sharing</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, smoothing production and delivery schedules is a common benefit attributed to information sharing. Our model isolates a second benefit: the reduction of the inference effect.</p><p>The comparative statics we conduct in our analysis allows us to derive two hypotheses to help us identify the possible existence of this second incentive. The first hypothesis relates to the degree of retail competition in a given setting. Recall that on the one hand, the inference effect is less pronounced in highly competitive retail environments as competition reduces double marginalization. On the other hand, highly competitive retailers have incentives to cut operating costs to price more aggressively. One way to cut costs is to improve supply chain efficiency through information sharing. Thus we arrive at the following: Hypothesis 1. In more competitive retail environments, 20 there are fewer information-sharing alliances <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Various measures of the extent of the competition in a given market have been developed in economics, including the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and n-firm concentration ratios.</p><p>(two-sided information-sharing arrangements) between manufacturers and retailers.</p><p>If empirical research reveals an inverse relationship between the extent of retail competition and the incidence of information-sharing alliances, then it is likely that the inference effect is indeed present in addition to efficiency considerations. If, on the other hand, a direct relationship between those two variables is empirically observed, then improving supply chain efficiencies may be the dominating force behind the incentives to share information between manufacturers and retailers. 21 (According to Proposition 3, although the inference effect may still be a factor, it is impossible, in this case, to distinguish it from supply chain efficiency considerations.)</p><p>A second hypothesis that is implied by our model offers another test to identify the possible existence of the inference effect. This hypothesis relates to the precision of the information that is available to the retailers. According to our analysis, the inference effect is more pronounced in channels with poorly informed retailers. Hence, when retailers make relatively small investments in IT, manufacturers may be more inclined to form information-sharing alliances with them to eliminate the distortions that arise because of the inference effect. However, when manufacturers are motivated by supply chain efficiencies, they gain more by forming alliances with wellinformed retailers that make significant investments in information infrastructure. Hence we obtain the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2. In channels where retailers make large investments in ITs, there are fewer information-sharing alliances between manufacturers and retailers. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> If empirical research shows an inverse relationship between the extent of investments undertaken by the retailers and the incidence of information-sharing alliances, then it is likely that the inference effect plays a role in such initiatives. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> If, on the other hand, the <ref type="bibr">21</ref> The example of Delta Faucet that was mentioned in the introduction is consistent with Hypothesis 1. The fact that Delta Faucet chose to establish an information-sharing alliance with a niche retailer like True Value Hardware, and not with a large-scale bigbox retailer like Home Depot, implies that Delta Faucet might have been motivated by the elimination of the price distortions caused by the inference effect. Niche retailers face moderate pressures to cut prices in comparison to the big-box retailers, thus giving rise to significant distortions because of the inference effect. relationship between those two variables is shown to be direct, then it is more likely that improving supply chain efficiencies is the dominating force in determining the incentives to form information-sharing alliances in retail channels. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> (Once again, Proposition 3 supports the possible existence of the inference effect in this case as well. With a direct relationship, it is impossible to distinguish, however, between this effect and the benefit of improving supply chain efficiencies.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks and Extensions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Summary of the Results</head><p>This paper investigates the nature of informationsharing arrangements in a distribution channel when retailers are asymmetrically informed. Specifically, we asked: Should a manufacturer, possessing key information about the state of demand for its product, share this information with the retailer better or worse informed than a rival? Indeed, casual intuition might suggest a retailer already poised with superior information will offer a better return on the manufacturer's investment on an information-sharing arrangement. We showed, however, that this reasoning misses the role of retailers' inferences on the state of demand communicated through the wholesale price set by the manufacturer. Accounting for what we called the inference effect, this research suggests that there may be larger benefits from sharing with the more poorly informed retailer. When the manufacturer does not share its private information about the state of demand, the inference effect forces the manufacturer to distort wholesale price downward to alleviate double-marginalization problems. This effect is present for either retailer. However, it is more pronounced the less precise a retailer's own information is about demand conditions. Of course, there can be benefits from sharing information uniformly across all retail channels. But, if setting up and installing such systems is costly, then trade-offs arise.</p><p>24 Hypothesis 2 is consistent with another example we have discussed in the introduction. The snack producer, Nabisco, initiated an information-sharing arrangement with the relatively small (67 stores in 2004) grocery chain, Wegmans <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boyle 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, VICS 1999</ref>). Such a choice would seem to be inconsistent with a recent observation made by the Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA).</p><p>Based on surveys conducted by GMA, mass merchandisers were the retailers most likely to adopt CPFR, and the main reason cited for such information-sharing arrangements was to "reduce outof-stocks" (GMA: 2002 CPFR Baseline Study). It seems, therefore, that reducing the adverse consequences of the inference effect may have guided Nabisco in choosing a smaller chain that is likely to be far less informed about demand conditions than the mass merchandisers.</p><p>We also investigated the benefits accruing to a manufacturer when it can acquire retailer-specific information from a sharing arrangement. This complicates the above trade-off because exclusive information exchange with the less-informed retailer, offers the manufacturer, in return, a less precise signal of the demand than if it had shared with the other, betterinformed retailer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Extensions</head><p>To investigate the issues mentioned here, we constructed an analytical model that employed a number of simplifying assumptions. It is instructive, however, to anticipate the implication of relaxing some of them.</p><p>We assumed, for instance, that the manufacturer makes its wholesale pricing decision based solely on the demand signal observed. This implies that the retailers can perfectly infer the manufacturer's private signal when observing its wholesale price. We made this simplifying assumption to highlight the inference effect. However, in reality, there may be additional supply-side uncertainties that face the manufacturer and affect its pricing decision, and therefore introduce noise in the wholesale price. When there is noise in the wholesale price, the degree of inference is lessened, thus reducing the manufacturer's losses through the inference effect distortions. Note that information sharing, in this case, introduces additional benefits to the retailers as well, because they can directly observe the private demand information of the manufacturer. In the absence of sharing, the retailers can only infer a noisy signal of the manufacturer's private information.</p><p>We also assumed that the manufacturer is restricted to uniform wholesale pricing. If the manufacturer is able to price discriminate, retailers may still infer the manufacturer's signal through the channel-specific wholesale price. Recall that a retailer's inference is possible because it can solve the manufacturer's optimal decision rule to learn the signal. Thus the manufacturer benefits through the reduction of the inference effect when sharing information with a retailer. However, with the ability to set retailerspecific prices, the economics of price discrimination suggests that the manufacturer appropriates more of the channel profit, which makes information sharing more likely.</p><p>The inference effect in our model is driven by the double-marginalization problem in the channel. As is well known, nonlinear wholesale pricing can perfectly alleviate this problem. To the extent that the manufacturer can use nonlinear pricing, the benefits of information sharing revealed here may be reduced. However, given that linear (or unit) pricing is commonly observed in practice <ref type="bibr">(Iyer and Villas-Boas 2003)</ref>, we expect the inference effect to be present in many actual retail settings. Our model also assumed that the manufacturer posts a nonnegotiable wholesale price. It is reasonable, however, to imagine that a retail buyer can haggle or negotiate wholesale terms. To consider this possibility in the context of our model, suppose a retailer and the manufacturer enter a bargaining process in stage 3 in which both parties make alternating offers of price <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rubinstein 1982)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> In principle, offers made by each party reflect its own private information. Specifically, the manufacturer's offers can be used by the retailer to infer x 0 , leading to the familiar distortions of the inference effect. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Finally, in contrast to our model, a retailer may have supply alternatives rather than a single manufacturer. It is therefore interesting to consider the consequence of upstream competition. The presence of a competing supplier puts downward pressure on wholesale prices. Nevertheless, the retailer's ability to infer the manufacturer's private signal is, in principle, undeterred.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">The condition = 0 ensures that the manufacturer's decision rule is an invertible function of its private signal. In fact, it is intuitive that &gt; 0, since the manufacturer will respond to a higher demand parameter with a higher price. As we show in Lemma 1, this is indeed the case in equilibrium.13  Wholesale prices may depend on many other factors, including different production costs, competitive positioning, and profit targets. If all of these factors are deterministic, drawing perfect inferences about the stochastic demand signal x 0 is still possible. The additional factors are simply reflected in this case in the values of the coefficients 0 and . However, if there is some stochastic element in determining the value of additional factors, retailers will be able to draw only imperfect inferences from p w .

These hypotheses cannot be used in environments where nonlinear wholesale pricing is employed (see the related discussion in §6.2).23  Note that retailers that can afford to make large-scale investments in IT may also carry greater channel power. The greater extent to which this additional channel power permits the retailer greater say in decisions made with the manufacturer, the further we depart from our assumption of the manufacturer as the Stackelberg leader.</note>

For example, the bargaining power could be better for the better informed retailer (as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Geylani et al. 2007)</ref>. Suppose this retailer has full ability to dictate wholesale price upstream but the manufacturer has the power to set a take-it-or-leave-it price to the other retailer. Our analysis implies that the inference effect remains vis-à-vis the less-informed retailer but disappears for the well-informed retailer.</note>
