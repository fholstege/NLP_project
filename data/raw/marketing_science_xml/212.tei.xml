<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the entry of copycats and its implications by incorporating two salient features; these features are two product attributes, i.e., physical resemblance and product quality, and two consumer utilities, i.e., consumption utility and status utility. Our equilibrium analysis suggests that copycats with a high physical resemblance but low product quality are more likely to successfully enter the market by defying the deterrence of the incumbent. Furthermore, we show that higher quality can prevent the copycat from successfully entering the market. Finally, we show that the entry of copycats does not always improve consumer surplus and social welfare. In particular, when the quality of the copycat is sufficiently low, the loss in status utility from consumers of the incumbent product overshadows the small gain in consumption utility from buyers of the copycat, leading to an overall decrease in consumer surplus and social welfare.</p><p>History: Ganesh Iyer served as the senior editor and Anthony Dukes served as associate editor for this article.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fake goods aren't totally bad, at least it created jobs at some counterfeit factories . . . . We don't want to be a brand that nobody wants to copy.</p><p>Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli (as quoted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Galante 2012)</ref> Copycats are generally quickly (and sometimes illegally) produced. They are usually low-priced and lower-quality replicas of products that enjoy substantial brand value <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lai and Zaichkowsky 1999)</ref>. As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Katz (1960)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wilcox et al. (2009)</ref>, many consumers knowingly purchase nondeceptive copycats of luxury brands mainly due to the social status associated with the luxury brands. For this reason, the market for copycat goods is huge. Last year, American border officials nabbed copies that, had they been genuine, would have been worth $1.2 billion. Their European Union counterparts seized E768 million ($1 billion) of fakes in 2013. Yet these were surely a fraction of the counterfeits being peddled. Estimates for the total value of fakes sold worldwide each year go as high as $1.8 trillion <ref type="bibr">(Economist, The 2015)</ref>. Efficient supply networks, inconsistent law enforcement, and large underserved markets have enabled many firms in China and other developing countries to produce and sell imitation products. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A recent report issued by the United Nations suggests that 70% of all copycats of fashion and luxury goods is produced in China. In fact, a new term "Shanzhai" has been created to denote those imitations and copycats produced in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Siu et al. 2010 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tse et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> In general, most copycat products exhibit the following five characteristics:</p><p>1. High Resemblance. By definition, copycat products usually show a high resemblance to genuine "branded" products in terms of brand names or external designs.</p><p>2. Low Selling Price. Copycat products are usually sold at a low price partly because they enjoy extremely low production cost, i.e., they incur no research and development (R&amp;D) costs, promotion and marketing costs, licensing fees, etc. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> 3. Nondeceptive. Many copycat products are nondeceptive to the buyers in the sense that the buyers are fully aware that the products are not genuine from the price they paid or from the channel from which the product was purchased. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cho et al. 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> However, even though copycat products are nondeceptive to the buyers, their physical resemblance to the incumbent products can deceive other consumers into believing that the copycat products are genuine. Therefore, when the resemblance level of the copycat product becomes higher, it can deceive more people into perceiving the copycat as authentic. Consequently, the "social utility" derived from a copycat product depends on the proportion of the market that perceives the product to be genuine, which, in turn, depends on the physical resemblance level.</p><p>4. Low Quality. Relative to the luxury brand that they are mimicking, copycat products are generally of low Gao, Lim, and Tang: Entry of Copycats of Luxury Brands <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 272-289, Â© 2016</ref> quality. For instance, the curator of the Fashion Institute of Technology, Ariele Elia, commented that "With (genuine) designer items, there is quality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lieber 2014)</ref>.</p><p>5. Rapid Product Launch. Partly due to its efficient supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Siu et al. 2010)</ref>, most copycat products are launched shortly after the launch of genuine brands. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In emerging markets, copycats provide access to imitation products to those who cannot afford or are unwilling to pay the high selling price of the genuine luxury products. At the same time, these copycats can generate profits from piggybacking on the product development of the incumbent firms. To some extent, copycats are encroaching on the market of the incumbent firm, which raises major concerns from the incumbent's perspective. These observations have motivated us to examine the following research questions:</p><p>1. In the presence of a potential copycat, under what conditions is it possible for the incumbent to deter its entry?</p><p>2. In the presence of a potential copycat, what is the incumbent's pricing strategy?</p><p>3. Which type of copycat, in terms of physical resemblance and product quality, can gain successful entry? 4. Will the presence of copycats always improve consumer surplus? What is the impact of the presence of potential copycats on social welfare? The first two questions examine the strategic dynamics between the incumbent and the copycat, and identify conditions under which the incumbent can deter the entrance of copycats. The third question attempts to explain why we tend to observe copycat products of high resemblance and low quality in practice as discussed earlier. The fourth question examines the conventional wisdom that copycats create additional consumer surplus and social welfare as articulated by Prada's CEO in 2012.</p><p>To examine these questions, we present a two-period dynamic game model to capture the strategic interactions between an incumbent (I) and a copycat (C) over two time periods. Our model incorporates two salient features: (a) two types of copycat characteristics, i.e., resemblance and quality relative to the incumbent product; and (b) two types of consumer utilities associated with a product, i.e., consumption utility that depends on the product quality, and status utility that depends on the copycat's resemblance to the incumbent product and the consumer's purchasing decision of the incumbent and the copycat products.</p><p>Our equilibrium analysis enables us to provide the following answers to our research questions:</p><p>1. Conditions under which the incumbent can deter the copycat's entry. When the incumbents' production cost is sufficiently close to that of the copycat's, the incumbent should sell its product at a lower price to capture the entire market (so as to deter the copycat's entry). In other words, the incumbent can afford to "flood the market" to prevent the copycat's entry. This result is consistent with the way genuine music CDs deterred the entrance of copycats in China in the 1990s.</p><p>2. Implications of the potential entry of the copycat on the incumbent's selling price. Regardless of the actual entry of the copycat, the potential threat associated with the copycat's entry is sufficient to force the incumbent to lower its selling price.</p><p>3. Characteristics of copycats that can successfully enter the market without being deterred by the incumbent. Our equilibrium analysis shows that, when it is profitable for a copycat to enter the market, its product tends to exhibit high resemblance and low quality (relative to the incumbent product).</p><p>4. Implications of the potential entry of the copycat on consumer surplus and social welfare. By contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that the entry of a copycat does not always improve consumer surplus or social welfare.</p><p>The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, contrary to extant literature on copycats, our paper focuses exclusively on nondeceptive copycats whereby consumers are fully aware, at the point of purchase, that the copycat product is an imitation. Second, we present a model that captures two salient features associated with copycat products, i.e., resemblance and quality of the copycat product, as well as consumption and status utilities for the consumers. To our knowledge, these features have not been examined in the literature and thus provide a novel and substantive dimension to this paper. Third, apart from establishing pricing as a deterrence strategy that the incumbent should adopt in equilibrium, our results explain why most copycat products tend to be high on physical resemblance and yet low on quality. At the same time, we show that the presence of copycats is not always beneficial in terms of consumer surplus and social welfare, despite conventional wisdom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Literature</head><p>The extant literature on counterfeits (or copycats) has focused on the demand for copycats. Price, attitude towards branded companies, and the need for status signaling have been cited as the main factors driving copycat demand. Examples include <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Han et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wilcox et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bloch et al. (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kwong et al. (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tom et al. (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cordell et al. (1996)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wee et al. (1995)</ref>. Using a Cournot competition model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grossman and Shapiro (1988)</ref> studied the case when the quality of the product is not observable. Much as the paper modeled products along dimensions of status and quality, status utility is modeled to depend on the brand itself and independent of the number of buyers of the product. They concluded that policies that deter copycats may not improve social welfare. This finding is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al. (2015)</ref>. Qian <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 272-289, Â© 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">INFORMS (2014</ref> examined the economic impact of copycats and the impact on the brand management strategy of firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Qian et al. (2015)</ref> further examined how incumbents may seek to differentiate their products in response to entries by (deceptive) copycat entities. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Qian et al. (2015)</ref> used a signaling model to examine how incumbents may seek to differentiate the products along the dimensions of searchable and experiential qualities in response to entries by copycat entities. Unlike the existing literature, we consider the case when the status utility of the genuine product and that of the copycat depend on the number of buyers of each product.</p><p>In contrast to this stream of research, we incorporate the social motivations for the consumption of copycats of luxury brands into our framework to examine the strategic interactions between the incumbent and the copycat. To our knowledge, ours is the first paper to examine the impact of nondeceptive copycats by explicitly incorporating physical resemblance and quality of the copycat product as well as the status utility of the consumers into the framework. To this end, we provide a theoretical explanation as to why copycats observed in practice are often high on physical resemblance but low on product quality. Furthermore, the issue of whether copycats bring value to the consumers and society at large depends on the quality of the copycat. Our analysis extends the findings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grossman and Shapiro (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al. (2015)</ref> that copycats can bring value to the society. Specifically, we show that quality is a key dimension that will determine if this is the case.</p><p>Finally, our paper is related to the literature on limit pricing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bain (1949)</ref> formally established the notion of an incumbent's decision to cut its prices to decrease the potential of entry of a copycat. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Friedman (1979)</ref> on the other hand, argued that a credible threat to cut prices on entry can be sufficient to deter entry and is a more effective and profitable action for the incumbent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Spence (1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Spence ( , 1979</ref> further expanded on the use of strategic commitments to deter entry. <ref type="bibr">Hall (2009)</ref> offered a review of this literature, arguing that limit pricing exists as an equilibrium under some conditions. We also elaborate on the incumbents' commitment to its price going forward.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the model and the findings. In Section 5, we discuss the implications for consumer surplus and social welfare. In Section 6, we discuss some extensions. Section 7 provides concluding remarks. All proofs are provided in the appendix. The complete backward induction analysis is given in the online appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model</head><p>We describe the sequence of events before we formulate the market and consumer characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sequence of Events</head><p>We consider a two-period game with observable actions between the incumbent I and the copycat firm C. At the beginning of Period 1, I launches a new product of intrinsic quality q I (normalized to 1) and determines its selling price p I . Upon observing I's product price p I , C first decides whether to enter or to stay out of the market at the beginning of Period 2. If C enters, it enters with a copycat product and sets it selling price p C . <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The unit production cost for I is k I , where k I â (0, 1). We assume that the copycat's unit production cost is k C &lt; k I . The reason for C to enjoy a lower marginal production cost is that C neither invests in promotion and regular advertisement nor fulfils any regulatory or licensing requirement that will increase the marginal cost of production. Upon observing p I , p C , Î±, and q, each consumer makes her purchase decision that maximizes her total (consumption and status) utility. The sequence of events is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In our model, the copycat product is different from the incumbent product along two attributes: (a) the physical resemblance Î±, where Î± â (0, 1); and (b) the product quality q, where q â (0, 1) (i.e., the copycat product is of a lower quality than the incumbent). As an initial attempt to examine the implications of resemblance Î± and quality q of copycat products in a game theoretic model, we shall assume that resemblance and quality of the copycat product are given exogenously. This assumption enables us to explore which type of copycat tends to gain successful entry in equilibrium.</p><p>First, we use physical resemblance Î± to refer to the extent in which the products are physically alike and the "likelihood" that the copycat product will be identified by the market as the incumbent product. For instance, by copying prominent insignias used in luxury leather goods, a copycat product can increase its physical resemblance Î±. In general, it is relatively less costly for the copycat to increase its physical resemblance than to improve product quality.</p><p>We assume that the quality of the copycat product q is always strictly less than the incumbent's (i.e., q &lt; 1). This assumption is reasonable and necessary for the following reason. Suppose that the copycat product is of exactly the same quality as that of the incumbent. Then the copycat can easily have a product that is an exact physical replica of the incumbent's product. In this case, owing to a lower marginal production cost, the copycat product is actually more competitive than the incumbent product and the copycat can foreclose the incumbent's market, in which case, the copycat does not have anything in the market to "copy." Imagine a leather bag with an insignia that does not have a well-known brand attached to it. Of what value, then, is the copycat brand? For the framework to be relevant to our research question, we assume that the quality of the copycat product is always lower than that  of the incumbent. Nonetheless, it can be sufficiently close (q close to 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Market Conditions</head><p>Our base model is based on the following market conditions. First, we assume that the time interval between the two periods is so short that consumers are confronted with products of I and C at almost the same time if C chooses to enter the market. This assumption implies that there are virtually no sales of the incumbent product in Period 1. As described earlier, this assumption is observed in practice due to the speed at which C can enter the market. Recall Tom Ford's earlier statement that "(My items) will be (copied and sold) at Zara's stores before I can get them in the store" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(London 2013</ref>). To examine the robustness of our results obtained in the base model, we relax this assumption in Section 6.1 so that the time interval between the two periods is long enough so that the sales of the incumbent can take place in Period 1 before the entry of the copycat in Period 2. Using the same approach to analyze this extension, we find that the key results continue to hold. We incorporate the notion of irreversibility of the incumbent's price p I in our model. As highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Spence (1977)</ref>, irreversibility is a way for the firm to commit itself in advance and to issue a credible threat to potential entry. Specifically, to avoid diluting the brand image, most luxury brands do not lower the selling price or launch new products to compete with a copycat. For this reason and for tractability, we assume that the incumbent will not change its selling price and will not launch another product to compete with the copycat product upon its entry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Two Types of Consumer Utility</head><p>In our model, there are N (normalized to 1) infinitesimal consumers in the market: Each consumer i has wealth v i , where v i â¼ U[0, 1]. Instead of considering the case when social status is an increasing function of wealth, we assume, for ease of exposition, that Consumer i's wealth v i corresponds perfectly to her social status. For each consumer, we first define the intrinsic consumption utility as well as the status utility for buyers and nonbuyers derived from a "generic" product with a functional quality q. In Section 3.5, we describe how the status utility depends on the resemblance factor Î± and the number of buyers who purchased Product I versus C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumption Utility for Buyers and Nonbuyers.</head><p>We model a consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for a product of quality q as directly proportional to her wealth level v i so that the lifetime utility from consumption is v i q. In other words, if a consumer with wealth v i purchases a product of quality q at price p, she obtains a net consumption utility of (v i q â p). For nonbuyers, the consumption utility is equal to 0.</p><p>Status Utility for Buyers. Consider the case when there is a continuum <ref type="bibr">[ v,v]</ref> of buyers and a continuum [0, v] of nonbuyers. By adopting the status utility model developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rao and Schaefer (2013)</ref>, the entire group of buyers with v i â <ref type="bibr">[ v,v]</ref> will share the same status utility, which can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">7 Î» â«Â¯v v v i dv i â«Â¯v v dv i Î»v + v 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Î» (Î» â (0, 1)) represents the consumer's sensitivity to status utility. Essentially, the status utility is equal to the sensitivity Î» times the expected wealth level of the buyers in the group.</p><p>Status Utility for Nonbuyers. To incorporate the notion of "social comparison," the status utility of the nonbuyers should be lower than that of the buyers and it should depend on the number of buyers and nonbuyers. Therefore, if we set the status utility for nonbuyers to 0, the status utility for nonbuyers will be independent of the wealth level of the nonbuyers with wealth [0, v] as well as the number of buyers and nonbuyers.</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 272-289, Â© 2016</ref> For this reason, we set the status utility for the group of nonbuyers with</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">v i â [0, v] as Î» â« v 0 v i dv i â« v 0 dv i Î» v 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Observe from (2) that the status utility for nonbuyers is increasing in v. Hence, the status utility for nonbuyers can increase (decrease) when there are fewer (more) buyers for the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Consumer's Threshold Purchasing Policy</head><p>Before we analyze the pricing strategies of I and C (with potential entry), we now examine the consumer's rational purchasing behavior in equilibrium. As we show in Section 3.5, regardless of the entry of C, all rational consumers will follow a "threshold purchasing policy" in equilibrium. Instead of proving similar threshold policies for different settings (I operates as a monopoly, I and C operate as a duopoly with incumbent and copycat products, etc.), we now present a unified model to analyze the consumer's purchasing policy in equilibrium so as to avoid repetition. Without loss of generality, we consider the most general case in which both products from I and C are available in the market. As we show in Section 3.5, all consumers will follow a threshold purchasing policy [Ï C , Ï I ] that can be described as follows: (a) Consumers with wealth v i â [0, Ï C ] will buy nothing, (b) consumers with wealth v i â [Ï C , Ï I ] will buy C, and (c) consumers with wealth v i â [Ï I , 1] will buy I. Note that the thresholds Ï C and Ï I depend on p I , p C , Î±, q, and Î». Also, it can be shown that this form of threshold purchasing policy is an equilibrium policy, i.e., no consumer can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating from this policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Consumption Utility and Status Utility Associated With a Threshold</head><p>Purchasing Policy For any threshold purchasing policy [Ï C , Ï I ], we now determine the consumption utility and status utility of three different groups of consumers: (1) buyers of I with wealth</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v i â [Ï I , 1]; (2) buyers of C with wealth v i â [Ï C , Ï I ] ; and (3) nonbuyers with wealth v i â [0, Ï C ].</formula><p>Consumption Utility. By using the consumption utility as defined in Section 3.2 along with the fact that the quality of I is equal to 1 and the quality of C is equal to q, it is easy to check that the consumption utility for each buyer of I is equal to (v i â¢ 1 â p I ), for each buyer of C is equal to (v i â¢ q â p C ), and for each nonbuyer is equal to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status Utility.</head><p>We can use the same approach as presented in Section 3.2 to determine the status utility of each of the three groups of consumers. However, in the presence of copycat C, the status utility of each group depends on whether the market can identify the copycat product C as "fake." For this reason, we consider two separate cases by incorporating the notion of social comparison as explained in Section 3.3: Case 1: The market cannot identify C as fake with probability Î±. When the market cannot distinguish between the incumbent product I and the copycat product C, the market will recognize the buyers of C and the buyers of I as having the same social status. Hence, both groups of buyers will be treated as a "combined" group of buyers with wealth level v i â [Ï C , 1]. By applying (1), the buyers of I and the buyers of C will enjoy the same status utility, which is equal to Î»((1 + Ï C )/2). By applying (2), the nonbuyers will obtain a status utility of Î»(Ï C /2).</p><p>Case 2: The market can identify C as fake with probability (1 â Î±). When the market can clearly distinguish between the incumbent product I and the copycat C, the market will recognize the buyers of I are consumers with wealth level v i â [Ï I , 1]. By applying (1), the buyers of I will obtain a status utility Î»((1 + Ï I )/2). At the same time, the market recognizes that the buyers of C are different from the buyers of I and that they have a lower social status than the buyers of I. In the base model, we assume that the market will treat the buyers of C as nonbuyers (i.e., as if they did not buy anything). Consequently, the buyers of C and those nonbuyers will be treated as a "combined" group of "nonbuyers" with wealth level v i â [0, Ï I ]. By applying (2), the buyers of C and the nonbuyers will enjoy the same status utility, which is equal to Î»(Ï I /2), which is lower than that of the buyers of I.

Also, we have determined the total expected utility of each consumer as given in (3).

Observe from Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> that the lower right-hand corner corresponds to the case when k I â¤ k C , which is inadmissible because we assume that the production cost of I is higher than that of C, i.e., k I &gt; k C . Also, the upper lefthand corner of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> corresponds to the case when the incumbent I does not enter the market because k I is too high. Without an incumbent firm, there is no product to "copy" and so the problem becomes trite. Therefore, it suffices to consider those shaded cases as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>First, we examine the entry strategy of the copycat as well as the deterrence strategy of the incumbent in equilibrium. Our main question is: Under what conditions can limit pricing enable I to deter the entrance of C? Proposition 1 provides an answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 1 (Entry Deterrence). Copycat C will not enter the market in equilibrium if and only if</head><formula xml:id="formula_13">k I â k C â¤ Î»(1 â Î±)/2 â 2(1 â q) and k C â¤ Î»Î±/2.</formula><p>Proposition 1 has the following implications. First, when k C â¤ Î»Î±/2, the incumbent I can deter the entry of C when the cost differential between I and C (i.e., k I â k C ) satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(k I â k C ) â¤ Î»(1 â Î±)/2 â 2(1 â q).</formula><p>Second, apart from cost differential, the condition for deterrence is likely to hold when the consumer's sensitivity towards status utility (Î») is high, when the copycat's quality (q) is high or when the copycat's physical resemblance (Î±) is low. While incumbent I cannot control copycat's quality q, incumbent I can deter C's entry by increasing Î». To do so, I can enhance the status image through advertising as well as celebrity endorsements. Also, I can deter C's entry by designing a product that is difficult or costly for the copycat to replicate so that Î± is kept low.</p><p>By contrast, Proposition 1 reveals the condition when the incumbent I cannot deter the entry of C, for example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">k I â k C &gt; Î»(1 â Î±)/2 â 2(1 â q).</formula><p>On close examination of this condition, we conclude that the copycat can successfully enter the market with a product that is high in physical resemblance Î±, and low in quality q. This result is consistent with the characteristics of most copycat products commonly observed in practice. Furthermore, in the event when the two product attributes (quality q and physical resemblance Î±) are correlated, it is easy to check from those two conditions as stated in Proposition 1 that only a copycat with low quality q and high resemblance Î± can successfully enter the market.</p><p>While it is desirable for C to enter the market by offering products with high resemblance so that buyers can enjoy a higher expected status utility, it is less obvious why C would prefer to enter the market with low quality products. The rationale for a low quality copycat can be explained as follows. First, suppose C attempts to enter the market with a high quality product (q is close to 1) as well as a high resemblance (Î± is close to 1). Then all consumers, regardless of wealth level, will prefer the product of I or that of C. This preference is solely determined by the prices p I , p C . Hence, this entry strategy of copycat C will trigger a price war between I and C, and the chances of obtaining market share for C are limited. Clearly, it is not optimal for C, as a copycat firm that leverages on the status utility that the incumbent provides, to "kick" the incumbent out of the market. If that happens, the value of the product of C diminishes and C will end up with no demand as well; imagine a Prada look-a-like bag when Prada is no longer in the market. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Second, suppose C attempts to enter the market with a product with a high resemblance level (Î± is close to 1) and low quality (q is close to 0). Then, clearly the deterrence condition stated in Proposition 1 does not hold. In this case, to gain some market share, C has to set p C sufficiently low so that the incumbent I cannot afford to undercut C's price and stay profitable. Consequently, the incumbent I cannot afford to deter C's entry, and the market is segmented between I and C.</p><p>Next, consider the case when C can gain access to the market (i.e., without being deterred by I). Given a successful market entry, would C benefit from offering a product with higher quality? The following proposition provides an answer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Proposition 2 (Copycat's Profit Is Nonmonotonic in Qual- ity). When k C â[Î»Î±/2â(1â q), k I ], k I â[min(â2k C +(Î»/2)â¢ (1 + 2Î±) â (1âq), Î»Î±/2),max(Î»/2 + (1âq), (1/(2âq)) â¢ (k C â Î»Î±/2)+ Î»Î±/2+2(1â q)/(2â q))]</formula><p>, copycat C will successfully enter the market in equilibrium. However, the profit of C is nonmonotonic in its quality level q.</p><p>Proposition 2 further affirms that better product quality does not always generate higher profit for the copycat, even when the conditions for successful entry have been satisfied and the cost of producing a higherquality product is ignored. This is because a higherquality copycat product inevitably triggers a more intense pricing competition between I and C. However, under the conditions cited above when both k C , k I are relatively large, intense pricing competition can lead to the copycat dropping out of the market. As such, the copycat is better off entering the market with a product of a lower quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Consumer Surplus and Social Welfare</head><p>Clearly the successful entry of C will enable consumers with a lower wealth level v i â [Ï C , Ï I ] to gain access to the copycat product at a lower price (instead of the incumbent product that they may be unable to afford or unwilling to buy). In addition, buying the copycat product can enable the buyers to obtain consumption utility and perhaps even status utility (especially when the market cannot identify the copycat product as fake). Therefore, conventional wisdom is that the presence of C would improve consumer surplus and social welfare (in terms of consumer surplus and the total profit of I and C). Is this conventional wisdom always true? While this belief is correct in many instances, there are instances under which the presence of copycat C will actually reduce consumer surplus and/or social welfare. To construct a specific counterexample to show that the presence of copycat C can reduce consumer surplus and/or social welfare, we compare the consumer surplus and social welfare between two cases: (a) the benchmark case when I operates as a monopoly without any potential entry threat from copycat C; and (b) when I and C coexist and capture the entire market together when</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">k C â Î»Î± 2 â (1 â q), Î»Î± 2 , k I â min Î»Î± 2 + (1 â q), Î» 2 â 2(1 â q) 2 â q + 4 â q q(2 â q) âk C + Î»Î± 2 .

This result can be explained as follows: Consider the case when copycat C enters the market with quality q close to 0. By noting from above that Ï I converges to Ï B I when ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">7</ref>) hold and that the corresponding Ï C is equal to 0, we conclude that the presence of a copycat in this case will entice the same group of consumers with wealth v i â [Ï B I , 1] to buy the incumbent product as in the benchmark case. However, the presence of a copycat will entice consumers with wealth v i â [0, Ï B I ] to buy the copycat product so that the entire market is captured by firms I and C. In this case, copycat C's entry will increase consumption utility (due to those buyers of the copycat product C). However, this gain is overshadowed by the loss in the status utility of those buyers of the incumbent product I (due to the resemblance level of the copycat product). Consequently, the presence of a copycat can reduce consumer surplus and social welfare when the copycat's quality q is sufficiently low. In summary, much as copycat products seem to bring value to consumers who would not purchase the incumbent product otherwise, we find that there are instances under which the presence of the copycat product can reduce consumer surplus and social welfare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Extensions</head><p>To examine the robustness of the results from our base model as stated in Propositions 1-3 as well as Corollary 1, we now examine two different extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Extension 1: Sequential Sales of I and C</head><p>In the base model as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we assumed that Period 1 is very short so that there are no sales of the incumbent product in Period 1. Hence, the sales of I and C take place in Period 2. We now extend our analysis to the case when the time interval between the introduction of the incumbent's product and the copycat product is sufficiently large so that the sales of product I can take place in Period 1. More formally, we consider a sequential game associated with the following sequence of events.</p><p>At the beginning of Period 1, I launches a new product of intrinsic quality 1 and determines its selling price p I . Upon observing I's price (p I ), consumers with wealth level v i â [0, 1] decide whether to buy I.</p><p>Here, we assume that consumers in Period 1 are strategic: They make their purchase decisions taking into account the potential entry of a copycat product C and its selling price p C in Period 2. At the beginning of Period 2, C first decides whether to enter or to stay out of the market. If C enters, it provides a product with quality q and physical resemblance Î± as before. At the same time, C decides on prices p C . As before, we assume that the incumbent will continue its commitment (in the context of irreversibility) by not adjusting its price in Period 2. Because sales can take place in Periods 1 and 2, we introduce the discount factor Î´ (Î´ â [0, 1]) to capture the time value of money.</p><p>Using the same approach presented in Section 4 (details are provided in Online Appendix B), we show that the main results obtained from the base model (i.e., Propositions 1-3 and Corollary 1) continue to hold as follows:</p><p>Proposition 4 (Entry Deterrence).

To explain this result, observe that I can deter C's entry only when the incumbent I can capture the entire market, which can occur only when the thresholds Ï I Ï C 0. This deterrence condition is essentially the same under the base model and the extension except the discount factor Î´. Consequently, the structure of Proposition 1 is preserved except that the boundary conditions are adjusted to capture the discount factor Î´. By considering the opposite condition, we can also conclude that C can gain entry by offering a product that is high on resemblance and low on quality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Extension 2: An Alternative Formulation of</head><p>Status Utility Recall from Section 3.5 that we formulated the consumption utility and the status utility for three different groups of consumers associated with a threshold purchasing policy (Ï C , Ï I ) so that the total expected <ref type="bibr">Marketing Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 272-289, Â© 2016</ref>  utility U(v i ) for each consumer with wealth v i is given in (3). This formulation is based on one key assumption as stated in Case 2 in Section 3.5. Specifically, when the market can identify C as fake with probability 1 â Î±, we assumed that the market will treat the buyers of C as nonbuyers (i.e., as if they did not buy anything) so that the buyers of C and those nonbuyers will be treated as a "combined" group of "nonbuyers" with wealth level v i â [0, Ï I ]. Based on this assumption, the buyers of C and the nonbuyers have the same status utility Î»(Ï I /2).</p><p>One may argue that, when the market can identify C as fake, the buyers of C and nonbuyers of I and C should not share the same status utility. 10 There are certainly many plausible alternatives especially when (to our knowledge) there is no formal analysis of status utility comparison between buyers of C and nonbuyers in the literature. In the absence of a grounded theory, we consider one alternative illustrative scenario as follows: When the market can identify C as fake, the market will recognize the buyers of I as consumers with wealth level v i â [Ï I , 1]. By applying (1), the buyers of I will obtain a status utility Î»((1 + Ï I )/2). Also, relative to the buyers of I, the market will recognize the buyers of C as a different group who purchased a product with lower social status. Specifically, the market will treat the buyers as consumers with wealth level v i â [Ï C , Ï I ] so that the buyers of C will obtain a status utility Î»((Ï C + Ï I )/2). Finally, relative to the buyers of I, the market will treat the nonbuyers as consumers with wealth level v i â [0, Ï I ] (as nonbuyers of I) so that they will obtain a status utility Î»(Ï I /2). Unlike the base model, in this scenario the buyers of C have a higher status utility than the nonbuyers. This is certainly a plausible scenario where a copycat product grants its owner a higher social utility than not owning any product at all; this is particularly true in developing societies. As we shall see, the key results obtained in the base model continue to hold in this setting.</p><p>By considering the consumption utility stated in Section 3.5 and the status utility associated with the case when the market cannot identify C as fake (i.e., Case 1 in Section 3.5) and the case when the market can identify C as fake, we compute the total expected utility U(v i ) as before for each consumer with wealth v i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">U(v i ) ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ (v i â¢ 1 â p I ) + Î»( 1 2 Î±(1 + Ï C ) + 1 2 (1 â Î±)(1 + Ï I )) if v i â [Ï I , 1], (v i â¢ q â p C ) + Î»( 1 2 Î±(1 + Ï C ) + (1 â Î±)(Ï I + Ï C )) if v i â [Ï C , Ï I ], 0 + Î»( 1 2 Î±(Ï C ) + 1 2 (1 â Î±)(Ï I )) if v i â [0, Ï C ].<label>(8</label></formula><p>) As expected, the total expected utility U(v i ) given in (8) under the alternative scenario resembles (3) as in the base case except the status utility of the buyers of C. Using the same approach as presented in Section 4 (details are provided in Online Appendix C), we show that the main results obtained in the base model (i.e., Propositions 1-3 and Corollary 1) continue to hold. To avoid repetition, we omit the details here. Essentially, the underlying intuition for why our results continue to hold in this scenario is the same as explained in Section 6.1. For instance, I can deter C's entry only when the incumbent I can capture the entire market, which can occur only when the thresholds Ï I Ï C 0. In this case, there are no buyers of C and there are no nonbuyers. Hence, considering a different status utility for the buyers of C in our scenario has no impact on the deterrence condition as stated in Proposition 1. Thus, Proposition 1 continues to hold in this scenario. Using the same approach presented in Section 4, we show that the structure of all other results as stated in Propositions 2 and 3 and Corollary 1 continue to hold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Copycats of luxury brands are prevalent in the marketplace. This paper seeks to better understand their entry strategy, the deterrent strategy for luxury brands, if any, as well as the implications for consumers and the society at large. We have developed a model to capture two salient features: (a) consumption utility and status utility; and (b) resemblance level and product quality of the copycat product (relative to the incumbent luxury brand product). By solving a dynamic game between the incumbent and the copycat, we have identified the conditions under which the incumbent can deter the entry of the copycats.</p><p>Our analysis reveals that a copycat can successfully gain entry to the market (without being blocked by the incumbent) by launching a product that exhibits high resemblance and low quality. This result provides an explanation for why most copycat products available in the market tend to show high resemblance and yet low quality.</p><p>We have shown that the conventional wisdom that the presence of a copycat product always increases consumer surplus and social welfare is not true. Specifically, when the copycat's product quality is sufficiently low, we have identified instances under which the presence of the copycat can actually reduce consumer surplus and social welfare. This finding suggests that the quote by Patrizio Bertelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Galante 2012</ref>) can be modified as follows: Copycats are totally bad except when the quality of these copycats are not too low.</p><p>There are several limitations to our modeling framework. First, we have assumed in the base model that copycats may enter the market speedily, presenting its products to consumers at the same time as the incumbent. To address this issue, we show in Extension 1 (see Section 6.1), that, even when this assumption is relaxed and the incumbent's product is launched well before the copycat, the key results obtained in the base model continue to hold. Second, we checked for the robustness of our formulation of the status utility of consumers. An alternative formulation of the status utility of copycat buyers is considered in Extension 2 (see Section 6.2). We showed that even when copycat buyers can obtain a higher status utility than that of the nonbuyers of either product (i.e., I or C), our key results continue to hold, albeit with different boundary conditions.</p><p>Next, we assumed throughout that the incumbent does not develop a lower-quality product to compete directly with the copycat. In a way, our findings actually lend support to this assumption because it was found that successful copycat entrants are likely to be high in physical resemblance to the incumbent's product but low in quality. This segmentation strategy of the copycat avoids intensive pricing competition from the incumbent to ensure its own successful entry. Thus, the copycat will not choose a quality that is sufficiently high and which would enable the incumbent to develop another product to compete directly with it. Future research could explore the conditions under which the incumbent would launch a lower quality product to compete.</p><p>Finally, in our base model and Extension 2 (see Section 6.2), we assumed that the buyers of C will always obtain a higher status utility than the nonbuyers (who bought nothing). However, when the market can identify C as fake, the market may view buyers of C as having a lower status utility than nonbuyers. Existing research suggests that the status of the buyers of C can be even lower than the nonbuyers. This result is due to "loss of face" when the buyers of C are known to be buying fake products in certain product categories or in certain subcultures where owners of copycats have lower social standing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gentry et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Wilcox et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Grubb and Grathwohl 1967</ref>. The analysis of this scenario is complex because there are instances under which a different threshold purchasing policy will occur: Consumers with wealth v i â [Ï I , 1] will buy I; consumers with wealth v i â [Ï C , Ï I ] do not buy anything because they are not wealthy enough to buy I and they are afraid of lower status utility if they are exposed; and consumers with wealth v i â [0, Ï C ] would buy C. Because of the noncontiguous purchasing policy under this scenario, the corresponding analysis is highly complex and our key results in the base model no longer hold. We defer this scenario for future research.</p><p>Marketing <ref type="bibr">Science, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Science, , vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 272-289, Â© 2016</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_31">INFORMS Firm Pricing Decision Case 1. k C â¤ Î»Î±/2</formula><p>Applying backward induction, we first consider Period 2.

Similarly, when q tends to 0, Ï I tends to Ï B I . Ï C tends to Ï B I (Î»Î±/2 â k C ). Hence, SS tends to SS B â Ï B I k C SS B â k C ((1 + k I )/2 â Î»/4). The term k C ((1 + k I )/2 â Î»/4</formula><p>) is also strictly greater than 0. Therefore, we have when q is sufficiently small, CS B &gt; CS and SS B &gt; SS. This completes the proof.</p></div>

It is nonmonotone in q.We then have Proposition 5.Proof of Proposition 6 Proof. 1. Benchmark case: Consumer purchasing decisions.

I maximizes its profit Ï B I (p I â k I )(1 â Ï B I ). We have p B I (k I + 1)/2 + Î»(1 + Î´)/4. Hence Ï B I ((1 â k I )/2 + Î»(1 + Î´)/4) 2 ; and Ï B I (k I + 1)/2 â Î»(1 + Î´)/4.

Outline of the proof: Applying backward induction, C chooses its entry decision optimally in the second stage given p I . We show that under the conditions presented in Proposition 1, I is optimal to select a p I in the first stage such that C cannot select any p C to have a positive profit if entering. Specifically, we divide the proof into two cases, i.e., k C â¤ Î»Î±/2 and k C &gt; Î»Î±/2. In the first case, when k C â¤ Î»Î±/2, we show that under the conditions in Proposition 1, C's best response in the second stage leads to Ï I 0. Therefore, C cannot enter the market. In the second case, when k C &gt; Î»Î±/2, we show that there are no feasible conditions under which I is optimal to choose a price such that C cannot have a positive profit. Therefore, C always enters the market when k C &gt; Î»Î±/2. Combining these two cases, we have Proposition 1.</p><p>Below we present the details of the proof. Consumer purchasing decisions. Ï 1 is solved by Ï I â¢ 1 â</p><p>. Ï C can be similarly solved by Ï C â¢ q â p C + Î»(Î±((1 + Ï C )/2) + (1 â Î±)(Ï I /2)) Î»(Î±(Ï C /2) + (1 â Î±)(Ï I /2)). We have Ï C (p C â Î±(Î»/2))/q.</p></div>			</div>
