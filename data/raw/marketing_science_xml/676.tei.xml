The proposed HB model presumes three tried and tested assumptions of Pareto/NBD models: (1) a Poisson purchase process, (2) a memoryless dropout process (i.e., constant hazard rate), and (3) heterogeneity across customers, while relaxing the independence assumption of the purchase and dropout rates and incorporating customer characteristics as covariates. The model also provides useful output for CRM, such as a customer-specific lifetime and survival rate, as by-products of the MCMC estimation.</p><p>Using three different types of databases-music CD for e-commerce, FSP data for a department store and a music CD chain, the HB model is compared against the benchmark Pareto/NBD model. The study demonstrates that recency-frequency data, in conjunction with customer behavior and characteristics, can provide important insights into direct marketing issues, such as the demographic profile of best customers and whether long-life customers spend more.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In CRM, it is important to know which customers are likely to be active and to be able to predict their future purchase patterns. This, in turn, allows the firm to take customized marketing action most suitable to each customer, as well as to estimate its current and future customer base for strategic planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Rust and</ref><ref type="bibr">Chung 2006, Sun 2006</ref>). Under a "noncontractual" setting, however, consumers do not declare that they become inactive, but simply stop conducting business with the firm. To judge customer attrition, practitioners often use ad hoc rules, for instance, a customer is considered to have dropped out if he/she has not made a purchase for over three months.</p><p>There are two problems with this kind of judgment. First, it is not clear why the period of inactivity is three months rather than two or four months. Although the criterion of "three months" may be chosen according to the experience of the firm, it hardly seems objective. Second, the criterion ignores customers' differences in purchase frequency. Given the same period of nonpurchase, customers with a long interpurchase time may still be active, whereas those with a short interpurchase time are more likely to be inactive. Recognition of customer heterogeneity is critical in such a context. This problem was first recognized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Schmittlein, Morrison, and Colombo (1987)</ref> (hereafter referred to as SMC). Based on common hypotheses about consumer behavior, SMC proposed a Pareto/NBD model that accounts for the relationship between recency and frequency, and derived the probability of an individual customer being active at a particular point in time. In their model, consumer behavior is characterized by (1) Poisson purchase (with purchase rate parameter ) and (2) exponential lifetime (with dropout rate parameter ). Further, and follow independent gamma distributions, which are formulated as a mixture distribution model. Although their work is highly regarded and follow-up research has been conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Fader et al. 2005a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kumar 2000, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schmittlen and Peterson 1994)</ref>, it is the increasing importance of new types of marketing, such as Database Marketing, CRM, and One-to-One Marketing, that has brought this model to the attention of researchers and practitioners.</p><p>In this research, the behaviorally based recencyfrequency (RF) analysis of SMC and others is extended to suit the micro focus of today's marketing. While adopting the theoretically sound behavioral assumptions of Pareto/NBD, the proposed approach 542 Marketing Science 28(3), pp. 541-553, © 2009 INFORMS captures customer heterogeneity through estimation of individual-specific parameters with a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In particular, this approach maintains the behavioral model of SMC but (1) replaces the analytical part of the heterogeneity mixture distribution with a simulation method and (2) incorporates unobservable measures such as a customer lifetime and an active/inactive binary indicator into the model as latent variables. By avoiding analytical aggregation, the model and its estimation become simpler, thereby permitting to accommodate various model extensions as follows.</p><p>First, the proposed model is more flexible in that the independence of purchase rate and dropout rate parameters, a crucial assumption in a Pareto/NBD model, can be relaxed. The parameter estimate of a Pareto/NBD model might be biased if this independence assumption were violated. The proposed model not only accommodates correlated data, but also allows the performing of statistical inference of the independence assumption on data.</p><p>Second, because the distribution of the purchase rate and dropout rate are estimated at the individual level as a byproduct of the MCMC method, the distribution of any customer-specific statistics that are functions of and can be obtained by simple algebra. Such statistics of managerial relevance include a probability of being active at a certain point in time, an expected lifetime, a one-year survival rate, and an expected number of transactions in a future period. The fact that a distribution rather than a point estimate of a statistic is obtained also permits the application of statistical inference at the individual level without being restricted by the asymptotic properties.</p><p>Third, hierarchical models, whereby customerspecific parameters are a function of covariates, can be constructed and estimated with ease. (a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Schmittlein and Peterson (1994)</ref> calibrate a Pareto/NBD model separately for each segment specified by the SIC code. The proposed model, by including segmentation variables in a hierarchical manner, allows estimation of all segments simultaneously, thereby increasing the degrees of freedom. The model can also incorporate nonnominal explanatory variables.</p><p>(b) To investigate the impact of customer characteristic variables on profitable lifetime duration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Reinartz and Kumar (2003)</ref> pursue a two-step approach: a lifetime duration is first estimated from RF data using a Pareto/NBD model, and then a proportional hazard model is constructed to link the lifetime duration (dependent variable) with characteristic variables (explanatory variables). A hierarchical model, whose dropout parameter is a function of customer characteristics, can achieve these in one step, providing the correct measures of error for statistical inference.</p><p>Mathematically, the approach pursued in a Pareto/ NBD model is so-called empirical Bayes, whereby the same data are used for the likelihood (customerspecific purchase and survival functions) as well as for estimating the prior (a mixture distribution), resulting in the overestimation of precision. 1 Although no threat is posed if the sample size is large or the mixture distribution is estimated from separate data, empirical Bayes is an approximation of a hierarchical Bayes method in the Bayesian paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gelman et al. 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In the next section, the proposed model is described and compared against the Pareto/NBD model. Section 3 explains the estimation by an MCMC method. Section 4 presents empirical analyses with three data sets of various types, comparing the model's performance against that of the Pareto/NBD model. Section 5 presents the conclusions, limitations of the model, and future directions.</p></div>

While active, each customer makes purchases according to a Poisson process with rate .</p><p>Assumption 2 (A2). Exponential lifetime.

Because their justification is documented elsewhere, including SMC, further elaboration is not provided here for brevity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterogeneity Across Customers</head><p>Assumption 3 (A3). Individuals' purchase rates and dropout rates follow a multivariate lognormal distribution.</p><p>Unlike a Pareto/NBD model, whereby independent gamma distributions are assumed for and , this assumption permits a correlation between purchase and dropout processes.

Lifetime starts at time 0 (when the first transaction occurs and/or the membership starts) and customer transactions are monitored until time T . x is the number of repeat transactions observed in the time period 0 T , with the last purchase (xth repeat) occurring at t x . Hence, recency is defined as T − t x . is an unobserved customer lifetime. Using these mathematical notations, the preceding model assumptions can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P x = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ T x x! e − T if &gt; T x x! e − if ≤ T x = 0 1 2 (1) f = e − ≥ 0 (2) log log ∼ MVN 0 = 0 = 2 2 (3)</formula><p>where MVN denotes a multivariate normal distribution. Some useful individual-level statistics that will be shown in the subsequent empirical analyses are derived in the Technical Appendix, found at http:// 2 A gamma distribution is thought to be more flexible than a lognormal distribution because the former can have a mode at 0 or an interior mode, depending on whether the value of the shape parameter is less than 1 or not, whereas the latter accommodates only an interior mode.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Introducing Latent Variables</head><p>Our estimation approach is guided by exploiting the reason for not being able to estimate and individually in the empirical Bayes framework of a Pareto/NBD model.</p><p>In the Pareto/NBD model, as shown in the Technical Appendix, found at http://mktsci.pubs. informs.org,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Prior: i ∼ gamma r , i ∼ gamma s if active at T i , posterior: i data i ∼ gamma r + x i + T i , posterior: i data i ∼ gamma s + T i , if inactive at T i and dropout at y i &lt; T i , posterior: i data i ∼ gamma r + x i + y i , posterior: i data i ∼ gamma s + 1 + y i .</formula><p>The above implies that, unless unobserved variables (i.e., whether customer i is active at T i and, if not, the dropout time y i &lt; T i ) are known, one cannot take advantage of the simple Bayesian updating for the conjugate priors. This is the very reason for the complex estimation process associated with the Pareto/NBD model. Thus, let us introduce these unobservables as latent variables in our model. For notational simplicity, subscript i is dropped in the following discussion. z is defined as 1 if a customer is active at time T and 0 otherwise. Another latent variable is a dropout time y when z = 0 (i.e., inactive). If we know z and y, then the likelihood function for RF Marketing Science 28(3), pp. 541-553, © 2009 INFORMS data (x t x T ) becomes the following simple expression for x &gt; 0.</p><p>Case z = 1 (customer is active at T ) P xth purchase at t x and active until T and no purchase between t x T</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= x t x−1 x x e − t x × e − T × e − T −t x = x t x−1 x x e − + T</formula><p>Case z = 0 (customer dropout at y ≤ T )</p><p>P xth purchase at t x and no purchase between t x y and dropout at y ≤ T</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= x t x−1 x x e − t x × e − y−t x × e − y = x t x−1 x x e − + y t x ≤ y ≤ T</formula><p>Combining the two cases, a more compact notation for the likelihood function can result:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L x t x T z y = x t x−1 x x 1−z e − + zT + 1−z y (5)</formula><p>For x = 0, there is no repeat purchase and t x = 0. Thus x = 0 and t x−1 x are undefined. The appropriate likelihood function is e − + T for z = 1, and e − + y for z = 0. Hence, Equation (5) becomes L x = 0 t x T z y = 1−z e − + zT + 1−z y . Because we observe neither z nor y, however, we treat them as missing data and apply a data augmentation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tanner and Wong 1987)</ref>. To simulate z in our MCMC estimation procedure, we can use the following expression for the probability of a customer being active at T , or equivalently z = 1, derived in the Technical Appendix (available at http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P &gt; T T t x = P z = 1 T t x = 1 1 + / + e + T −t x − 1 (6)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Estimation by Data Augmentation</head><p>Because parameter estimates for the purchase and dropout processes will be customer specific, index i (i = 1 I) is reinstated to indicate individual customers. Let us denote the customer-specific parameters as i = log i log i ', which is normally distributed with mean d i and variance-covariance matrix 0 as in Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>). Our objective is to estimate parameters { i y i z i ∀ i 0 } from observed recency and frequency data {x i t x i T i ∀ i}.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">E-Commerce Data for CDNOW</head><p>The first data set is CDNOW data used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fader et al. (2005a, b)</ref>, kindly made available for our study. The database contains e-commerce transactions over 78 weeks (1/1/97∼6/30/98) at the CDNOW website. It includes data on 2,357 customers who became a member of CDNOW during the first 12 weeks. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fader et al. (2005a, b)</ref>, the first 39 weeks of the data are used for model calibration and the second 39 weeks are used for model validation. Thus, depending on when customers became a member, the length of the observation (T ) in the calibration sample varies from 27 to 39 weeks. Note that almost 60% of the customers (i.e., 1,411 customers) make no repeat purchases whatsoever during the calibration period (i.e., x = 0 and only an initial purchase), which makes the estimation challenging. Because the data set did not contain any customer demographic data, we used a dollar amount of the initial purchase as the only covariate. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> summarizes the descriptive statistics of the calibration sample.</p><p>The MCMC steps were repeated 14,000 iterations, of which the last 4,000 were used to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters. Convergence was monitored visually and checked with the Geweke test <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Geweke 1992)</ref>. The proposed HB model was compared against the benchmark Pareto/NBD model for fit in the calibration period and prediction in the validation period. For disaggregate performance measures, correlation and mean squared errors (MSE) between predicted and observed numbers of transactions for individual customers were used. For an aggregate measure, mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) between predicted   <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the predicted number of transactions during the validation period averaged across individuals, conditional on the number of transactions made during the calibration period. This measure was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fader et al. (2005a, b)</ref> as well.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reports the estimation result of the HB models for the posterior means of the parameters and their 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles in the parentheses as a standard-error-like measure. The marginal loglikelihood suggests that M2 is better than M1. Note that the left-hand side of the regression is a logarithm of and , and the magnitude of the coefficients must be interpreted accordingly. The only covariate, the amount of an initial purchase, is significantly positive for purchase frequency. This implies that customers with a larger initial purchase (in dollars) tend to shop more often. Lifetime does not seem to be related to the amount so that customers with large and small initial purchases are equally likely to remain active. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> is a scatter plot of the posterior means of i and i (i = 1 2357) for individual customers. The pattern does not suggest any particular relationship between the two parameters. This observation is also supported from the fact that, for the intercept-only model, the correlation between log( ) and log( ) was  0.05, according to the estimated variance-covariance matrix ( 0 ) of the normal mixture distribution. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The estimate is not significantly different from 0, which can be confirmed from Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the distribution of the estimated correlation for M1 obtained from a byproduct of the 4000 MCMC iterations. Both the scatter plot and the histogram imply that the independence assumption of and in the Pareto/NBD model holds for this data set.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> reports six customer-specific statistics: the posterior means of i and i along with their 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> an expected lifetime after the last transaction, a survival rate after one year, the probability of being active at the end of the calibration period, and the expected number of transactions during the validation period, for the best and worst 10 customers with respect to the last statistic. These statistics are useful in actual CRM, for example, by providing customer ranking. The last three rows of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> report the average, minimum, and maximum of the six statistics for the 2,357 customers. For example, the probability of being active at the end of the calibration period (39th week) varies from 0.000 to 1.000 with the average being 0.425. The expected number of transactions during the validation period ranges from 0.00 to 22.59 with the average being 0.63. Because the HB model produces a complete distribution of i and i at the customer level as a byproduct of the MCMC method { g i and g i ; g = 1 4000; i = 1 2357}, it is a simple algebraic computation to obtain the distribution of any statistic that is a function of and . Statistics in the last four columns are obtained using Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>), (6), and (8), respectively, in such a straightforward manner. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In contrast, the last two statistics are claimed to be the main result by SMC through a complex derivation <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>, and the appendix in their paper), and their computation involves nonstandard hypergeometric functions of various kinds. The fact that a distribution rather than a point estimate of a statistic is obtained also permits the application of statistical inference at the individual level.</p><p>Customer 2,357 is interesting because she made 21 repeat purchases during the first 4.7 weeks and then stopped buying thereafter. This is the reason for her high purchase rate i , the low probability of being active at the end of the calibration period, and the small expected number of transactions in the validation period. Managerially, the ability of the proposed model to provide information on individual customers with ease, is especially suited to CRM application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">FSP Data for a Department Store</head><p>This data set contains shopping records for the members of a frequent shopper program (FSP) at a department store in Japan. It sells a wide variety of merchandise ranging from apparel, interior decoration, electronics, toys, to gourmet food on over 10 floors. The period of data covers 52 weeks starting from July 1, 2000.</p><p>We drew a random sample of 400 customers who had joined the FSP during the month of July 2000, and hence, their shopping data were available from their first purchase as a member until June 29, 2001. The first and the last 26 weeks of the data were used for calibration and validation, respectively. Multiple receipts at different cashiers within the same day were consolidated as one spending, and returns (negative spending, credit, etc.) were ignored. The descriptive statistics for the calibration period are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>. The number of repeat purchases x i ranges from 0 for 17 customers to 101, implying that some customers made purchases almost every other day. 8 Inspection of the distributions of interpurchase times within customers reveals that our data set appears to satisfy the Poisson assumption.</p><p>The database contains very limited information on customer characteristics: gender, age, and address. Because the majority of the shoppers visit the store by means of public transportation and through transit during commuting, a geographical distance between the home address and the store does not necessary correspond to the store accessibility. Instead, we constructed a covariate called FOOD, the fraction of store visits on which food items were purchased, as the proxy for accessibility. 9 Thus, FOOD ranges from 0 to 1: 1 if foods were purchased on every shopping occasion, 0.5 if purchased on half of the shopping occasions, and 0 if no foods were purchased on any of the shopping occasions. Another covariate, average spending per trip, was created from the customer purchase records. To keep the scales comparable among the covariates, the unit for the average spending was defined as the 10 −5 yen and AGE as one-hundredth of the actual age.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> compares the aggregate and disaggregate fits of the two models in the calibration and validation samples. Both models provide similar fit, however, the HB seems to perform slightly better for this data set. This fact can be seen from a weekly tracking of the cumulative number of transactions in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the conditional expectation of future transactions given the number of transactions made during the calibration period, also results in similar fits.    only an intercept (M1) and two covariates (M2). For the intercept-only model, correlation between the purchase and dropout rates is not significantly different from 0, satisfying the assumption of the Pareto/NBD model. This is also evident from the scatter plot of the posterior means of the individual-level parameters, i and i , shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. As covariates are added, the estimated coefficients remain stable and the marginal log-likelihood increases, where the full HB is chosen as the best model. Significant covariates for the purchase rate are average spending and FOOD, the fraction of store visits on which food items were purchased and a proxy for store accessibility. Age and gender do not affect the purchase rate. For the dropout rate, none of the covariates is significant. Customer lifetime does not differ by the amount of average spending, food/nonfood buyers, age, or gender. This implies that food buyers and small spenders visit the store more often-the finding consistent with the story told by the store manager. Although food buyers spend a smaller amount on each shopping trip, they visit the store often enough such that the retailer considers food shoppers as their key clients. Because of lower margins on food items relative to other categories, such as jewelry, fashion items, and interior decoration, the food section in itself is not particularly profit making; however, the retailer recently renovated the entire food floor featuring fancy gourmet and imported foods in an effort to attract this target segment.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Retail FSP Data for a Music CD Chain</head><p>The third data set was obtained from an FSP of a large chain for music CD. The period covered 52 weeks starting from September 1, 2003. We extracted 500 random customers who had joined the FSP with the initial purchase (trial) during the first quarter and also at least one repeat purchase during the first half. The first 26 weeks and the last 26 weeks of the data were used as calibration and validation samples, respectively. The available customer characteristics were the amount of the initial purchase, age, and gender. The descriptive statistics of the calibration sample are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref> compares the aggregate and disaggregate fits of the two models in the calibration and validation samples. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> is a weekly tracking of the cumulative number of transactions, and Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows the  conditional expectation of future transactions given the number of transactions made during the calibration period. The HB model seems to perform slightly better than the Pareto/NBD model.  Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref> shows the estimated coefficients of the nested HB models, in which the full model (M3) has the best marginal log-likelihood. For the interceptonly model (M1), correlation between the purchase and dropout rates is not significantly different from 0, just like the previous two data sets. This can be seen from a scatter plot of the posterior means of and for the 500 customers in Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>. The only significant parameter is the amount of initial purchase on the purchase rate. It implies that customers with a larger spending on their first purchase tend to visit the chain more often. No difference in terms of age and gender is found on purchase frequency. The amount of initial purchase, age, and gender are not related to customer lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>A great deal has changed since the work of SMC almost 20 years ago. Advances in information technology, combined with conceptual development in Database Marketing, CRM, and One-to-One Marketing, allow even unsophisticated firms to pursue customized marketing actions of some form at the individual customer level. Marketing has seen some shift from an aggregate to a disaggregate focus. In keeping with this change, the Pareto/NBD model of customer-base analysis was updated, resulting in a hierarchical Bayes model, which was then estimated by an MCMC method. The HB model presumes three tried and tested assumptions of Pareto/NBD: (1) a Poisson purchase process, (2) a memoryless dropout process (i.e., constant hazard rate), and (3) heterogeneity across customers, while relaxing Pareto/NBD's independence assumption of the purchase and dropout processes. Because customer heterogeneity is captured as a prior in a hierarchical Bayesian framework rather than through a mixture distribution, the entire modeling effort can bypass all the complications associated with aggregation, which is left to MCMC simulation.</p><p>The HB model was shown to perform well in the empirical analysis using three data sets of various types. Outputs, obtained from by-products of the MCMC estimation, included individual level i and i , an expected lifetime, a retention rate, the probability of being active, and an expected number of future transactions. These customer-specific statistics   demonstrate that recency-frequency data, in conjunction with customer behavior and characteristics, can provide important insights into direct marketing issues, such as the demographic profile of best customers and whether long-life customers spend more. The current study also confirmed, in all three data sets, the independence assumption of the purchase and dropout rates for the Pareto/NBD model, which, in turn, provided sound performance in fit and prediction. A Pareto/NBD model should continue to perform well, as long as the independence of the purchase and dropout processes holds. Here, the HB model can provide useful information to assess the validity of this assumption through (1) a scatter plot of the posterior means of individual level and and (2) a statistical inference on the correlation between log( ) and log( ), obtained from 0 of an interceptonly model.</p><p>One weakness of the HB model is that the closedform expressions on the statistics for a "randomly" chosen customer, such as the probability of being active and the expected number of future purchases, do not exist. Closed form can provide intuitive understanding of the aggregate market behavior as a whole by calculating comparative statistics. In the HB model, aggregate statistics must be constructed by simulation. Given that both Pareto/NBD and HB models have resulted in similar predictive performance, the two models can complement each other. A Pareto/NBD model can describe the aggregate customer response in a parsimonious manner for firms' strategic purposes, whereas the individual focus of the HB model could be used in actual operationalization of customized marketing.</p><p>Several directions are possible in extending this research. One is a substantive investigation of the relationship between customer lifetime and profitability in noncontractual businesses. Though we did not find an evidence for the relationship between lifetime and average spending from our department store data, the current study is more methodological in nature and falls short of drawing any substantive conclusions. Pioneering research by <ref type="bibr">Kumar (2000, 2003)</ref> can be improved upon in various ways using the HB model. First, the independence assumption of and in a Pareto/NBD model, on which their entire analysis was based, can be relaxed. Second, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Reinartz and Kumar (2000)</ref> defined lifetime as the duration for which the probability of a customer being alive dropped below a threshold of c, after carefully justifying the value to be c = 0 5. That still seems subjective, however. The estimate of individual available from the HB model can be used as an objective measure of customer lifetime. Third, the HB model can Marketing Science 28(3), pp. 541-553, © 2009 INFORMS reveal the link between customer lifetime and characteristics in a one-step estimation, with accurate statistical inference, instead of the two-step estimation they employed.</p><p>The second natural direction is to extend the model from transactions to dollar amounts by incorporating monetary value from RFM data ). Such a model could provide valuable insights into customer lifetime value and customer equity, as was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fader et al. (2005b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Reinarts and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kumar (2000, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The third direction is to relax the assumption of the Poisson purchase process so that interpurchase time can take a more general form in distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allenby et al. 1999)</ref>. A Poisson process implies random purchase occurrence (constant hazard rate) with an exponentially distributed interpurchase time. While nonpatrons might make purchases at random, loyal customers generally purchase at more regular intervals. A model that can capture behavioral differences in dynamic purchase pattern could provide valuable insights into CRM. One approach is to incorporate time-varying covariates as a function of log( ), which results in a time-varying hazard function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gönül and Hofstede 2006)</ref>. This extension, however, puts more burden on the part of data collection, because the model estimation requires not just recency and frequency but the complete purchase history.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2Weekly Time-Series Tracking Plot for CDNOW Data</figDesc></figure>

Their approach, however, does not take advantage of the HB framework in that none of the aforementioned three issues are addressed.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">To facilitate convergence by allowing even drawing from the parameter space of , it sometimes helps to multiply the expression (6) by a prior that imposes an upper bound on the probability for z = 1. This is because when z = 1, MLE of is 0, implying no dropout.4  The author appreciates Siddharth S. Singh, Sharad Borle, and Dipak C. Jain for pointing out the fact that the conditioning of was missing from this distribution in the earlier version of the manuscript.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">To check whether the independence assumption of Pareto/NBD is satisfied, correlation of 0 must be tested on the intercept-only model but not the covariate model. This is because if covariates explain the correlation between and completely, then no correlation remains in that 0 .6  The implied 95% confidence intervals for the individual-level parameters i and i are wide because the likelihood involves only the RF data from that customer. The Pareto/NBD model is expected to produce even wider 95% confidence intervals, whereby their rough magnitude can be inferred from the variance of the posterior gamma distributions shown in §3.1.</note>
